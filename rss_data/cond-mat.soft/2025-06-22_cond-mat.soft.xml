      <title>Mean first passage time of active Brownian particles in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a key metric for understanding transport, search, and escape processes in stochastic systems. While well characterized for passive Brownian particles, its behavior in active systems-such as active Brownian particles (ABPs)-remains less understood due to their self-propelled, nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we formulate and analyze an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) to characterize the MFPT of ABPs in two-dimensional domains, including circular, annular, and elliptical regions. For annular regions, we analyze the MFPT of ABPs under various boundary conditions. Our results reveal rich behaviors in the MFPT of ABPs that differ fundamentally from those of passive particles. Notably, the MFPT exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the initial position and orientation of the particle, with maxima often occurring away from the domain center. We also find that increasing swimming speed can either increase or decrease the MFPT depending on the geometry and initial orientation. Asymptotic analysis of the PDE in the weak-activity regime provides insight into how activity modifies escape statistics of the particles in different geometries. Finally, our numerical solutions of the PDE are validated against Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of charged particle systems including triple bound states -- and the Collaboration Lviv-Rostock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honoring the hundredth anniversary of the birthday of Ihor R. Yuknovskii we analyze new developments in the statistical thermodynamics of Coulomb systems. The basic idea of this work is to demonstrate that the exponential potential used in the first papers of Yukhnovskii is an appropriate reference system for a description of classical and quantum charged particle systems. We briefly discuss the collaboration between the groups of Ihor R. Yuknovskii in Lviv and G\"unter Kelbg in Rostock and analyze several approaches based on pair correlation functions and cluster expansion in the classical as well as in the quantum case. Finally, we discuss the progress in the statistical description of bound states of three particles as in helium plasmas and in MgCl$_2$-solutions in the classical case and present new results regarding the influence of three-particle bound states. In particular, we give new expressions for the cluster integrals and the mass action functions of helium atoms and ionic triple associates as well as for the equation of state (EoS).</description>

      <title>From toroids to helical tubules: Kirigami-inspired programmable assembly of two-periodic curved crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biology is full of intricate molecular structures whose geometries are inextricably linked to their function. Many of these structures exhibit varying curvature, such as the helical structure of the bacterial flagellum, which is critical for their motility. Because synthetic analogues of these shapes could be valuable platforms for nanotechnologies, including drug delivery and plasmonics, controllable synthesis of variable-curvature structures of various material systems, from fullerenes to supramolecular assemblies, has been a long-standing goal. Like two-dimensional crystals, these structures have a two-periodic symmetry, but unlike standard two-dimensional crystals, they are embedded in three dimensions with complex, spatially-varying curvatures that cause the structures to close upon themselves in one or more dimensions. Here, we develop and implement a design strategy to program the self-assembly of a complex spectrum of two-periodic curved crystals with variable periodicity, spatial dimension, and topology, spanning from toroids to achiral serpentine tubules to both left- and right-handed helical tubules. Our design strategy uses a kirigami-based mapping of 2D planar tilings to 3D curved crystals that preserves the periodicity, two-fold rotational symmetries, and subunit dimensions via the arrangement of disclination defects. We survey the modular geometry of these curved crystals and infer the addressable subunit interactions required to assemble them from triangular subunits. To demonstrate this design strategy, we program the self-assembly of toroids, helical- and serpentine-tubules from DNA origami subunits. A simulation model of the assembly pathways reveals physical considerations for programming the geometric specificity of angular folds in the curved crystal required to avoid defect-mediated misassembly.</description>

      <title>Excluded volume effect of surfactant ligands on the shape of nascent nanocrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.</description>

      <title>Jamming as a topological satisfiability transition with contact number hyperuniformity and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jamming transition between flow and amorphous-solid states exhibits paradoxical properties characterized by hyperuniformity (suppressed spatial fluctuations) and criticality (hyperfluctuations), whose origin remains unclear. Here we model the jamming transition by a topological satisfiability transition in a minimum network model with simultaneously hyperuniform distributions of contacts, diverging length scales and scale-free clusters. We show that these phenomena stem from isostaticity and mechanical stability: the former imposes a global equality, and the latter local inequalities on arbitrary sub-systems. This dual constraint bounds contact number fluctuations from both above and below, limiting them to scale with the surface area. The hyperuniform and critical exponents of the network model align with those of frictionless jamming, suggesting a new universality class of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Our results provide a minimal, dynamics-independent framework for jamming criticality and hyperuniformity in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic elastomers: A complete phase-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.</description>

      <title>Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable jammed sphere packings with a wide range of particle dispersities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. We find that the fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing crystallization or fractionation. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 96% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 154%.</description>

      <title>Thin active nematohydrodynamic layers: asymptotic theories and instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order.
  Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.</description>

      <title>A unifying perspective on measuring transient planar extensional viscosity from exponential shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity.
  The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi &gt; 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking motility of an active hinge in a crowded channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment [Son et al., Soft Matter, 2024, 20,2777-2788] showed that self-propelled particles confined within a circular boundary filled with granular medium spontaneously form a motile cluster that stays on the boundary. This cluster exhibits persistent (counter)clockwise motion driven by symmetry breaking, which arises from a positive feedback between the asymmetry of the cluster and those of the surrounding granular medium. To investigate this symmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the dynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the hinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of the granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion. Furthermore, we observe an abrupt transition in the configuration of passive particles that sustain hinge motility as the hinge's maximum angle relative to the channel wall increases. These findings point to the possibility of designing superstructures composed of passive granular media doped with a small number of active elements, whose dynamics modes can be switched by tuning the properties of their components.</description>

      <title>Measuring Cyclic Tensile Properties of Fluids with Composite Harmonic Exponential Waveforms (CHEW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building off recent advances on how to practically use exponential shear in a torsional rheometer to compute transient planar extensional viscosity (Kroo et al. 2025a), we extend the technique to cyclic tensile measurements in complex fluids and soft solids. An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying approach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and oscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied. Analogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing in the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the evolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential cycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform locally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material stretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar extensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We demonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to complex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit progressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of extensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff material (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its extensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that is directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this with a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during successive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over successive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via stretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a promising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical stretching of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectionally manipulated skyrmions in an orientationally chiral system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, originally from condensed matter physics, have been widely explored in various physical systems, including soft matter. A crucial challenge in manipulating topological solitary waves like skyrmions is controlling their flow on demand. Here, we control the arbitrary moving direction of skyrmions in a chiral liquid crystal system by adjusting the bias of the applied alternate current electric field. Specifically, the velocity, including both moving direction and speed can be continuously changed. The motion control of skyrmions originates from the symmetry breaking of the topological structure induced by flexoelectric-polarization effect.

      <title>Line Tension Reshapes Nucleation at Surface Edges: A Generalized Theory for Nanopore Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in Colloidal Crystals on Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex physics of self-assembly in colloidal crystals on deformable interfaces and surfaces poses interesting possibilities for the designability and synthesis of next-generation metamaterials. The goal of this article is to characterize instabilities arising in colloidal crystals assembled on fluid membranes. The colloidal particles are modeled as pair-wise interacting point particles, constrained to lie on a fluid membrane and yet free to reorganize, and the membrane's elastic energy is modeled via the Helfrich energy. We find that when a collection of particles is arranged on a planar membrane in some regular fashion -- such as periodic lattice -- then the regular configuration admits bifurcations to non-planar configurations. Using the Bloch-wave anstaz for the mode of instabilities, we present a parameteric analysis of the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes. We find that instabilities can occur through two distinct kinds of modes, when the parameters belong in certain physically interesting regimes, referred to as long-wavenumber modes ($L$ modes) and short-wavenumber modes ($S$ modes) in the article. We discuss some connections between these results and recent experiments, as well as the open problem of budding in biomembranes.</description>

      <title>Cascade at local yield strain for silica and metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of unusal \emph{first} plastic events in silica and metallic glasses in the shear startup regime at applied strain two orders of magnitude smaller than yield strain. The (non-Affine) particle displacement field during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the \emph{same} applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation, and identified by a ``cell based cluster analysis'' method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a ``soft matrix'' probe recently developed by some of us. In each case we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.</description>

      <title>An equation of motion for unsteady frictional slip pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.</description>

      <title>High-speed quantitative nanomechanical mapping by photothermal off-resonance atomic force microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure surface topography of solid, soft, and living matter at the nanoscale. Moreover, by mapping forces as a function of distance to the surface, AFM can provide a wealth of information beyond topography, with nanomechanical properties as a prime example. Here we present a method based on photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT) to increase the speed of such force spectroscopy measurements by at least an order of magnitude, thereby enabling high-throughput, quantitative nanomechanical mapping of a wide range of materials. Specifically, we use photothermal actuation to modulate the position of the AFM probe at frequencies that far exceed those possible with traditional actuation by piezo-driven z scanners. Understanding and accounting for the microscale thermal and mechanical behavior of the AFM probe, we determine the resulting probe position at sufficient accuracy to allow rapid and quantitative nanomechanical examination of polymeric and metallic materials.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.</description>

      <title>Polar solitons in a nonpolar chiral soft matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar solitons, i.e., solitonic waves accompanying asymmetry of geometry or phase, have garnered attention in polar systems, such as ferroelectric or magnetoelectric materials, where they play a critical role in topological transitions and nonreciprocal responses to external fields. A key question is whether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic polarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with nematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an alternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a pair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While head-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail collision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of solitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions, can be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field. Simulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through balancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric effect drives their rotational behaviors. The discovery of polar solitons in nonpolar systems expands the understanding of topological solitons, opening new avenues for dynamic control in soft matter systems, with potential applications in nonreciprocal responsive materials and topological information storage.</description>

      <title>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Magic sizes enable minimal-complexity, high-fidelity assembly of programmable shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with precise, finite sizes and well-defined architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (the number of distinct subunit types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we study icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are disclinations at sites of rotational symmetry. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest-complexity, highest-symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust, high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large, yet precise, finite sizes. The optimal complexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12 times fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental cost required to achieve high fidelity assembly of large targets. This symmetry-based principle for pruning off-target assembly generalizes to diverse architectures with different topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>
