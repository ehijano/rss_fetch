      <title>Digit quantum simulation of a fermion field in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Detecting high-dimensional entanglement and characterization of quantum channels using moments of the generalized positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement is a valuable resource for several quantum information processing tasks, and is often characterized by the Schmidt number and specific classes of entangled states beyond qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems. We propose a criterion to detect high-dimensional entanglement, focusing on determining the Schmidt number of quantum states and identifying significant classes of PPT and NPT entangled states. Our approach relies on evaluating moments of generalized positive maps which can be efficiently simulated in real experiments without the requirement of full-state tomography. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection scheme through various illustrative examples. As a direct application, we explore the implications of our moment-based detection schemes in identifying useful quantum channels such as non-Schmidt number breaking channels and non-entanglement breaking channels. Finally, we present the operational implication of our proposed moment criterion through its manifestation in channel discrimination tasks.</description>

      <title>On-demand generation of entangled photons pairs in the telecom O-band from nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. The O-band is particularly advantageous because of its minimal chromatic dispersion and transmission loss in optical fibers, making it well-suited for long-distance quantum networks. Site-controlled nanowire quantum dots have emerged as a promising platform for the on-demand generation of single and entangled photons, offering high extraction efficiency and the potential for scalable fabrication in large uniform arrays. However, their operation has been largely restricted to the visible and first near-infrared (NIR-I) windows. Here, we demonstrate an on-demand bright source of entangled photon pairs with high fidelity in the telecom O-band based on site-controlled nanowire quantum dots. We measure a fine-structure splitting of 4.6 $\mu$eV, verifying the suitability of the quantum dot for generating high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs. Full quantum state tomography of the two-photon state generated by the biexciton\hyph exciton cascade reveals a maximum fidelity of $85.8\% \pm 1.1\%$ to the $\Phi^+$ Bell state, and a maximum concurrence of $75.1\% \pm 2.1\%$. We estimate the source efficiency at the first lens to be 12.5$\%$. This bright, scalable, and deterministic source of entangled photons in the telecom range represents a valuable step forward in advancing practical quantum applications at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic trilemma of efficient measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the consequences of assuming that the quantum measurement process -- i.e., the physical realization of a measurement through an interaction between the system to be measured with a measuring device -- is thermodynamically closable, and thus amenable to thermodynamic analysis. Our results show that this assumption leads to a fundamental tension between the following three statements: (i), the measurement process is consistent with the second and third laws of thermodynamics; (ii), the measurement process is decomposed into two independent sub-processes: a bistochastic interaction between system and measuring device, followed by a readout mechanism on the measuring device; and (iii), the measurement on the system is efficient, i.e., characterized by operations that are completely purity-preserving and represented by a single measurement operator, thus including the von Neumann--L\"uders and the square-root state reduction rules. Any two of the above statements necessarily exclude the third. As a consequence, efficient measurements are fundamentally at odds with the laws of thermodynamics, lest we abandon the universal applicability of the unitary interaction-based indirect measurement model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Analog of Delsarte's Linear Programming Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents results in quantum error correction within the context of finite dimensional quantum metric spaces. In classical error correction, a focal problem is the study of large codes of metric spaces. For a class of finite metric spaces that are also metric association schemes, Delsarte introduced a method of using linear programming to compute upper bounds on the size of codes. Within quantum error correction, there is an analogous study of large quantum codes of quantum metric spaces and, in the setting of quantum Hamming space, a quantum analog of Delsarte's method was discovered by Shor and Laflamme and independently by Rains. Later, Bumgardner introduced an analogous method for single-spin codes, or quantum codes related to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. The main contribution of this thesis is a generalization of the results of Shor, Laflamme, Rains, and Bumgardner to a class of finite dimensional quantum metric spaces analogous to metric association schemes of the classical case.</description>

      <title>Quantum stick-slip motion in nanoscaled friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction in atomistic systems is usually described by the classical Prandtl-Tomlinson model suitable for capturing the dragging force of a nanoparticle in a periodic potential. Here we consider the quantum mechanical version of this model in which the dissipation is facilitated by releasing heat to an external bath reservoir. The time evolution of the system is captured with the Liouville-von Neumann equation through the density matrix of the system in the Markov approximation. We examine several kinetic and dissipative properties of the nanoparticle by delineating classical vs quantum mechanical effects. We find that that the Landau-Zener tunneling is a key factor in the overall reduction of the frictional dissipation when compared to the classical motion in which such tunneling is absent. This in-depth study analyzes the interplay between velocity, strength of interaction, and temperature to control the frictional process and provide useful guidelines for experimental data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Time-adaptive single-shot crosstalk detector on superconducting quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum crosstalk which stems from unwanted interference of quantum operations with nearby qubits is a major source of noise or errors in a quantum processor. In the context of shared quantum computing, it is challenging to mitigate the crosstalk effect between quantum computations being simultaneously run by multiple users since the exact spatio-temporal gate distributions are not apparent due to privacy concerns. It is therefore important to develop techniques for accurate detection and mitigation of crosstalk to enable high-fidelity quantum computing. Assuming prior knowledge of crosstalk parameters, we propose a time-adaptive detection method leveraging spectator qubits and multiple quantum coherence to amplify crosstalk-induced perturbations. We demonstrate its utility in detecting random sparsely distributed crosstalk within a time window. Our work evaluates its performance in two scenarios: simulation using an artificial noise model with gate-induced crosstalk and always-on idlings channels; and the simulation using noise sampled from an IBM quantum computer parametrised by the reduced HSA error model. The presented results show our method's efficacy hinges on the dominance of single-qubit coherent noise across channels, and the impact of angle mismatching is suppressed as spectator qubits increase. From simulation using real-device noise parameters, our strategy outperforms the previous constant-frequency detection method of Harper et. al. [arXiv: 2402.02753 (2024)] in the detection success rate, achieving an average detection success probability of $0.852\pm 0.022$ (equally scaled noise channels) and $0.933\pm0.024$ (asymmetrically scaled noise channels) from 1 to 7 crosstalk counts.</description>

      <title>Combined Quantum and Post-Quantum Security for Earth-Satellite Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental deployment of quantum communication over Earth-satellite channels opens the way to a secure global quantum Internet. In this work, we present results from a real-time prototype quantum key distribution (QKD) system, which entails the development of optical systems including the encoding of entangled photon pairs, the development of transmitters for quantum signaling through an emulated Earth-satellite channel, and the development of quantum-decoding receivers. A unique aspect of our system is the integration of QKD with existing cryptographic methods to ensure quantum-resistant security, even at low-key rates. In addition, we report the use of specially designed error-reconciliation codes that optimize the security versus key-rate trade-off. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, a deployment of the BBM92 protocol that offers both post-quantum security via the advanced encryption standard (AES) and quantum security via an entanglement-based QKD protocol. If either the AES or the QKD is compromised through some adversary attack, our system still delivers state-of-the-art communications secure against future quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the 2-Local Stoquastic Hamiltonian problem on a 2D square lattice is StoqMA-complete. We achieve this by extending the spatially sparse circuit construction of Oliveira and Terhal, as well as the perturbative gadgets of Bravyi, DiVincenzo, Oliveira, and Terhal. Our main contributions demonstrate StoqMA circuits can be made spatially sparse and that geometrical, stoquastic-preserving, perturbative gadgets can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient quantum algorithms for diffusion probability models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably talking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have spurred the development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which hold the potential to achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms are pivotal in automating the design of high-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However, existing QAS algorithms grapple with excessively large search spaces, resulting in significant computational complexity when searching large-scale quantum circuits. To address this challenge, we propose a Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS) framework. Our framework initially employs QAS to identify optimal circuit topologies and subsequently utilizes an efficient QAS to fine-tune gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters from the topology search phase, thereby eliminating the need to train from scratch. By decoupling the extensive search space into topology and gate-type components, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance topologies, significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical simulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy scenario, demonstrate that the TD-QAS framework enhances the efficiency of QAS algorithms by enabling them to identify high-performance quantum circuits with lower computational complexity. These results suggest that TD-QAS will deepen our understanding of VQA and have broad applicability in future QAS algorithms.</description>

      <title>Purest Quantum State Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise identification of quantum states under noise constraints is essential for quantum information processing. In this study, we generalize the classical best arm identification problem to quantum domains, designing methods for identifying the purest one within $K$ unknown $n$-qubit quantum states using $N$ samples. %, with direct applications in quantum computation and quantum communication. We propose two distinct algorithms: (1) an algorithm employing incoherent measurements, achieving error $\exp\left(- \Omega\left(\frac{N H_1}{\log(K) 2^n }\right) \right)$, and (2) an algorithm utilizing coherent measurements, achieving error $\exp\left(- \Omega\left(\frac{N H_2}{\log(K) }\right) \right)$, highlighting the power of quantum memory. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound by proving that all strategies with fixed two-outcome incoherent POVM must suffer error probability exceeding $ \exp\left( - O\left(\frac{NH_1}{2^n}\right)\right)$. This framework provides concrete design principles for overcoming sampling bottlenecks in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact non-Markovian master equations: a generalized derivation for quadratic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact master equation that captures the dynamics of a quadratic quantum system linearly coupled to a Gaussian environment. Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations. Remarkably, the master equation is written without employing field objects, path integrals, or involved superoperators. As a result, it shows an explicit and extremely compact dependence on the dressed environment correlation function: this allows us to state exactly how sequential virtual interactions between the system and the environment eventually lead to non-Markovian evolution. In the weak-coupling limit, this dependence facilitates a straightforward recovery of the well-known Redfield equation at second order in the coupling.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Based Quantum Strategies for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback-based quantum algorithms have recently emerged as potential methods for approximating the ground states of Hamiltonians. One such algorithm, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (FALQON), is specifically designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Its extension, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization with constraints (FALQON-C), was introduced to handle constrained optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. In this work, we extend the feedback-based quantum algorithms framework to address a broader class of constraints known as invalid configuration (IC) constraints, which explicitly prohibit specific configurations of decision variables. We first present a transformation technique that converts the constrained optimization problem with invalid configuration constraints into an equivalent unconstrained problem by incorporating a penalizing term into the cost function. Then, leaning upon control theory, we propose an alternative method tailored for feedback-based quantum algorithms that directly tackles IC constraints without requiring slack variables. Our approach introduces a new operator that encodes the optimal feasible solution of the constrained optimization problem as its ground state. Then, a controlled quantum system based on the Lyapunov control technique is designed to ensure convergence to the ground state of this operator. Two approaches are introduced in the design of this operator to address IC constraints: the folded spectrum approach and the deflation approach. These methods eliminate the need for slack variables, significantly reducing the quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits required. We show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Discovering highly efficient low-weight quantum error-correcting codes with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is expected to hinge on quantum error-correcting codes. In the quest for more efficient quantum fault tolerance, a critical code parameter is the weight of measurements that extract information about errors to enable error correction: as higher measurement weights require higher implementation costs and introduce more errors, it is important in code design to optimize measurement weight. This underlies the surging interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, the study of which has primarily focused on the asymptotic (large-code-limit) properties. In this work, we introduce a versatile and computationally efficient approach to stabilizer code weight reduction based on reinforcement learning (RL), which produces new low-weight codes that substantially outperform the state of the art in practically relevant parameter regimes, extending significantly beyond previously accessible small distances. For example, our approach demonstrates savings in physical qubit overhead compared to existing results by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for weight 6 codes and brings the overhead into a feasible range for near-future experiments. We also investigate the interplay between code parameters using our RL framework, offering new insights into the potential efficiency and power of practically viable coding strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate how RL can effectively advance the crucial yet challenging problem of quantum code discovery and thereby facilitate a faster path to the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced Monte Carlo simulation for photon interaction cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy physics simulations traditionally rely on classical Monte Carlo methods to model complex particle interactions, often incurring significant computational costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum-enhanced simulation framework that integrates discrete-time quantum walks with quantum amplitude estimation to model photon interaction cross sections. By mapping the probabilistic transport process of 10 MeV photons in a water medium onto a quantum circuit and focusing on Compton scattering as the dominant attenuation mechanism, we demonstrate that our approach reproduces classical probability distributions with high fidelity. Simulation results obtained via the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator reveal a quadratic speedup in amplitude estimation compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods. Our framework not only validates the feasibility of employing quantum algorithms for high-energy physics simulations but also offers a scalable pathway toward incorporating multiple interaction channels and secondary particle production. These findings underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced methods to overcome the computational bottlenecks inherent in large-scale particle physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal resource requirements for connected quantum sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a global quantum network capable of supporting secure communication and other quantum information processing (QIP) tasks hinges on the ability to distribute high-fidelity entanglement across long distances while optimizing resource usage. This work describes a scalable approach for building large quantum networks by connecting quantum sub-networks using entanglement backbones as interconnections and a swapping based entanglement distribution protocol. Using a statistical model for parametrized quantum sub-networks we derive a set of equations whose solutions give the optimal values of average network parameters that meet threshold requirements for QIP tasks while minimizing resource cost functions. Our analysis extends to the scenario where multiple sub-networks must be interconnected simultaneously based on the formulation of a global resource cost function. The probability of successfully satisfying the parameter thresholds of a QIP task as a function of average parameters of the sub-networks for random network demands reveals a transition from zero to full satisfiability above critical network parameter values. Moreover, we find that the satisfiability transition can be smooth or discontinuous depending on the topology of the sub-networks. Our results present a pathway for calculating optimal resource requirements in quantum sub-networks interconnected to form the global quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmian theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation. For this discrepancy to occur it is essential that positions at different times do not commute.</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian State Transfer on Vertex Complemented Coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{n_1}\}$ and a graph $H$ of order $n_2$, the vertex complemented corona, denoted by $G\tilde{\circ}{H}$, is the graph produced by copying $H$ $n_1$ times, with the $i$-th copy of $H$ corresponding to the vertex $v_i$, and then adding edges between any vertex in $V(G)\setminus\{v_{i}\}$ and any vertex of the $i$-th copy of $H$. The present article deals with quantum state transfer of vertex complemented coronae concerning signless Laplacian matrix. Our research investigates conditions in which signless Laplacian perfect state transfer exists or not on vertex complemented coronae. Additionally, we also provide some mild conditions for the class of graphs under consideration that allow signless Laplacian pretty good state transfer.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnected quantum devices are the building blocks of quantum networks, where state transduction plays a central role. The frequency conversion of photons into the telecommunication C-band is decisive in taking advantage of current low-loss transmission lines. Here, we report the difference frequency conversion of $637.2$ nm fluorescent light from a cluster of NV centers in diamond to tunable wavelengths between $1559.6$ nm and $1565.2$ nm. In order to avoid detrimental noise from spontaneous emissions, we use a two-step conversion device based on a single-pumped periodic poled lithium niobate waveguide. We observed a total external (internal) conversion efficiency of $3.0\pm0.1$ ($20.5\pm0.8$) $\%$ with a noise rate of $2.4\pm0.8$ ($16\pm5$) cps/GHz.</description>

      <title>Quantum computer formulation of the FKP-operator eigenvalue problem for probabilistic learning on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing formulation to address a challenging problem in the development of probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM). It involves solving the spectral problem of the high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FKP) operator, which remains beyond the reach of classical computing. Our ultimate goal is to develop an efficient approach for practical computations on quantum computers. For now, we focus on an adapted formulation tailored to quantum computing. The methodological aspects covered in this work include the construction of the FKP equation, where the invariant probability measure is derived from a training dataset, and the formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the FKP operator. The eigen equation is transformed into a Schr\"odinger equation with a potential V, a non-algebraic function that is neither simple nor a polynomial representation. To address this, we propose a methodology for constructing a multivariate polynomial approximation of V, leveraging polynomial chaos expansion within the Gaussian Sobolev space. This approach preserves the algebraic properties of the potential and adapts it for quantum algorithms. The quantum computing formulation employs a finite basis representation, incorporating second quantization with creation and annihilation operators. Explicit formulas for the Laplacian and potential are derived and mapped onto qubits using Pauli matrix expressions. Additionally, we outline the design of quantum circuits and the implementation of measurements to construct and observe specific quantum states. Information is extracted through quantum measurements, with eigenstates constructed and overlap measurements evaluated using universal quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk Analysis in Quantum Networks: Detection and Localization Insights with photon counting OTDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical crosstalk from sub-milliwatt classical-channel power into quantum channels presents a significant challenge in quantum network development, introducing substantial noise that limits the network's performance, scalability, and fidelity. Here we report the first demonstration using photon counting optical time-domain reflectometry ({\nu}-OTDR) to precisely identify and localize crosstalk between separate channels within the same fiber and between separate fibers. The coexistence of classical and quantum signals in the same network necessitates the use of optical switches for efficient routing and control. Crosstalk characterization of an optical switch reveals that crosstalk depends strongly on cross connect configuration, with higher levels observed when connections are presumed to be physically closer and lower levels when further apart. Additionally, we found that crosstalk exhibits a pronounced wavelength dependence, increasing over tenfold at longer wavelengths. These findings demonstrate the value of {\nu}-OTDR in diagnosing and mitigating crosstalk in quantum networks. They highlight the importance of optimizing optical switch configurations and wavelength management to minimize noise, ultimately enhancing the scalability, fidelity, and overall performance of quantum networks. This work establishes a foundational approach to addressing crosstalk, paving the way for more robust and efficient quantum network designs.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Quantum Simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories using gauge-invariant packaged quantum states \cite{Ma2017,Ma2025}. In this formalism, every single excitation transforms as a complete \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} of the local gauge group, preventing any appearance of fractional or partial \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)}. Multi-particle excitations can form nontrivial packaged entangled states that are also gauge invariant, thereby forbidding partial or fractional IQNs. In other words, all IQNs of such packaged entangled states remain inseparably entangled. This ``packaging principle'' ensures that physical states remain confined to the correct gauge sector and excludes partial charges or colors, even when multiple excitations are entangled.
  We illustrate this approach for $\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theories, discussing explicit constructions, Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution, and gauge-invariant measurements on a quantum simulator. We also outline how packaged states can mitigate gauge-violating errors and serve as natural building blocks for gauge-invariant coding schemes, while noting that standard quantum error correction is still required against typical local noise that respects gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Experimental randomness certification in a quantum network with independent sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness certification is a foundational and practical aspect of quantum information science, essential for securing quantum communication protocols. Traditionally, these protocols have been implemented and validated with a single entanglement source, as in the paradigmatic Bell scenario. However, advancing these protocols to support more complex configurations involving multiple entanglement sources is key to building robust architectures and realizing large-scale quantum networks. In this work, we show how to certify randomness in an entanglement-teleportation experiment, the building block of a quantum repeater displaying two independent sources of entanglement. Utilizing the scalar extension method, we address the challenge posed by the non-convexity of the correlation set, providing effective bounds on an eavesdropper's knowledge of the shared secret bits. Our theoretical model characterizes the certifiable randomness within the network and is validated through the analysis of experimental data from a photonic quantum network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin--Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work, we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states.

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian noise in randomized benchmarking of spin-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Markovian systems, the current state of the system depends on the full or partial history of its past evolution. Owing to these time correlations, non-Markovian noise violates common assumptions in gate characterization protocols such as randomized benchmarking and gate-set tomography. Here, we perform a case study of the effects of a quantum non-Markovian bath on qubit randomized benchmarking experiments. We consider a model consisting of qubits coupled to a multimode Bosonic bath. We apply unitary operations on the qubits, interspersed with brief interaction with the environment governed by a Hamiltonian. Allowing for non-Markovianity in the interactions leads to clear differences in the randomized benchmarking decay curves in this model, which we analyze in detail. The Markovian model's decay is exponential as expected whereas the model with non-Markovian interactions displays a much slower, almost polynomial, decay. We develop efficient numerical methods for this problem that we use to support our theoretical results. These results inform efforts on incorporating quantum non-Markovian noise in the characterization and benchmarking of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Broadband uniform-efficiency OAM-mode detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-dimensional basis of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has several added and unique advantages for photonics quantum technologies compared to the polarization basis, which is only two-dimensional. However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any prior information. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonics quantum technology efforts.</description>

      <title>Optimization Driven Quantum Circuit Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing a quantum circuit on specific hardware with a reduced available gate set is often associated with a substantial increase in the length of the equivalent circuit. This process is also known as transpilation and due to decoherence, it is mandatory to keep quantum circuits as short as possible, without affecting functionality. In this work we propose three different transpilation approaches, based on a localized term-replacement scheme, to substantially reduce circuit lengths while preserving the unitary operation implemented by the circuit. The first variant is based on a stochastic search scheme, and the other variants are driven by a database retrieval scheme and a machine learning based decision support. We show that our proposed methods generate short quantum circuits for restricted gate sets, superior to the typical results obtained by using different qiskit optimization levels. Our method can be applied to different gate sets and scales well with an arbitrary number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Cavity polariton blockade for non-local entangling gates with trapped atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for realizing multi-qubit entangled W-state and non-local $CZ$ and $C_2Z$ gates via a cavity polariton blockade mechanism with a system of atomic qubits coupled to a common cavity mode. The polariton blockade is achieved by tuning the system, an $N-$qubit register, such that no two atoms are simultaneously excited to the qubit excited state, and there is an effective coupling only between the ground state and a singly-excited W state of the qubit register. The control step requires only an external drive of the cavity mode and a global qubit pulse and no individual qubit addressing. We analytically obtain the state preparation error for an $N-$qubit W state which scales as $\sqrt{(1-1/N)}/\sqrt{C}$ where $C$ is the single particle cooperativity. We additionally show the application of the polariton blockade mechanism in realizing a non-local $CZ$ and $C_2Z$ gate by using a different set of computational qubit states, and characterize the gate errors which scale as $\sim 1/\sqrt{C}$.</description>

      <title>Interference and Measurement: Obtaining information from the QAOA MaxCut state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In using the QAOA algorithm for the MaxCut problem one encodes the number of edges connecting the sets resulting from a partition of the vertices of a graph into phases of amplitudes of a quantum state (QAOA state). One wants to use the quantum state to find partitions with large numbers of edges connecting them. In the QAOA algorithm this is done by using a mixing operation and parameter optimization. Here we want to see what can be done if we only use simple aspects of quantum mechanics, interference and measurement, to extract information from the QAOA state. The idea is to use constructive interference to enhance the amplitudes corresponding to partitions with a large number of edges between the sets. We examine examples, but analytically and numerically. We also show how the results of sequences of measurements can be used to gain information about the landscape of solutions.</description>

      <title>Noise Mitigation in Single Microwave Photon Counting by Cascaded Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While single-photon counting is routinely achieved in the optical domain, operational single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs) have only recently been demonstrated. SMPDs are critical for sensing weak signals from incoherent emitters, with applications ranging from the detection of individual electron spins and dark-matter candidates to advancements in hybrid quantum devices and superconducting quantum computing. These detectors offer a substantial advantage over quantum-limited amplification schemes by bypassing the standard quantum limit for power detection, therefore further reductions in their intrinsic noise are essential for advancing quantum sensing at microwave frequencies. Several SMPD designs utilize the state of a superconducting qubit to encode the detection of an itinerant photon, and rely on a non-destructive photon-qubit interaction. Here, we leverage this Quantum-Non-Demolition feature by repeatedly measuring the impinging photon with cascaded Four-Wave-Mixing processes and encoding the detection on several qubits. This cascaded detector mitigates the intrinsic local noise of individual qubits, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in intrinsic detector noise at the cost of halving the efficiency. We report an intrinsic sensitivity of $8(1)\times10^{-24}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with an operational sensitivity of $5.9(6)\times 10^{-23}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ limited by thermal photons in the input line.</description>

      <title>Passive Demultiplexed Two-photon State Generation from a Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary parameter ranges with a finite number of shots. While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. However, there are several sets of assumptions capturing the notions of prior ignorance and uninformed estimation, leading to two main approaches: invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, and adherence to the geometry of a state space. While the first approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive settings, the second can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. We examine the practical consequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. More importantly, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed - a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Syndrome Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device error rates on current quantum computers have improved enough to where demonstrations of error correction below break-even are now possible. Still, the circuits required for quantum error correction introduce significant overhead and sometimes inject more errors than they correct. In this work, we introduce adaptive syndrome extraction as a scheme to improve code performance and reduce the quantum error correction cycle time by measuring only the stabilizer generators that are likely to provide useful syndrome information. We provide a concrete example of the scheme through the [[4,2,2]] code concatenated with a hypergraph product code and a syndrome extraction cycle that uses quantum error detection to modify the syndrome extraction circuits in real time. Compared to non-concatenated codes and non-adaptive syndrome extraction, we find that the adaptive scheme achieves over an order of magnitude lower logical error rates while requiring fewer CNOT gates and physical qubits. Furthermore, we show how to achieve fault-tolerant universal logical computation with [[4,2,2]]-concatenated hypergraph product codes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing of Macroscopic Nuclear Spin Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezing has been explored in atomic systems as a tool for quantum sensing, improving experimental sensitivity beyond the spin standard quantum limit for certain measurements. To optimize absolute metrological sensitivity, it is beneficial to consider macroscopic spin ensembles, such as nuclear spins in solids and liquids. Coupling a macroscopic spin ensemble to a parametrically-modulated resonant circuit can create collective spin squeezing by generating spin correlations mediated by the circuit. We analyze the squeezing dynamics in the presence of decoherence and finite spin polarization, showing that achieving 7 dB spin squeezing is feasible in several nuclear spin systems. The metrological benefit of squeezing a macroscopic spin ensemble lies in the suppression of technical noise sources in the spin detection system relative to the spin projection noise. This expands the experimental sensitivity bandwidth when searching for signals of unknown frequency and can improve the resonant signal-to-noise ratio. Squeezing macroscopic spin ensembles may prove to be a useful technique for fundamental physics experiments aimed at detecting spin interactions with oscillating background fields, such as ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstrations of Josephson threshold detectors for broadband microwave photons detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-biased Josephson junctions (CBJJs) have been demonstrated as sensitive Josephson threshold detectors (JTDs) in the infrared range. In this letter, we show this kind of detector could also be used to detect broadband microwave photons. Based on the numerical simulations of the noise-driving phase dynamics of an underdamped Josephson junction, driven by the low-frequency triangular wave current, we argue that the microwave photons flowing across the JJ can be detected by probing the voltage switched signals of the JJ. Experimentally, we designed and fabricated the relevant Al/AlOx/Al Josephson device and measured its response to microwave photons at 50~mK temperature. Experimental results indicate that the weak microwave signals could be threatened as the additional noises modify the phase dynamics of the CBJJ, which could thus be detected by the generated JTD. The detection sensitivity is characterized by using the Kumar-Caroll index to differentiate the junction switched duration distributions, with and without microwave signal input. Although the demonstrated detection sensitivity is just $-92$~dBm (corresponding to approximately 30~photon/ns) for the microwave photons at $\sim 5$GHz (which is manifestly deviated from the plasma frequency of the fabricated JJ), we argued, based on the relevant numerical simulations, that the generated JTD could be used to achieve the sensitive detection of the microwave photons at the plasma frequency of the JJ.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. Standard regularization techniques modify high-energy behavior to ensure well-defined integrals. However, these approaches often introduce unphysical parameters, rely on arbitrary prescriptions, or break fundamental symmetries, making them mathematically effective but conceptually unsatisfactory.
  We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. Through curved momentum space, imposed by a geodesic metric, we construct an integral measure that inherently suppresses high-energy divergences while preserving fundamental symmetries, including full Lorentz invariance. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory
  Our approach guarantees the weakest possible suppression necessary for convergence, avoiding excessive modifications to quantum behavior, still achieving convergence. While formulated in Riemannian Geometry, we show seamless extension to Minkowski space, maintainining regularization properties in relativistic QFT. This offers an alternative to ad hoc renormalization, providing an intrinsic and mathematically well-motivated suppression mechanism, purely rooted in curved geometry of momentum space.
  We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. Beyond resolving divergences, this work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory, and potential extensions to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductance at superradiant phase transition in quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a few-body quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this work, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our work can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable few-body phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Provable Quantum Algorithm Advantage for Gaussian Process Quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop novel quantum algorithms for Gaussian process quadrature methods. Gaussian process quadratures are numerical integration methods where Gaussian processes are used as functional priors for the integrands to capture the uncertainty arising from the sparse function evaluations. Quantum computers have emerged as potential replacements for classical computers, offering exponential reductions in the computational complexity of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we combine Gaussian process quadratures and quantum computing by proposing a quantum low-rank Gaussian process quadrature method based on a Hilbert space approximation of the Gaussian process kernel and enhancing the quadrature using a quantum circuit. The method combines the quantum phase estimation algorithm with the quantum principal component analysis technique to extract information up to a desired rank. Then, Hadamard and SWAP tests are implemented to find the expected value and variance that determines the quadrature. We use numerical simulations of a quantum computer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical complexity analysis that shows a polynomial advantage over classical Gaussian process quadrature methods.

      <title>Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect led to the classification of materials as topological insulators, and the generalization of this classification to non-Hermitian band theory is an active area of research. While the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on Weyl Hamiltonians is expected to provide valuable insights for classifying topological phase transitions, predicting the effect of non-Hermiticity on Hall conductivity remains complex. In fact, previous theoretical work has shown that the quantization of Hall conductivity in the quantum anomalous Hall effect is lost, even though it is classified as a non-Hermitian Chern insulator. In this work, the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted tracking of magnetic objects using quantum diamond magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote magnetic sensing can be used to monitor the position of objects in real-time, enabling ground transport monitoring, underground infrastructure mapping and hazardous detection. However, magnetic signals are typically weak and complex, requiring sophisticated physical models to analyze them and a detailed knowledge of the system under study, factors that are frequently unavailable. In this work, we provide a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a Machine Learning (ML) method that can be trained exclusively on experimental data, without the need of any physical model, to predict the position of a magnetic target in real-time. The target can be any object with a magnetic signal above the floor noise, and in this case we use a quantum diamond magnetometer to track variations of few hundreds of nanoteslas produced by an elevator moving along a single axis. The one-dimensional movement is a simple yet challenging scenario, resembling realistic environments such as high buildings, tunnels or train circuits, and is the first step towards building broader applications. Our ML algorithm can be trained in approximately 40 min, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting the target's position at a rate of 10 Hz, for a positional error tolerance of 30 cm, which is a precise distance compared to the 4-meter spacing between parking levels. Our results open up the possibility to apply this ML method more generally for real-time monitoring of magnetic objects, which will broaden the scope of magnetic detection applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the Reed-Muller family by replacing the group $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Similar to the Reed-Muller codes, this class is closed under duality and has rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. We also construct quantum CSS codes arising from the Coxeter codes, which admit transversal logical operators outside of the Clifford group.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Universality of Rydberg-Excitation Spreading on a Dynamic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the universal properties of non-equilibrium phase transitions of spreading processes is a challenging problem. This applies in particular to irregular and dynamically varying networks. We here investigate an experimentally accessible model system for such processes, namely the absorbing-state phase transition (ASPT) of Rydberg-excitation spreading, known as Rydberg facilitation, in a laser-driven gas of mobile atoms. It occurs on an irregular graph, set by the random atom positions in the gas and, depending on temperature, changes its character from static to dynamic. By studying the behavior of the order parameter in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 173401 (2024)] we showed numerical evidence for a crossover from directed percolation (DP) universality through various phases of anomalous directed percolation (ADP) to mean-field (MF) behavior when the temperature of the gas is increased. As the behavior of the order parameter is not sufficient to uniquely determine the universality class, we here analyze the distribution of avalanches - characteristic of non-equilibrium critical behavior - to fully characterize the ASPT. Performing extended numerical calculations and experiments on a cold $^{87}$Rb atom gas we confirm our earlier numerical findings and our phenomenological model that maps the dynamic network to a static one with power-law tails of the distribution of excitation distances. Furthermore we discuss the influence of dissipation, present in the experiment and a necessary ingredient for the self-organization of the system to the critical point. In particular we study the potential modification of the universality class by losses as a function of dissipation strength.</description>

      <title>Micro Blossom: Accelerated Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching Decoding for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoding is important to quantum error correction decoding because of its accuracy. However, many believe that it is difficult, if possible at all, to achieve the microsecond latency requirement posed by superconducting qubits. This work presents the first publicly known MWPM decoder, called Micro Blossom, that achieves sub-microsecond decoding latency. Micro Blossom employs a heterogeneous architecture that carefully partitions a state-of-the-art MWPM decoder between software and a programmable accelerator with parallel processing units, one of each vertex/edge of the decoding graph. On a surface code with code distance $d$ and a circuit-level noise model with physical error rate $p$, Micro Blossom's accelerator employs $O(d^3)$ parallel processing units to reduce the worst-case latency from $O(d^{12})$ to $O(d^9)$ and reduce the average latency from $O(p d^3+1)$ to $O(p^2 d^2+1)$ when $p \ll 1$.
  We report a prototype implementation of Micro Blossom using FPGA. Measured at $d=13$ and $p=0.1\%$, the prototype achieves an average decoding latency of $0.8 \mu s$ at a moderate clock frequency of $62 MHz$. Micro Blossom is the first publicly known hardware-accelerated exact MWPM decoder, and the decoding latency of $0.8 \mu s$ is 8 times shorter than the best latency of MWPM decoder implementations reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy evolution during gravitational collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Our approach employs an Ermakov-like equation to determine the time-dependent ground state of the field and calculates the resulting entanglement entropy by tracing out the degrees of freedom inside a spherical region within the matter sphere. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits nontrivial scaling and time dependence during collapse. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling of entanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1\% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We describe methods to construct digital quantum simulation algorithms for quantum spin systems on a regular lattice with local interactions. In addition to tools such as the Trotter-Suzuki expansion and graph coloring, we also discuss the efficiency gained by parallel execution of an extensive number of commuting terms. We provide resource estimates and quantum circuit elements for the most important cases and classes of spin systems. As resource estimates we indicate the total number of gates $N$ and simulation time $T$, expressed in terms of the number $n$ of spin 1/2 lattice sites (qubits), target accuracy $\epsilon$, and simulated time $t$. We provide circuit constructions that realize the simulation time $T^{(1)}\propto nt^2/\epsilon$ and $T^{(2q)}\propto t^{1+\eta}n^\eta/\epsilon^\eta$ for arbitrarily small $\eta=1/2q$ for the first-order and higher-order Trotter expansions. We also discuss the potential impact of scaled gates, which have not yet been fully explored.</description>

Abstract: Lexicographically minimal string rotation is a fundamental problem in string processing that has recently garnered significant attention in quantum computing. Near-optimal quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, utilizing a divide-and-conquer structure. In this note, we show that its quantum query complexity is $\sqrt{n} \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$, improving the prior result of $\sqrt{n} \cdot 2^{(\log n)^{1/2+\varepsilon}}$ due to Akmal and Jin (SODA 2022). Notably, this improvement is quasi-polylogarithmic, which is achieved by only logarithmic level-wise optimization using fault-tolerant quantum minimum finding.</description>

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes is a class of convolutional LDPC codes that has been well investigated in classical coding theory thanks to their high performance and compatibility with low-latency decoders. We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</description>

      <title>Stability of classical shadows under gate-dependent noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expectation values of observables are routinely estimated using so-called classical shadows$\unicode{x2014}$the outcomes of randomized bases measurements on a repeatedly prepared quantum state. In order to trust the accuracy of shadow estimation in practice, it is crucial to understand the behavior of the estimators under realistic noise. In this work, we prove that any shadow estimation protocol involving Clifford unitaries is stable under gate-dependent noise for observables with bounded stabilizer norm$\unicode{x2014}$originally introduced in the context of simulating Clifford circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate with concrete examples that estimation of `magic` observables can lead to highly misleading results in the presence of miscalibration errors and a worst case bias scaling exponentially in the system size. We further find that so-called robust shadows, aiming at mitigating noise, can introduce a large bias in the presence of gate-dependent noise compared to unmitigated classical shadows. Nevertheless, we guarantee the functioning of robust shadows for a more general noise setting than in previous works. On a technical level, we identify average noise channels that affect shadow estimators and allow for a more fine-grained control of noise-induced biases.</description>

      <title>Squashed quantum non-Markovianity: a measure of genuine quantum non-Markovianity in states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$ and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.</description>

      <title>Secret extraction attacks against obfuscated IQP circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing devices can now perform sampling tasks which, according to complexity-theoretic and numerical evidence, are beyond the reach of classical computers. This raises the question of how one can efficiently verify that a quantum computer operating in this regime works as intended. In 2008, Shepherd and Bremner proposed a protocol in which a verifier constructs a unitary from the comparatively easy-to-implement family of so-called IQP circuits, and challenges a prover to execute it on a quantum computer. The challenge problem is designed to contain an obfuscated secret, which can be turned into a statistical test that accepts samples from a correct quantum implementation. It was conjectured that extracting the secret from the challenge problem is NP-hard, so that the ability to pass the test constitutes strong evidence that the prover possesses a quantum device and that it works as claimed. Unfortunately, about a decade later, Kahanamoku-Meyer found an efficient classical secret extraction attack. Bremner, Cheng, and Ji very recently followed up by constructing a wide-ranging generalization of the original protocol. Their IQP Stabilizer Scheme has been explicitly designed to circumvent the known weakness. They also suggested that the original construction can be made secure by adjusting the problem parameters. In this work, we develop a number of secret extraction attacks which are effective against both new approaches in a wide range of problem parameters. In particular, we find multiple ways to recover the 300-bit secret hidden in a challenge data set published by Bremner, Cheng, and Ji. The important problem of finding an efficient and reliable verification protocol for sampling-based proofs of quantum supremacy thus remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of quantum error correction codes and homomorphic encryption schemes is essential for achieving fault-tolerant secure cloud quantum computing. However, owing to the significant overheads associated with these schemes, their efficiency is paramount. In this study, we develop an efficient quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on quantum error correction codes that uses a single encoding process to simultaneously perform encryption and encoding. By using a longer quantum error correction code, both the security and error-correction capabilities of the scheme are improved. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more secure than the conventional permutation-key-based QHE scheme when the number of maximally mixed states is not more than twice the length of the quantum error-correction code. The proposed scheme offers a more secure and efficient approach to quantum cloud computing, potentially paving the way for more practical and scalable quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fascinating concept of coherent quantum absorber - which can absorb any photon emitted by another system while maintaining entanglement with that system - has found diverse implications in open quantum system theory and quantum metrology. This work generalizes the concept by proposing the so-called reversal conditions for the two systems, in which a "reverser" coherently reverses any effect of the other system on a field. The reversal conditions are rigorously boiled down to concise formulas involving the Petz recovery map and Kraus operators, thereby generalizing as well as streamlining the existing treatments of coherent absorbers.</description>

      <title>All You Need is pi: Quantum Computing with Hermitian Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal gate sets for quantum computation, when single and two qubit operations are accessible, include both Hermitian and non-Hermitian gates. Here we show that any single-qubit operator may be implemented as two Hermitian gates, and thus a purely Hermitian universal set is possible. This implementation can be used to prepare high fidelity single-qubit states in the presence of amplitude errors, and helps to achieve a high fidelity single-qubit gate decomposition using four Hermitian gates. An implementational convenience can be that non-identity single-qubit Hermitian gates are equivalent to $\pi$ rotations up to a global phase. We show that a gate set comprised of $\pi$ rotations about two fixed axes, along with the CNOT gate, is universal for quantum computation. Moreover, we show that two $\pi$ rotations can transform the axis of any multi-controlled unitary, a special case being a single CNOT sufficing for any controlled $\pi$ rotation. These gates simplify the process of circuit compilation in view of their Hermitian nature. We exemplify by designing efficient circuits for a variety of controlled gates, and achieving a CNOT count reduction for the four-controlled Toffoli gate in LNN-restricted qubit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in the symmetric subspace of $N$-partite $d$-dimensional systems (qudits). For diagonal symmetric states, we show that there is no bound entanglement for $d = 3,4 $ and $N = 3$. Further, we present a constructive algorithm to map multipartite diagonal symmetric states of qudits onto bipartite symmetric states of larger local dimension. This technique greatly simplifies the analysis of multipartite states and allows to infer entanglement properties for any even $N \geq 4 $ due to the fact that the PPT conditions that arise from the bipartite symmetric state correspond to the same PPT conditions that appear in the multipartite diagonal symmetric state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework that combines the adjoint-state method together with reverse-time backpropagation to solve prohibitively large open-system quantum control problems. Our approach enables the optimization of arbitrary cost functions with fully general controls applied on large open quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equation. It is scalable, computationally efficient, and has a low-memory footprint. We apply this framework to optimize two inherently dissipative operations in superconducting qubits which lag behind in terms of fidelity and duration compared to other unitary operations: the dispersive readout and all-microwave reset of a transmon qubit. Our results show that while standard pulses for dispersive readout are nearly optimal, adding a transmon drive during the protocol can yield 2x improvements in fidelity and duration. We further demonstrate a 2x improvement in reset fidelity and duration through pulse shaping, indicating significant potential for enhancement in reset protocols. Our approach can readily be applied to optimize quantum controls in a vast range of applications such as reservoir engineering, autonomous quantum error correction, and leakage-reduction units.</description>

Abstract: Landauer's limit on heat dissipation during information erasure is critical as devices shrink, requiring optimal pure-state preparation to minimise errors. However, Nernst's third law states this demands infinite resources in energy, time, or control complexity. We address the challenge of cooling quantum systems with finite resources. Using Markovian collision models, we explore resource trade-offs and present efficient cooling protocols (that are optimal for qubits) for coherent and incoherent control. Leveraging thermodynamic length, we derive bounds on heat dissipation for swap-based strategies and discuss the limitations of preparing pure states efficiently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with ${\Psi}^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement plays an indispensable role in numerous quantum information and quantum computation tasks, underscoring the need for efficiently verifying entangled states. In recent years, quantum state verification has received increasing attention, yet the challenge of addressing noise effects in implementing this approach remains unsolved. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the performance of quantum state verification protocols in the presence of measurement noise. Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, we propose a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Subsequently, using a noisy nonadaptive verification strategy of GHZ and stabilizer states, the noise effects on the verification efficiency are illustrated. From both analytical and numerical perspectives, we demonstrate that the noisy verification protocol exhibits a negative quadratic relationship between the sample complexity and the infidelity. Our method can be easily applied to real experimental settings, thereby demonstrating its promising prospects.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from strong converse exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deepen the study of properties of the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information, which is defined as the minimization of the sandwiched divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite state relative to any product state. In particular, we prove a novel duality relation for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$ by employing Sion's minimax theorem, and we prove additivity for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$. Previously, additivity was only known for $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$, but has been conjectured for $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$. Furthermore, we show that the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$ attains operational meaning in the context of binary quantum state discrimination as it is linked to certain strong converse exponents.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous adiabatic preparation of a quantum critical ground state in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction suppresses noise in quantum systems to allow for high-precision computations. In this work, we introduce Multivariate Bicycle (MB) Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes, via an extension of the framework developed by Bravyi et al. [Nature, 627, 778-782 (2024)] and particularly focus on Trivariate Bicycle (TB) codes. Unlike the weight-6 codes proposed in their study, we offer concrete examples of weight-5 TB-QLDPC codes which promise to be more amenable to near-term experimental setups. We show that TB-QLDPC codes up to weight-6 have a bi-planar structure and often posses a two-dimensional toric layout. Under circuit level noise, we find substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering similar error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode $4$ logical qubits with distance $5$ into $60$ physical qubits using weight-5 check measurements of circuit depth 7, while a surface code with these parameters requires $200$ physical qubits. The high encoding rate and compact layout make our codes highly suitable candidates for near-term hardware implementations, paving the way for a realizable quantum error correction protocol.</description>

      <title>Multi-controlled single-qubit unitary gates based on the quantum Fourier transform and deep decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will present a few new generalizations of the multi-controlled X (MCX) gate that uses the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Firstly, we will optimize QFT-MCX and prove that it is equivalent to a stair MCX gates array. This stair-wise structure will allow us to devise a method for adding an arbitrary phase factor to each qubit. The first MCX generalization into multi-controlled unitary gates (MCU) relies on replacing phase gates acting on the target qubit with controlled unitary gates. We will employ alternative single-qubit gate notation to minimize the complexities of these gates and show how to expand the circuit straightforwardly to the multi-controlled multi-target (MCMT) gate. The second generalization relies on the ZYZ-like decomposition. We will show that by extending one QFT-MCX circuit we implement the two multi-controlled X gates needed for the decomposition. Finally, we will split control wirelines into groups and use iterative ZYZ-like decomposition on QFT-MCU to obtain "deep decomposed" (DD) MCU which employs a lower number of C-NOTs than the previous two, thus making DD-MCU less prone to decoherence and noise. The supremacy of our implementations over the best-known optimized algorithm will be demonstrated by emulating noisy quantum calculations.</description>

      <title>Thermometry Based on a Superconducting Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report temperature measurements using a transmon qubit by detecting the population of its first three energy levels, after applying a sequence of $\pi$-pulses and performing projective dispersive readout. We measure the effective temperature of the qubit and characterize its relaxation and coherence times $\tau_{1,2}$ for three devices in the temperature range of $20-300$ mK. We analyze the process of qubit thermalization to its effective environment consisting of multiple heat baths and support it with experimental data. Signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the temperature measurement depends strongly on $\tau_1$, which drops at higher temperatures due to quasiparticle excitations, adversely affecting the measurements and setting an upper bound of the dynamic temperature range of the thermometer. The measurement relies on coherent dynamics of the qubit during the $\pi$-pulses. The effective qubit temperature follows closely that of the cryostat in the range of $100 - 250$ mK. We present a numerical model of the qubit population distribution and compare it favorably with the experimental results. Finally, we compare our technique with previous works on qubit thermometry and discuss its application prospects.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of surface phonons in a quantum acoustic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phononic resonators are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, both for applications in quantum computing, communication and sensing, as well as in experiments investigating fundamental physics. Here, we study the decoherence of phonons confined in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator strongly coupled ($g/2\pi\approx 9$ MHz) to a superconducting transmon qubit. By comparing experimental data with numerical solutions to the Markovian master equation, we report a surface phononic energy decay rate of $\kappa_1/2\pi=480$ kHz and a pure dephasing rate of $\kappa_{\phi}/2\pi=180$ kHz. These rates are in good agreement with the level of decoherence we extract from qubit-assisted spectroscopic measurements of the SAW resonator. We additionally find that the timescales over which coherent driven dynamics and decoherence occur are comparable, highlighting the need to model the composite device as an open quantum system. We discuss possible sources of decoherence in SAW-based quantum acoustic devices and the application of these devices in future quantum acoustic dissipation engineering experiments. The decoherence characterization techniques we employ are broadly applicable for investigating and benchmarking the effects of loss and dephasing on mechanical resonators in the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: We study Heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology in the viewpoint of population coding. Although Fisher information has been used for a figure of merit to characterize Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology, several studies pointed out it does not work as a figure of merit because it does not reflect the global structure. As an alternative figure of merit, we propose the mutual information, which connects the number of distinguishable elements of the parameter space in the viewpoint of population coding. We show that several unitary models achieve Heisenberg scaling in this context.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to Problem Sizes: An Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. However, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems, which will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based on superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum error correcting codes. The results emphasize that quantum error correction hardware has a substantial environmental impact due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. This paper can serve as a basis for designing more environmentally friendly quantum computers and for establishing their environmental profiles, as well as those of the human activities that will use them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

Abstract: We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut off factors commonly employed in the literature. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,$a.u. and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0.0,\,1.0]\,$a.u. is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</description>

Abstract: The fact that in the course of an open evolution there is, in a vast majority of cases, a creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherences, has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure dephasing interactions. Using completely general initials states, we derive a series of bounds on the amount of the created entanglement, connecting it to the initial system coherences as well as to the decohrence strength, making quantitatively precise the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence. Interestingly, we obtain lower bounds, certifying minimal amount of entanglement that can be produced. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing time evolution of the entanglement and the Markovian/non-Markovian crossover. Our results help to better understand and quantify the complicated correlations, produced during an open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better/new decoherence mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>All Hilbert spaces are the same: consequences for generalized coordinates and momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making use of the simple fact that all separable complex Hilbert spaces of given dimension are isomorphic, we show that there are just six basic ways to define generalized coordinate operators in Quantum Mechanics. In each case a canonically conjugate generalized momentum operator can be defined, but it may not be self-adjoint. Even in those cases we show there is always either a self-adjoint extension of the operator or a Neumark extension of the Hilbert space that produces a self-adjoint momentum operator. In one of the six cases both extensions work, thus leading to seven basic pairs of coordinate and momentum operators. We also show why there are more ways of defining basic coordinate and momentum measurements. A special role is reserved for measurements that simultaneously measure both.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Teleportation</title>

Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce entanglement when applied to a part of the resource state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result contributes to mitigating noise in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02813v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is a foundationally quantum approach to cosmology and gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems, which randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank {\it internal} symmetries. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. We show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of each subsystem with the rest of the Universe. We demonstrate that the states of subsystems depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A relative dynamics arises when an arbitrary subsystem is selected as a quantum clock with a time parameter. Thus, states of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters related to their $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and dynamics, plus discrete parameters characterizing their internal symmetries. We demonstrate the irrelevance of the geometry of this parameter space for observables. On the other hand, we use quantum speed limits to show that the perceived classical spacetime and its Lorentzian geometry emerge as an average path of subsystems in their Hilbert space. In this respect, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ fundamentally deviates from gauge-gravity duality models. Invariance under reparameterization restricts the action of subsystems dynamics to a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Consequently, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, the dynamics is perceived as the Einstein-Hilbert action. We briefly discuss $SU(\infty)-QGR$ specific models for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics was originally formulated to describe particles. Using ideas from the geometric quantization approach, we show how the concept of antiparticles can and should be introduced in the non-relativistic case without appealing to quantum field theory. We discuss this in detail using the example of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the prospect of the equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) $Without~a~boundary$: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) $With~a~reflecting~boundary$: In one scenario, the atom is uniformly accelerated, and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario, the atom is static, and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases, the atom interacts with the field modes, defined in the mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
