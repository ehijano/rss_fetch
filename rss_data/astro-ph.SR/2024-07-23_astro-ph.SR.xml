      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): I. a spectroscopic VLT monitoring survey of massive stars in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P &lt; 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity.
  The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5&lt;Teff/kK&lt;45 and 3.7&lt;log L/Lsun&lt;6.1 and initial masses 8&lt;Mini/Msun&lt;80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 324 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 309 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 137 late-type supergiants. At least 75 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 55 B-type (13% and 10% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes four high-mass X-ray binaries, three stars resembling luminous blue variables, two bloated stripped-star candidates, two candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>Abundances of neutron-capture elements in selected solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study is to accurately determine the abundances of Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce in selected solar-type stars. This will allow us to establish observational abundance-metallicity and abundance-age relations and to explore the reasons for the excess of Ba compared to other s-elements in younger solar-type stars. We analysed HARPS spectra of main-sequence solar-type FGK stars with metallicities from -0.15 to +0.35 dex and ages from 2 to 14 Gyr using 1D LTE synthesis and MARCS atmospheric models. In the procedure of fitting synthetic to observed line profiles, the free parameters included abundance and microturbulent and macroturbulent velocity. The macroturbulent velocity can substantially compensate for NLTE effects in the line core. We find that the abundance [X/H] increases with metallicity and age. The ratio of the abundances of s-process elements [s/Fe] increases with decreasing metallicity and age, while the [Cu/Fe] ratio increases with both metallicity and age. These observed trends agree well with published observational data and with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. A small [Ba/Fe] enhancement of 0.08 +/- 0.08 dex has been detected in seven younger stars with an average age of 2.8 +/- 0.6 Gyr. Compared to the abundances of other s-process elements, [Ba/Fe] is 0.07 and 0.08 dex higher than La and Ce on average, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the [Ba/Fe] ratio increases with increasing chromospheric activity. The average [Ba/Fe] for the three most active stars is 0.15 +/- 0.10 dex higher than that of the other stars. Chromospheric activity can significantly alter the physical conditions in the formation layers of the Ba lines. Our primary conclusion is that to account for the observed excess of [Ba/Fe] abundance in younger stars, it is essential to use more complex atmospheric models that incorporate magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Statistics on Magnetic Properties at the Footpoints of Erupting Magnetic Flux Ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is under debate whether the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere carries neutralized electric currents; particularly, whether a magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is considered the core structure of coronal mass ejections, carries neutralized electric currents. Recently Wang et al. (2023, ApJ, 943, 80) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28 eruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous statistics has been done. Here, we include 9 more events from 2016 to 2023 and perform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of 5\%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic properties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the method of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests demonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with pre-eruption dimming and those with only post-eruption dimming. However, there is a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current and those produce pre-eruption dimming, which can be understood by the Lorentz-self force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in estimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>CORINOS II. JWST-MIRI detection of warm molecular gas from an embedded, disk-bearing protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H$_2$O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 $\mu$m, whereas the H$_2$O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6-8 $\mu$m. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir of $1551\pm135$ K, while the water is much cooler at $212\pm 2$ K. Neither the CO nor the H$_2$O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within $\sim$40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically-resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Shell mergers in the late stages of massive star evolution: new insight from 3D hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models are widely used across various astrophysical fields, however they are still dominated by important uncertainties that deeply affect their predictive power. Among those, the merging of independent convective regions is a poorly understood phenomenon predicted by some 1D models but whose occurrence and impact in real stars remain very uncertain. Being an intrinsically multi-D phenomenon, it is challenging to predict the exact behaviour of shell mergers with 1D models. In this work, we conduct a detailed investigation of a multiple shell merging event in a 20 M$_\odot$ star using 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Making use of the active tracers for composition and the nuclear network included in the 3D model, we study the merging not only from a dynamical standpoint but also considering its nucleosynthesis and energy generation. Our simulations confirm the occurrence of the merging also in 3D, but reveal significant differences from the 1D case. Specifically, we identify entrainment and the erosion of stable regions as the main mechanisms that drive the merging, we predict much faster convective velocities compared to the mixing-length-theory velocities, and observe multiple burning phases within the same merged shell, with important effects for the chemical composition of the star, which presents a strongly asymmetric (dipolar) distribution. We expect that these differences will have important effects on the final structure of massive stars and thus their final collapse dynamics and possible supernova explosion, subsequently affecting the resulting nucleosynthesis and remnant.</description>

      <title>Imprint of the magnetic activity cycle on solar asteroseismic characterisation based on 26 years of GOLF and BiSON data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the success of previous missions, asteroseismic modelling will play a key role in future space-based missions, such as PLATO, CubeSpec, and Roman. Despite remarkable achievements, asteroseismology has revealed significant discrepancies in the physics of theoretical stellar models, which have the potential to bias stellar characterisation at the precision level demanded by PLATO. The current modelling strategies largely overlook magnetic activity, assuming that its effects are masked by filtering the so-called surface effects. Given the presence of activity cycles in multiple solar-like oscillators, and activity variations in a significant fraction of Kepler observations of main-sequence stars (Santos et al. 2019b, 2021, 2023), we measured the impact of magnetic activity on the asteroseismic characterisation of the Sun based on 26.5 years of GOLF and BiSON observations. While magnetic activity is partially absorbed in the treatment of surface effects, we found a discernible imprint of the activity cycle in the determination of the solar age. Notably, this imprint persists across both BiSON and GOLF datasets, with significant variations of up to 6.5% observed between solar minima and maxima. Considering that the Sun exhibits low levels of activity, our study underscores the looming challenge posed by magnetic activity for future photometry missions, and prompts a potential reevaluation of the asteroseismic characterisation of Kepler's most active targets.</description>

      <title>Early-Time Observations of SN 2023wrk: A Luminous Type Ia Supernova with Significant Unburned Carbon in the Outer Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II $\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at $t \approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 {\AA} and 5300 {\AA} in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C II $\lambda6580$ absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C II to Si II and the B-V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing $^{56}$Ni.</description>

      <title>Star-Disk Collisions: Implications for QPEs and Other Transients Near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star-accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the debris' orbital properties. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass-loss per collision; the mass-loss is much larger after repeated collisions due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass-loss in star-disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ~100 years; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star-disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (`circularization shocks'). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.</description>

      <title>Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light Echoes and 3D Dust Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and Tycho's SN in nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\pm0.1$ kpc and $3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars. Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the intervening H I column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Milky Way dust extinction curve in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar dust is a major foreground contaminant for many observations and a key component in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, yet its properties remain highly uncertain. Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure the extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million stars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map its variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented detail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain growth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher densities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming regions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds, or by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.</description>

      <title>Radioactive Gamma-Ray Lines from Long-lived Neutron Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of a kilonova AT2017gfo associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817 provides the first strong evidence that neutron star mergers are dominant contributors to the production of heavy $r$-process elements. Radioactive gamma-ray lines emitted from neutron star merger remnants provide a unique probe for investigating the nuclide composition and tracking its evolution. In this work, we studied the gamma-ray line features arising from the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei in the merger remnants based on the $r$-process nuclear reaction network and the astrophysical inputs derived from numerical relativity simulations. The decay chain of $^{126}_{50}$Sn ($T_{1/2}=230$ kyr) $\to$ $^{126}_{51}$Sb ($T_{1/2}=12.35$ days) $\to$ $^{126}_{52}$Te (stable) produces several bright gamma-ray lines with energies of $415$, $667$, and $695$ keV, making it the most promising decay chain during the remnant phase. The photon fluxes of these bright gamma-ray lines reach $\sim10^{-5}$ $\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for Galactic merger remnants with ages less than $100$~kyr, which can be detected by the high energy resolution MeV gamma-ray detectors like the MASS mission.</description>

      <title>Inner dusty regions of protoplanetary discs -- III. The role of non-radial radiation pressure in dust dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore dynamical behaviour of dust particles that populate the surface of inner optically thick protoplanetary discs. This is a disc region with the hottest dust and of a great importance for planet formation and dust evolution, but we still struggle to understand all the forces that shape this environment. In our approach we combine results from two separate numerical studies - one is the wind velocity and density distributions obtained from magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs, and the other is a high-resolution multigrain dust radiation transfer. In our previous paper in the series, we described the methodology for utilising these results as an environmental input for the integration of dust trajectories driven by gravity, gas drag, and radiation pressure. Now we have two improvements - we incorporate time changes in the wind density and velocity, and we implement the non-radial radiation pressure force. We applied our analysis on Herbig Ae and T Tau stars. We confirm that the radiation pressure force can lead to dust outflow, especially in the case of more luminous stars. Additionally, it opposes dust accretion at the inner disc edge and reduces dust settling. These effects are enhanced by the disc wind, especially in the zone where the stellar and the disc magnetic fields meet. Our results suggest that dust grains can stay in the hottest disc region for an extended period and then can end up ejected into the outer disc regions.</description>

      <title>Statistics and Habitability of F-type Star--Planet Systems</title>

Abstract: F-type star--planet systems represent an intriguing case for habitability studies. Although F-type stars spend considerably less time on the main-sequence than G, K, and M-type stars, they still offer a unique set of features, allowing for the principal possibility of exolife. Examples of the latter include the increased widths of stellar habitable zones as well as the presence of enhanced UV flux, which in moderation may have added to the origin of life in the Universe. In this study, we pursue a detailed statistical analysis of the currently known planet-hosting F-type stars by making use of the NASA Exoplanet Archive. After disregarding systems with little or no information on the planet(s), we identify 206 systems of interest. We also evaluate whether the stars are on the main-sequence based on various criteria. In one approach, we use the stellar evolution code MESA. Depending on the adopted criterion, about 60 to 80 stars have been identified as main-sequence stars. In 18 systems, the planet spends at least part of its orbit within the stellar habitable zone. In one case, i.e., HD 111998, commonly known as 38 Vir, the planet is situated in the habitable zone at all times. Our work may serve as a basis for future studies, including studies on the existence of Earth-mass planets in F-type systems, as well as investigations of possibly habitable exomoons hosted by exo-Jupiters as the lowest-mass habitable zone planet currently identified has a mass estimate of 143 Earth masses.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Stellar Flare Models of Deep Atmospheric Heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical flares have been observed from magnetically active stars for many decades; unsurprisingly, the spectra and temporal evolution are complicated. For example, the shortcomings of optically thin, static slab models have long been recognized when confronted with the observations. A less incorrect -- but equally simple -- phenomenological $T \approx 9000$ K blackbody model has instead been widely adopted in the absence of realistic (i.e., observationally-tested) time-dependent, atmospheric models that are readily available. We use the RADYN code to calculate a grid of 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models that are driven by short pulses of electron-beam heating. The flare heating rates in the low atmosphere vary over many orders of magnitude in the grid, and we show that the models with high-energy electron beams compare well to the global trends in flux ratios from impulsive-phase stellar flare, optical spectra. The models also match detailed spectral line shape properties. We find that the pressure broadening and optical depths account for the broad components of the hydrogen Balmer $\gamma$ lines in a powerful flare with echelle spectra. The self-consistent formation of the wings and nearby continuum level provide insight into how high-energy electron beam heating evolves from the impulsive to the gradual decay phase in white-light stellar flares. The grid is publicly available, and we discuss possible applications.</description>

      <title>No longer impossible: the self-lensing binary KIC 8145411 is a triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with data from the \textit{Kepler} mission. One of these systems is KIC 8145411, which was reported to host an extremely low mass (ELM; $0.2\,M_{\odot}$) white dwarf (WD) in a 456-day orbit with a solar-type companion. The system has been dubbed "impossible", because evolutionary models predict that $\sim 0.2\,M_{\odot}$ WDs should only be found in tight orbits ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim$ days). In this work, we show that KIC 8145411 is in fact a hierarchical triple system: it contains a WD orbiting a solar-type star, with another solar-type star $\sim 700\,$AU away. The wide companion was unresolved in the Kepler light curves, was just barely resolved in Gaia DR3, and is resolved beyond any doubt by high-resolution imaging. We show that the presence of this tertiary confounded previous mass measurements of the WD for two reason: it dilutes the amplitude of the self-lensing pulses, and it reduces the apparent radial velocity (RV) variability amplitude of the WD's companion due to line blending. By jointly fitting the system's light curves, RVs, and multi-band photometry using a model with two luminous stars, we obtain a revised WD mass of $(0.53 \pm 0.01)\,M_{\odot}$. Both luminous stars are near the end of their main-sequence evolution. The WD is thus not an ELM WD, and the system does not suffer the previously proposed challenges to its formation history. Similar to the other SLBs and the population of astrometric WD binaries recently identified from Gaia data, KIC 8145411 has parameters in tension with standard expectations for formation through both stable and unstable mass transfer. The system's properties are likely best understood as a result of unstable mass transfer from an AGB star donor.</description>

      <title>Energetic Electrons Accelerated and Trapped in a Magnetic Bottle above a Solar Flare Arcade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a "magnetic bottle" structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing down plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides above the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Study of on-disk Coronal Hole Jets with IRIS and SDO observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar jets are an important field of study, as they may contribute to the mass and energy transfer from the lower to the upper atmosphere. We use the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) observations to study two small-scale jets originating in the same on-disk coronal hole observed in October 2013. We combine dopplergrams, intensity maps, and line width maps derived from IRIS Si IV 1393.755{\AA} spectra along with images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO to describe the dynamics of the jets. Images from AIA, with the use of the emission measure loci technique and rectangular differential emission measure (DEM) distributions, provide estimations of the plasma temperatures. We used the O \textsc{IV} 1399.77 \AA, 1401.16~\AA\ spectral lines from IRIS to derive electron densities. For jet 1, the SDO images show a small mini-filament 2 minutes before the jet eruption, while jet 2 originates at a pre-existing coronal bright point. The analysis of asymmetric spectral profiles of the Si \textsc{IV} 1393.755~\AA\ and 1402.770~\AA\ lines reveals the existence of two spectral components with inversely dependant 1393.755~\AA/1402.770~\AA\ ratios at both regions. One of the components can be related to the background plasma emission originating outside the jet, while the secondary component represents higher-energy plasma flows associated with the jets. Both jets exhibit high densities of the order of 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ at their base and 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the spire, respectively, as well as similar average nonthermal velocities of $\sim$ 50-60 km/s. However, the two jets show differences in their length, duration, and plane-of-sky velocity. Finally, the DEM analysis reveals that both jets exhibit multithermal distributions.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flux limits from brown dwarfs: Implications for dark matter annihilating into long-lived mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) are celestial objects representing the link between the least massive main-sequence stars and giant gas planets. In the first part of this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM particles eventually thermalise, and can annihilate into light, long-lived, mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework, the current Fermi-LAT stacked upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the selected BDs do not enable setting a bound on the DM-nucleon cross-section. An improvement of approximately a factor of 9 in the gamma-ray limits is required to obtain bounds on the scattering cross-section $\sigma_{\chi n}$ $\sim 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. This improvement would cover a larger portion of the parameter space in mediator decay length and DM mass. The code and data to reproduce the results of this study are available on GitLab at \github{https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/francesca.calore/brown-dwarfs-gamma}.</description>

      <title>The High resolution Fe K Spectrum of Cygnus X-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze features of the Fe K spectrum of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. The spectrum was obtained with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer in the third diffraction order. The increased energy resolution of the third order enables us to fully resolve the Fe XXV He{\alpha} complex and the Fe XXVI Ly{\alpha} lines. The emission-line spectrum shows the expected features of photoionization equilibrium, excited in the dense stellar wind of the companion star. We detect discrete emission from inner-shell transitions, in addition to absorption likely due to multiple unresolved transitions in lower ionization states. The emission-line intensity ratios observed in the range of the spectrum occupied by the Fe XXV n = 1-2 forbidden and intercombination lines suggest that there is a substantial contribution from resonantly scattered inner-shell emission from the Li- and Be-like ionization states. The Fe XXV forbidden and intercombination lines arise in the ionization zone closest to the compact object, and since they are not subject to radiative-transfer effects, we can use them in principle to constrain the radial velocity amplitude of the compact object. We infer that the results indicate a compact object mass of the order of the mass of the Wolf-Rayet companion star, but we note that the presence of resonantly scattered radiation from Li-like ions may complicate the interpretation of the He-like emission spectrum, and specifically of the radial velocity curve of the Fe XXV forbidden line.</description>

      <title>Cluster Population Demographics in NGC 628 Derived from Stochastic Population Synthesis Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical properties of star cluster populations offer valuable insights into their birth, evolution, and disruption. However, individual stars in clusters beyond the nearest neighbours of the Milky Way are unresolved, forcing analyses of star cluster demographics to rely on integrated light, a process fraught with uncertainty. Here we infer the demographics of the cluster population in the benchmark galaxy NGC 628 using data from the Legacy Extra-galactic UV Survey (LEGUS) coupled to a novel Bayesian forward-modelling technique. Our method analyzes all 1178 clusters in the LEGUS catalogue, $\sim4$ times more than prior studies severely affected by completeness cuts. Our results indicate that the cluster mass function is either significantly steeper than the commonly-observed slope of $-2$ or is truncated at $\approx 10^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$; the latter possibility is consistent with proposed relations between truncation mass and star formation surface density. We find that cluster disruption is relatively mild for the first $\approx 200$ Myr of cluster evolution; no evidence for mass-dependent disruption is found. We find suggestive but not incontrovertible evidence that inner galaxy clusters may be more prone to disruption and outer galaxy clusters have a more truncated mass function, but confirming or refuting these findings will require larger samples from future observations of outer galaxy clusters. Finally, we find that current stellar track and atmosphere models, along with common forms for cluster mass and age distributions, cannot fully capture all features in the multidimensional photometric distribution of star clusters. While our forward-modelling approach outperforms earlier backward-modeling approaches, some systematic differences persist between observed and modelled photometric distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a study of the equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic stars in the framework of general relativity. For that purpose, we provide the equations of structure where the rotation is treated to second order in the angular velocity. These equations extend those first derived by Hartle for slowly rotating isotropic stars. As an application of the new formalism, we study the rotational properties of Bowers-Liang fluid spheres. A result of particular interest is that the ellipticity and mass quadrupole moment are negative for certain highly anisotropic configurations; thus, such systems are prolate rather than oblate. Furthermore, for configurations with high anisotropy and compactness close to their critical value, quantities like the moment of inertia, change of mass, and mass quadrupole moment approach to the corresponding Kerr black hole values, similar to other ultracompact systems like sub-Buchdahl Schwarzschild stars and analytic rotating gravastars.</description>

      <title>Flux rope modeling of the 2022 Sep 5 CME observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter from 0.07 to 0.69 au</title>

Abstract: As both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) reach heliocentric distances closer to the Sun, they present an exciting opportunity to study the structure of CMEs in the inner heliosphere. We present an analysis of the global flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP at a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in situ measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion measures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with heliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope size. We use PSP/WISPR images as input to the ELEvoHI model, providing a direct link between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy between the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying model assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the Sun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger heliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO/MAG and PSP/FIELDS data independently with the 3DCORE model and find that many parameters are consistent between spacecraft, however, challenges are apparent when reconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and Solar Orbiter, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations between spacecraft. From our model results, it is clear the solar wind background speed and drag regime strongly affect the modeled expansion and propagation of CMEs and need to be taken into consideration.</description>

Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN 2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times 10^{-3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Regularization of Parker Sonic Critical Point in Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This development recognizes the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This task is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>
