      <title>Twists and Gorms and Antifields, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I define topological twists of supersymmetric field theories in the case when the supercharges involved obey an ``open'' algebra. Using the Batalin--Vilkovisky field--antifield formalism, I construct twisted theories algorithmically from the supersymmetry data, and explain supersymmetric localisation in terms of anticanonical transformations. I also treat equivariant topological twists and explain how BV observables contain the equivariant cohomology of the space of histories. Some results are generalised to theories with two topological supercharges -- such as the ``balanced'' topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Moore -- using the geometry of ``differential gorms'' of Kochan and \v{S}evera. Finally, I exhibit examples of these constructions, including a $\mathrm{U}(1)$-equivariant topological B-model.</description>

      <title>Every Wrinkle Carries A Memory: An Integro-differential Bootstrap for Features in Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological observations, we push the cosmological bootstrap program beyond the de Sitter invariance lamppost by considering correlators that explicitly break scale invariance, thereby exhibiting primordial features. For exchange processes involving heavy fields with time-dependent masses and sound speeds, we demonstrate that locality in the bulk implies a set of integro-differential equations for correlators on the boundary. These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations. Meanwhile, we also unveil non-perturbative information in the integro-differential equations by resumming apparent infrared divergences as parametric resonances. In addition, we provide a first-of-its-kind example of numerical bootstrap that directly maps out the solution space of such boundary equations. Finally, we compute the bispectrum and uncover, in the squeezed limit, a scale-breaking cosmological collider signal, whose amplitude can be exponentially enhanced (with respect to the Boltzmann suppression) due to particle production triggered by high-frequency mass oscillations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field in vacuum of quantum spinor matter induced by a cosmic string in three-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear magnetic topological defect (cosmic string) is modeled as a magnetic flux-carrying tube that is impenetrable to external spinor matter. The matter field is quantized in the background of this tube, with the most general set of boundary conditions ensuring both the tube's impenetrability and the self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian operator. We compute the induced vacuum magnetic flux along the tube in (3+1)-dimensional space-time. It was shown that the requirement for the total induced vacuum magnetic flux to be finite restricts the admissible boundary conditions to only one choice: the MIT quark bag boundary condition. The dependence of the effect on the transverse size of the tube and the flux inside the tube was also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Transmission Coefficients from Phantom Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A representative quantity that characterizes the dynamics of conformal interfaces is the transmission coefficient, which is defined through correlation functions of the stress tensor. Typically, this coefficient is complicated and highly dependent on its details. In this work, we introduce a new perspective based on the notion of a ``phantom current''. We have shown that a spin-2 phantom current arising from the folding trick completely determines the transmission coefficient. In particular, when there is a single phantom current, the transmission coefficient is uniquely fixed by its conformal dimension. As a result, our framework provides a unified explanation of known results in minimal models and the free boson, while also yielding concrete predictions for previously unexplored interfaces.</description>

      <title>Conformal Bootstrap with Duality-Inspired Fusion Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic exploration of conformal field theories (CFTs) possessing fusion rules inspired by categorical (non-invertible) symmetries, using the conformal bootstrap. Specifically, we impose a selection rule motivated by Kramers-Wannier duality and derive bounds on the conformal dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon)$ of the lowest-lying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even scalar $\epsilon$ in dimensions $d=2$ through $d=7$. Our bounds correctly allow the $d=2$ Ising model while excluding the $d=3$ Ising model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed condition. Furthermore, we observe a distinct feature in $d=2$ corresponding to the $\mathcal{M}(8,7)$ minimal model and find non-trivial constraints in $d=3$ ($\Delta_\sigma \gtrsim 0.85$), relevant for theories like QED$_3$. This work opens a new avenue for non-perturbatively probing the vast landscape of CFTs constrained by non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>An algebra for covariant observers in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent implementation of the gravitational constraints in de Sitter space requires gauging the full $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this paper, we develop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry while consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We achieve this by introducing the concept of \textit{covariant observer}, whose geodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon quantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a quantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem, we propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of freedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes and other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an averaged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its type II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the algebraic and generalized entropies are in match.
  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a \textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all possible static patches and configurations of other geodesics. This provides a complete, covariant, and multi-observer extension of the CLPW construction and lays the foundation for a fully relational quantum gravitational description of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Weyl double copy in Lifshitz spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifshitz black hole solutions pose particular challenges for reconciling the two main formulations of the classical double copy: the Kerr-Schild double copy and the Weyl double copy. Recent work has suggested that consistency between the two can be restored, in certain cases, only by adopting a regularization prescription in the Weyl double copy. In this paper, we test this prescription on three examples from the literature, each with a distinct novel feature, and show that the prescription remains valid in all cases.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Quantum Gravity and Finite $N$ Chiral Primaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory on AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$ $\times$ $\mathcal{M}_4$ provides a well-studied realization of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holography, but its non-perturbative structure at finite $N \sim 1/G_N^{(3)}$ is largely unknown. A long-standing puzzle concerns the stringy exclusion principle: what bulk mechanism can reproduce the boundary expectation that the chiral primary Hilbert space of the symmetric orbifold contains only a finite number of states at finite $N$? In this work, we present a bulk prescription for computing the finite $N$ spectrum of chiral primary states in symmetric orbifolds of $\mathbb{T}^4$ or K3. We show that the integer spectrum at any $N$ is reproduced exactly by summing over one-loop supersymmetric partition functions of the IIB theory on (AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$)/$\mathbb{Z}_k$ $\times$ $\mathcal{M}_4$ orbifolds and their spectral flows. Using the worldsheet in the tensionless limit, we verify that the terms appearing in our proposal coincide with the partition functions of these orbifold geometries and their asymmetric generalizations. These partition functions contribute with alternating signs due to BPS modes with negative conformal dimensions and charges in twisted sectors. The resulting alternating sum collapses via large cancellations to the finite $N$ polynomials observed in symmetric orbifold CFTs, providing a bulk explanation of the stringy exclusion principle. We identify different Stokes sectors where different infinite subsets of these geometries contribute to the path integral, and propose a classification as functions of the chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy for nonlocal field theories displays a universal ``volume law" scaling \cite{Barbon:2008ut, Karczmarek:2013xxa, Shiba:2013jja, Pang:2014tpa} as opposed to the ``area law" scaling for local field theories. The aim of this work is to determine whether complexity displays any such an universal scaling laws. The field theories considered here are obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory by higher dimension operators introducing nonlocality, namely a dipole deformation and noncommutativity (NCSYM) by turning on world volume Kalb-Ramond $B$ field. The dual gravity backgrounds have a running dilaton, in addition to the $B$-field background, which alter AdS asymptotics. Our results capture nonlocality in the hyperscaling behavior for complexity. We also compute the subregion complexity which display phase transitions in the nonlocal field theories with the transition point being the same as that for the phase transition of entanglement entropy \cite{Karczmarek:2013xxa}. These new results dovetail nicely with our findings from our previous works \cite{Chakraborty:2020fpt, Katoch:2022hdf, Bhattacharyya:2022ren} on other lower dimensional nonlocal field theories such as little string theories (LSTs) and warped conformal field theories (WCFTs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model with a single $U(N)$ adjoint fermionic matrix. The model is exactly solvable yet contains a large number of fortuitous states. We investigate these states exactly at finite $N$ and, in the large $N$ limit, via a unitary matrix model. In particular, we develop a way to "follow $N$" in the unitary matrix integral and study how the answer of the integral depends sensitively on the value of $N$.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry-resolved genuine multi-entropy, a measure that captures genuine multi-partite entanglement, in Haar random states and random graph states in the presence of a conserved quantity. For Haar random states, we derive explicit formulae for the genuine multi-entropy under a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic limit, and find that its dependence on subsystem sizes closely resembles that of fully Haar random states without a conserved charge. We also perform numerical analyses, focusing on spin systems for both Haar random and graph states. For random graph states, our numerical analyses reveal distinctive features of their multi-partite entanglement structure and we contrast them with the Haar random case.</description>

      <title>Black holes and dualities in string theory compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis addresses three problems arising in type II string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. In the first one we study the hypermultiplet moduli space (HM), by working on its twistor space. Using data derived via mirror symmetry and S-duality, we compute NS5-instanton corrections to the HM metric in the one-instanton approximation.
  These corrections are weighted by D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, which coincide with rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants and count the (signed) number of BPS black hole microstates. These invariants exhibit wall-crossing behavior and induce a Riemann-Hilbert problem. This problem can describe many setups, including the D-instanton corrected twistor space of the HM in type II string theory and is of independent mathematical interest. We consider a quantum deformation of the RH problem, induced by the refined BPS indices. Using a formulation of the problem in terms of a non-commutative Moyal star product, we provide a perturbative solution to it. From the adjoint form of this solution, we identify a generating function for coordinates on the still mysterious quantum analog of the twistor space.
  Finally, we study the modular properties of the D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, more precisely of their generating functions. It was previously argued, using S-duality, that the generating functions are higher depth mock modular forms. Moreover, they satisfy a modular completion equation, which fixes their shadow in terms of other (lower rank) generating functions. We start by bringing about a significant simplification to these equations and recovering subtle contributions that were overlooked. Then, we provide (a recipe for) solutions to these modular completion equations, up to all the holomorphic modular ambiguities that need to be fixed independently.For this, we use indefinite generalized theta series and Jacobi-like forms to write the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is aimed at improving thermal bootstrapping methods for matrix quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The thermal energies of the large-N one-matrix anharmonic oscillator and large-N two-matrix anharmonic oscillator were bounded without logarithmic relaxation using the Quantum Information Conic Solver. For the one-matrix anharmonic oscillator, dual to a theory of "long strings", stricter bounds yielded a value of the first long string excited energy within 0.001% of the physical value and the first estimation from symmetry and self-consistency equations alone of the first long string coupling coefficient.</description>

      <title>Wiggling boundary and corner edge modes in JT gravity with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge modes (GrEMs) and gauge edge modes (GaEMs) in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity on a wiggling boundary. The wiggling effect manifests as a series of spacetime topological and bulk constraints for both conical and wormhole defect solutions. For the conical defect solution, we employ the generalized Fefferman-Graham (F-G) gauge to extend the boundary action, allowing for non-constant temperature and horizon position. We find that the infrared behavior of this boundary action is determined by the local dynamics of the temperature and horizon. For the wormhole defect solution, the boundary action can, in special cases, be described by a field with variable mass subject to a constant external force. We classify this corner system as a first-class constrained system influenced by field decomposition, confirming that the physical degrees of freedom are determined by constraints from the wiggling boundary information. We find that GrEMs and GaEMs can be linked at the corners by imposing additional constraints. Additionally, we show that the ``parallelogram'' composed of corner variables exhibits discreteness under a unitary representation. Finally, we explore that information from extrinsic vectors can be packaged into the GaEMs via a Maurer-Cartan form, revealing the boundary degrees of freedom as two copies of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. By separating pure gauge transformations, we identify the gluing condition for gauge invariance and the corresponding integrable charges.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy from Heat Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for computing symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies (SREE) in charged quantum systems based on an improved heat kernel approach. Although the conventional Sommerfeld formula proves effective for neutral systems, it encounters limitations when gauge fields or chemical potentials are introduced due to incomplete residue prescriptions and violations of asymptotic boundary conditions. By reconstructing the analytic structure of the heat kernel using a sign-dependent phase factor, we derive a globally convergent expansion that reconciles discrete residue summations with continuous spectral decompositions. We further apply this framework to Gaussian continuous multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA) states and show that the entanglement entropy (EE) can be expressed in terms of the cMERA flow functions. In particular, we obtain a symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy flow equation in the presence of a chemical potential. This formulation extends naturally to arbitrary spacetime dimensions and recovers established results for neutral systems in the mu -&gt; 0 limit. We validate our framework through two settings: (1) exact agreement with (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) predictions using twist-operator techniques, and (2) consistency with holographic entropy calculations on S1 x H^(d-1) geometries. Our results both unify the treatment of charged and neutral entanglement entropy and extend this treatment to real-space renormalization frameworks, providing a robust tool for probing symmetry-resolved entanglement in conformal field theories, their holographic duals, and cMERA representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Area Operators in the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.</description>

      <title>On the phase of the de Sitter density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop gravitational path integral around Euclidean de Sitter space $S^D$ has a complex phase that casts doubt on a state counting interpretation. Recently, it was proposed to cancel this phase by including an observer. We explore this proposal in the case where the observer is a charged black hole in equilibrium with the de Sitter horizon. We compute the phase of the one-loop determinant within a two-dimensional dilaton gravity reduction, using both numerical and analytical methods. Our results interpolate between previous studies of a probe geodesic observer and the Nariai solution. We also revisit the prescription for going from the Euclidean path integral to the state-counting partition function, finding a positive sign in the final density of states.</description>

      <title>2D or not 2D: a "holographic dictionary'' for Lowest Landau Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 2D fermions on a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field, described by Landau levels. It is wellknown that, semiclassically, restriction to the lowest Landau levels (LLL) implies two constraints on a 4D phase space, that transforms the 2D coordinate space (x,y) into a 2D phase space, thanks to the non-zero Dirac bracket between x and y. A naive application of Dirac's prescription of quantizing LLL in terms of L2 functions of x (or of y) fails because the wavefunctions are functions of x and y. We are able, however, to construct a 1D QM, sitting differently inside the 2D QM, which describes the LLL physics. The construction includes an exact 1D-2D correspondence between the fermion density \rho(x,y) and the Wigner distribution of the 1D QM. In a suitable large N limit, (a) the Wigner distribution is upper bounded by 1, since a phase space cell can have at most one fermion (Pauli exclusion principle) and (b) the 1D-2D correspondence becomes an identity transformation. (a) and (b) imply an upper bound for the fermion density \rho(x,y). We also explore the entanglement entropy (EE) of subregions of the 2D noncommutative space. It behaves differently from conventional 2D systems as well as conventional 1D systems, falling somewhere between the two. The main new feature of the EE, directly attributable to the noncommutative space, is the absence of a logarithmic dependence on the size of the entangling region, even though there is a Fermi surface. In this paper, instead of working directly with the Landau problem, we consider a more general problem, of 2D fermions in a rotating harmonic trap, which reduces to the Landau problem in a special limit. Among other consequences of the emergent 1D physics, we find that post-quench dynamics of the (generalized) LLL system is computed more simply in 1D terms, which is described by well-developed methods of 2D phase space hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We chart the classical moduli space of heterotic strings with broken supersymmetry a la Scherk-Schwarz and gauge group rank reduced by 8 in eight dimensions. This space consists of four connected components, each with its own characteristic spectrum and T-duality group. Three of these components uplift to nine dimensions and can be described as Coxeter polyhedra, allowing an exact characterization of their maximal symmetry enhancements and decompactification limits. We determine the maximal enhancements in the eight dimensional theories using lattice based algorithms in the bosonic formulation, and perform an indepth analysis of their massless spectra. Finally we argue that one component has a supersymmetric $\mathcal{N} = 1$ sector described by BPS objects at strong coupling in a non-supersymmetric version of the type IIB string on $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with one $O7^+$-plane.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis).</description>

      <title>The Double-Copy Root of Hawking Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking radiation spectrum from a collapsing null shell can be derived via the double copy of a simpler gauge theory calculation. Analyzing the non-abelian Yang-Mills root of this process, we demonstrate that the radiation spectrum is thermal in the color charge eigenvalue $\lambda$, not energy. Considering the $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory in the large $N_c$ limit, we find the differential spectrum $dN/ d\lambda$ is a product of the gravitationally familiar Planck-like factor and the color phase space density, modeled here as the Wigner semicircle from random matrix theory. This reveals that apparent energy thermality in gravity is the direct dual of charge thermality in its underlying non-abelian gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to LQG black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian spinfoam gravity path integral and geometrical area-law entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient $\beta&gt;0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 &lt; \gamma \lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.</description>

      <title>On the summation and triangulation independence of Lorentzian spinfoam amplitudes for all LQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of 2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold. This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators from Partons to Hadrons: Unveiling the Dynamics of the Strong Interactions with Archival ALEPH Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a remarkably rich theory exhibiting numerous emergent degrees of freedom, from flux tubes to hadrons. Their description in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons of the QCD Lagrangian remains a central challenge of modern physics. Colliders offer a unique opportunity to probe these phenomena experimentally: high energy partons produced from the QCD vacuum excite these emergent degrees, imprinting their dynamics in correlations in asymptotic energy flux. Decoding these correlations requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, beyond that achieved in previous measurements. Recent progress has enabled precision calculations of energy flux on charged particles alone, allowing data-theory comparisons for measurements using high resolution tracking detectors. In this Letter, we resurrect thirty-year-old data from the ALEPH tracker, and perform a high angular resolution measurement of the two-point correlation of energy flux, probing QCD over three orders of magnitude in scale in a single measurement. Our measurement unveils for the first time the full spectrum of the correlator, including light-ray quasi-particle states, flux-tube excitations, and their transitions into confined hadrons. We compare our measurement with record precision theoretical predictions, achieving percent level agreement, and revealing interesting new phenomena in the confinement transitions. More broadly, we highlight the immense potential of this newly unlocked archival data set, the so called "recycling frontier", and emphasize synergies with ongoing and future collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Impact of a third body on binary neutron star tidal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For waveform modelling of compact binary coalescence, it is conventionally assumed that the binary is in isolation. In this work, we break that assumption and introduce a third body at a distance. The primary goal is to understand how the distant third body would affect the binary dynamics. However, in the present work, we treat the three-body problem perturbatively and study tidal interaction in the binary due to the third body's presence. We introduce appropriate modifications to the equations governing the orbital motions and the evolution equations of the binary component's quadrupole moment. Further, we obtain the radiated energy and accumulated dephasing for the binary. We show that for b-EMRI, the effect is weak in the tidal sector, while for systems such as b-IMRIs, it would be most relevant to study these effects.</description>

      <title>Probing Short-Distance Modifications of Gravity via Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent Effects in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of muonic atoms provides a powerful probe for new short-range interactions predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we derive new constraints on both spin-independent and spin-dependent non-Newtonian gravity by leveraging the outstanding sensitivity of these systems. For spin-independent Yukawa-type forces, we analyze two complementary approaches: the $2S-2P$ Lamb shift in the muonic helium-4 ion and the deuteron-proton squared charge radii difference obtained from the muonic hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift. The found constraints have reached a competitive level at sub-picometer scales, with the isotope shift method yielding the most stringent bounds for interaction ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-13}\text{m}$. For spin-dependent effects, we analyze the influence of the gravitational spin-orbit coupling on the $2P_{3/2}-2P_{1/2}$ fine-structure splitting in muonic helium, establishing new limits on Post-Newtonian parameters. These bounds are shown to be more restrictive than those from other leading experimental techniques for ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-10}\text{m}$. Our findings highlight the widespread usefulness of muonic atoms in exploring new fundamental physics at short-distance scales.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbation around a rotating Kalb-Ramond BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scalar perturbation of a newly proposed Kalb-Ramond (KR) BTZ-like black hole. After the separation of variables for the Klein-Gordon equation, we find that the radial part reduces to the general Heun equation. Using the Heun function, we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) subject to generic Robin boundary conditions, which shows that the KR parameter substantially modifies the QNM spectrum and only the fundamental mode on the left branch has an instability. To ascertain whether the instability is superradiant, we further analyze how the KR field changes the energy and angular momentum fluxes. Our results show that the KR parameter shifts the threshold and the range of the Robin coupling parameter where the superradiance occurs, underscoring the importance of the KR field in modeling black hole perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first study of traversable wormhole solutions in the background of Einstein-Aether theory. We show that the field equations admit some wormhole geometries, for several combinations of values of the aether coupling constants. We investigating the null and weak energy conditions for wormhole solutions with three types of the worm hole shape function. In contrast to Einstein gravity, we find that by choosing adequate values for the parameters of the models, wormhole geometries respect the energy conditions at the wormhole throat and also throughout the whole space. Satisfaction of these energy conditions led to some constraints on the value of the Einstein-Aether theory. Comparing these constraints with those previously obtained from theoretical and observational considerations, we find that the satisfaction of energy condition put more limitations on the values of the Einstein-Aether couplings.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative dyonic black holes sourced by nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>

      <title>Shadow of Extreme Compact Charged Objects in Consistent 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better describe gravitational phenomena on both very small and cosmological scales, there have been constant attempts to generalize and expand the theory of General Relativity (GR) since its inception. The Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) theory is one such extension that adds spacetime corrections related to curvature. Since the standard Gauss Bonnet term is purely topological, it does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions. To get around this restriction, however, an invariant four dimensional limit has been developed. In this work, we study Extreme Compact Charged Objects (ECCOs), which can resemble black holes, in a gravity framework that is compatible with Einstein Gauss Bonnet in four dimensions. Our main goal is to compare theoretical predictions with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data in order to constrain the Gauss Bonnet coupling constant {\alpha}. In order to achieve this, we investigate important optical characteristics like the shadow, light bending angle, and other associated observables, as well as the geodesic structure of ECCO spacetimes in EGB gravity. Finally, we apply these findings to constrain the Gauss Bonnet constant.</description>

      <title>Accretion Process as a Probe of Extra Dimensions in MOG Compact Object Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of extra spatial dimensions arises from attempts to unify gravity with other fundamental interactions, develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity, and address open problems in particle physics and cosmology. Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding how such dimensions modify gravitational theories. One way to probe their impact is through the analytical study of astrophysical processes such as black hole accretion. Since accretion efficiently converts gravitational energy into radiation, this makes it a powerful tool to test modified gravity (MOG) theories and higher-dimensional frameworks via the behavior of dark compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of neutral particles around a higher-dimensional, regular, spherically symmetric MOG compact object, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), energy flux, temperature, and differential luminosity. We further analyze the accretion of a perfect fluid onto the same object, deriving analytical expressions for the four-velocity and proper energy density of the inflowing matter. Our findings show that extra dimensions reduce the ISCO radius while enhancing the corresponding flux and temperature. Finally, by comparing the effective disk temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$ with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, we argue that MOG and higher-dimensional corrections to the accretion disk properties could be close to the current threshold of detectability.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis constraints on generalized mass-to-horizon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the cosmological framework based on a generalized mass-to-horizon entropy. This entropy, recently proposed as a power-law extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, arises from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius relation. By applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, the resulting corrections to the Friedmann equations modify the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Consequently, even the standard supergravity coupling between the Ricci scalar and the baryon current can generate a non-vanishing matter-antimatter asymmetry. Comparison with observational data yields a stringent constraint on the entropic exponent, namely $0 &lt; 1 - n \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, at the decoupling temperature $T_D \simeq 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}$, corresponding to the current upper limit on tensor-mode fluctuations at the inflationary scale. These findings indicate that minor, subtle, yet physically significant departures, from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy ($n = 1$) may be required to achieve full consistency with present cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from a Massive Vector Field in Generalized Proca Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we emphasise the recent observational findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2), which provide compelling evidence for a possible deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM (Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving effective dark energy component. Motivated by this, we construct a theoretical framework in which a massive cosmological vector field, $B^{\mu}$, couples non-minimally to the background curvature through marginal interactions, offering a controlled mechanism to realise the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. A detailed analysis of the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter $w(\tilde H)$ reveals a narrow region of parameter space consistent with current cosmological observations presented by DESI. The analysis yields a stringent upper bound for the coupling constant $\lambda$ to be $\lambda&lt;2.98\times10^{-11}$, a very strong bound on mass $3.1356\times10^{-66}~\text{g} \leq m \leq 3.3627\times10^{-66}~\text{g},$ and the admissible range $-0.405 \leq \log_{10}\tilde\gamma \leq -0.38$ for which present-day value $w_0 = w(\tilde H = 1)$ corresponding to a deviation $\delta = w_0 + 1$ that lies within the region $0.107 \leq \delta \leq 0.217$. This interval reproduces the deviation inferred from the combined DESI, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Pantheon+ data, reflecting a controlled departure from the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed framework of a massive vector field can account for the departure from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour highlighted by DESI in the current cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, the framework approaches the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in late-time $t\gtrsim28$ Gyr, establishing a direct phenomenological link between the underlying parameters and the observed dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use high-dimensional bosonization to derive an effective field theory that describes the Pomeranchuck transition in isotropic two-dimensional Fermi liquids. We find that the transition is triggered by the softening of an eigenmode that leads to spontaneous Fermi surface distortion. The resultant theory in terms of this critical mode has dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$ and the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4-z= 2$. As a result the system is at the upper critical dimension in 2D, resulting in a Gaussian fixed point with a marginally irrelevant quartic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Light Scalars in Light of UV/IR Mixing: Classicalization via Synergy between Vainshtein &amp; Chameleon Screenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories featuring light scalar fields play a pivotal role in addressing fundamental questions in (astro)particle physics and cosmology. However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects -- referred to as classicalons -- which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.</description>

      <title>The double copy effective action: a quantum (chromodynamics) approach to space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Lagrangian formulations of gauge and gravity theories emphasize compactness and off-shell symmetry. This often obscures the structure of on-shell physical observables. In this work, we present a constructive framework that elevates gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes to the defining data for quantum field theory actions, including effective field theories. Focusing on double-copy theories, we promote color-dual amplitude numerators to quantum operators. This enables the systematic identification of novel local operator content at each multiplicity and the construction of double-copy-compatible actions. By applying this framework to the well-established double-copy relationship between Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills theory, which holds for all-multiplicity tree-level amplitudes, we demonstrate a systematic path to constructing the operator expansion of $\sqrt{-g}R$ from factorized gauge-theory components. This clarifies how gravitational interactions can be understood as emerging from simpler gauge-theoretic structures at the action level. This formalism extends color-kinematics duality from amplitude data to operator constructions, naturally realizing the double copy at the level of actions and asymptotic quantum states. We illustrate the method with Yang-Mills theory, Einstein gravity, and its application to generating higher-derivative operators inspired by Z-theory and open superstring amplitudes. This work provides a concrete bridge between structured amplitudes and effective actions, offering a physically grounded alternative to traditional EFT basis-building. It reveals at the operator level deep structural connections between gauge theory and gravity (connections long recognized in scattering amplitudes) from fundamental interactions to their quantum state descriptions and higher-derivative extensions.</description>

Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points in several cases of interest. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.</description>

      <title>Giant Gravitons and Volume Minimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between the giant graviton expansion of the superconformal index of field theories in $D\leq 4$, and the master volume formalism of Gauntlett, Martelli and Sparks (GMS) which determines the near horizon geometries of certain BPS black holes and black strings in supergravity. We focus on 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories arising on the world volume of $N$ D3 branes placed at the tip of a cone over a toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold SE$_{5}$, the simplest example of which is $S^5$, corresponding to $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills. The giant graviton expansion realises the superconformal index as the sum of contributions from wrapped D3 branes in the dual AdS$_{5}\times \text{SE}_{5}$. We argue that, for large wrapping numbers, the asymptotics of each such contribution is governed by the master volume of a particular metric deformation of $\text{SE}_5$ (suitably fibred over $S^{3}$). In particular, the wrapping numbers of a generic giant graviton configuration are identified with K\"{a}hler moduli of the corresponding metric. We further show that at large $N$ the entropy function of the relevant AdS$_5\times \text{SE}_5$ BPS rotating black hole is recovered by extremising over these moduli. Our results suggest that the complex Euclidean geometries corresponding to rotating BPS black holes in AdS$_{5}$ are determined by a close analogue of GMS volume minimisation, and that conversely, the off-shell geometries considered in such minimisation procedures should be understood as the near-horizon geometries of back-reacted giant gravitons. We present analogous results for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories holographically dual to M-theory on AdS$_4\times \text{SE}_7$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and Ultraviolet Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by various quantum gravity approaches, we explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales, effectively behaving as a multifractal manifold. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such a multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach ensures perturbative UV finiteness and improved behavior of the series expansion and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture by breaking vacuum translational invariance. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the previously studied dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time performs a generalization of the multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated at the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models as well as $c=1$ models on a random surface. It is noted that some of these models can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS black hole microstate counting from holographic conformal quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we develop a prescription for describing BPS black hole microstates in terms of a holographic conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) model dual to the near-horizon $AdS_2$ geometry of the black hole. We use 1/2 BPS small black holes in a 4D ${\cal N}=4$ toroidal heterotic compactification as well as 1/8 BPS large black holes in a 4D ${\cal N}=8$ Type II toroidal compactification as test cases for our approach. In each case, the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular symmetries of the known generating function of the exact microstate degeneracies enables the latter to be expressed as a Rademacher series expansion, with each summand consisting of phases and a modified Bessel function of the first kind. We make a motivated ansatz that the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model (DFF) coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator is a universal sector of the holographic CQM dual to the BPS black hole's near-horizon $AdS_2$ geometry, and demonstrate how in both cases, the two parameters of this putative CQM, the DFF coupling as well as the oscillator frequency, exactly encode both the index and the argument of the Bessel function. Consequently, we extract the leading, logarithmic and all sub-leading power law black hole entropy contributions from calculations in the CQM. In the ${\cal N}=4$ case, the DFF ansatz is sufficient to successfully reproduce the exact microscopic generating function from the CQM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Upon performing radial quantization, we construct the Fock space of the theory and, via a three-dimensional analogue of the state-operator correspondence, we demonstrate that the algebra of local operators is endowed with the structure of a raviolo vertex algebra. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework for nonlocal Lagrangian systems without relying on infinite-derivative expansions. Starting from a (trajectory-based) variational principle and a generalized Noether theorem, we define the canonical momenta and energy. Moreover, we construct a (pre)symplectic form on the kinematic space, and show that its restriction to the phase space (by implementing the constraints) yields a true (pre)symplectic structure encoding the dynamics. Three examples -- a finite nonlocal oscillator, the fully nonlocal Pais-Uhlenbeck model, and a delayed harmonic oscillator -- demonstrate how phase space and the Hamiltonian emerge without explicitly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) framework, originally introduced by Marlan Scully et al. in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115, 8131 (2018), to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of string entanglement in string theory, which aims to study entanglement between worldsheet Hilbert spaces rather than entanglement between spacetime Hilbert spaces defined on a time slice in spacetime. Applying this framework to the FZZ duality and its extension to a three-dimensional black hole, we argue that the thermal entropy of 2d and 3d black holes is accounted for by the string entanglement entropy between folded strings arising in the dual sine-Liouville CFT. We compute this via a worldsheet replica method and show that it decomposes into two parts, which we call the vertex operator contribution and the replica contribution. The former can be evaluated analytically and is shown to coincide with the black hole thermal entropies in the low temperature limit in large D dimensions. Although a computation of the latter is left as an open problem, we present evidence that it captures the remaining portion of the black hole entropy.</description>

Abstract: A finite formulation of quantum field theory based on a system of differential equations reminiscent of the Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated in the bare language. We rederive it in a fully renormalized language. For the latter, within a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, it is shown that with a specific choice of renormalization conditions - namely, the on-shell scheme for the renormalized mass - this class of finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the standard renormalization-group equation written in the Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum chaotic behavior of black holes within the brickwall model, focusing on probe scalar fields in ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic AdS black holes. The brickwall model has captured the normal modes of BTZ black holes ($d=2$) with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon and their connection to quantum chaos signatures of random matrix theory. Here, we extend this framework to higher-dimensional AdS black holes ($d&gt;2$), exploring how black hole normal modes encode chaotic dynamics across dimensions and examining the universality of this approach. We show that quantum chaos is prominent in lower dimensions and persists in higher dimensions. Specifically, deviations from the logarithmic spectrum in $d=2$ evolves into a power-law spectrum at higher $d$, highlighting the sensitivity of black hole normal modes to dimensionality, while retaining signatures of quantum chaos despite the spectral deformation. Our results are supported by conventional diagnostics, including level spacing distributions and spectral form factors, as well as modern tools like Krylov complexity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the brickwall model in capturing chaotic behavior in the parametrically large dimension limit, where the spectrum becomes constant leading to degeneracy and a non-chaotic regime, while emphasizing its effectiveness as a tool for studying quantum aspects of black holes in moderate higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Locating the Ising CFT via the ground-state energy on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. Our strategy is to write the latter as $E_{GS}(N_m)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ \chi:=E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. Conformal perturbation theory predicts that around a CFT, $\chi= \chi_{\rm min} + \sum_i \lambda_i^2 N_m^{-\omega_i} + O(\lambda^3)$, where $\lambda_i$ are the couplings associated to perturbations of operators with dimension $\Delta_i$, and $\omega_i = d-\Delta_i$. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] and their sweet spot with good precision. Varying two coupling constants allows us to extract the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ associated to the two leading scalars $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$ instead of $E_0$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry, Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases where the total complexity fails to do so.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$ result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.</description>

      <title>Constrained Pad\'e Ensembles for Thermal N=4 SYM: Quantified Uncertainties and Next-Order Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the transition between weak and strong coupling in thermal $\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in four space-time dimensions by constructing an \emph{admissible ensemble} of log-aware Pad\'e approximants that exactly reproduce the weak- and strong-coupling expansions through $\mathcal O(\lambda^2)$ and $\mathcal O(\lambda^{-3/2})$ (where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling), including the nonanalytic $\lambda^{3/2}$ and $\lambda^{2}\log\lambda$ terms. This replaces single-curve estimates with a reproducible uncertainty band and a well-defined central curve across the intermediate regime. Applying the same construction to transport, the $\eta/s$ band connects perturbative behavior to the Kovtun-Son-Starinets limit. The framework is \emph{predictive}, yielding $A_{5/2}=0.476\pm0.095$ on the weak side and a model-independent bound on the next strong-coupling term, thereby setting testable benchmarks for forthcoming perturbative and holographic calculations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending "standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify and construct supersymmetric solutions of D=3, N=2 gauged supergravity extended with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and null and timelike warped AdS spacetimes are among them. From the first one, it is possible to obtain a well-defined black hole by periodic identification. We also find charged string solutions that interpolate between two supersymmetric AdS or Minkowski extrema of the scalar potential, one of which corresponds to a horizon with a singularity behind it, and the other determines the asymptotic geometry.</description>

      <title>Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Exotic quantum subgroups and extensions of affine Lie algebra VOAs -- part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prototypical rational vertex operator algebras are associated to affine Lie algebras at positive integer level k. They correspond physically to the Wess-Zumino-Witten theories, and their representation theory can be captured by quantum groups at roots of unity. One would like to identify the full (bulk) conformal field theories whose chiral halves are those VOAs. Mathematically, these correspond to their module categories. Until now, this has been done only for sl(2) (famously, the A-D-E classification of Cappelli-Itzykson-Zuber) and sl(3). The problem reduces to knowing the possible extensions of those VOAs, and the tensor equivalences between those extensions. Recent progress puts the tensor equivalences in good control, especially for sl(n). This paper focuses on the extensions. We prove that, for any simple g, there is a bound K(g) growing like rank$(g)^3$, such that for any level k&gt;K(g), the only extensions are generic (i.e. simple-current ones). We use that bound to find all extensions for g=sl(4) and sl(5), at all levels, as well as all g=sl(n) at levels $k\le 5$ (only those for k=1 had been classified before). In the sequel to this paper, we find all extensions for all simple g of rank &lt;7 (and the corresponding low level classifications).</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Insight into the Microstructures of Black Holes with Quantum-Triggered Violations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microstructures of a charged AdS (Anti-de Sitter) black hole exhibiting quantum anomalies through the lens of Ruppeiner geometry. Previous research has established that black holes undergo $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit critical phenomena near their critical points, characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. However, recent findings have revealed that black holes with quantum anomalies can violate these scaling laws. Motivated by these discoveries, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations and gain insights into the microstructure of such black holes. Our analysis aims to elucidate how quantum effects modify the microscopic properties of spacetime, offering a novel perspective on the understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV with natural Yukawa couplings of $O(1)$, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. It is intriguing to note that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the upper range of the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a new framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. With the neutrino seesaw mechanism, we construct a new realization of the Higgs modulated reheating, in which the fluctuations of Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays and contribute to the primordial curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate, for the first time, that such signatures provide an important means to directly probe the high scale of natural neutrino seesaw. We further analyze the interplay of the non-Gaussianity signatures with the low-energy neutrino experiments, and their interplay with the Higgs self-coupling measurements at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. In this Letter, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. In our framework, after inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field that act as the source of curvature perturbations. This gives a new realization of Higgs modulated reheating, and it produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures that can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Schr\"odinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform Bertotti-Robinson magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: The time-like structure of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat Horndeski black holes is studied in detail. Focusing on the motion of massive neutral test particles, we construct the corresponding effective potential and classify the admissible types of orbits. The equations of motion are solved analytically, yielding trajectories expressed in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String Theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the corrections proportional to the mass of the baryon junction M, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ is the length of the confining strings), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open string channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma} = 0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe hadrons, although our computation was done in (2+1) dimensions. In addition, studying the high temperature behavior of the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focusing on the high temperature regime, just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative predictions obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)\to D_s\pi^0$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For coupled channels $D^0K^+$, $D^+K^0$, $D_s^+\eta$, and $D_s^+\pi^0$, the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes are constructed taking into account the mixing of the isoscalar resonance $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+$ with nonresonance amplitudes with isospin $I=1$. The phenomenological approach we use allows us to quite simply clear up the general structure of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay amplitude violating isospin. We show that the phase of this amplitude coincides with the phase of the nonresonanct $D_s^+\pi^0 $ scattering amplitude in agreement with the Watson theorem. Its modulus squared, as it should be, determines the width of the resonance peak in the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel. Taking into account the $\pi^0-\eta$ mixing in internal lines up to the second order inclusively ensures that the unitarity condition is fulfilled. The presented analysis complements the description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317 )^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay based on the coupled channel unitarized chiral perturbation theory. The numerical estimates obtained by us for the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay width do not contradict those available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis can be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</description>

      <title>Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from a nonderived $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and a nonderived $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 3$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinct and resolvable signatures compared with Beta/NFW models. These findings deepen our understanding of dark matter halo effects on periodic motions and gravitational wave signatures, providing guidance on future space-based observation for EMRIs.</description>
