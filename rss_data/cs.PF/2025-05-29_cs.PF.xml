      <title>Profiling and optimization of multi-card GPU machine learning jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning methodologies are crucial, especially with respect to the quality of results and computational cost. This paper discusses different model optimization techniques, providing a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators. Several parallelization strategies for image recognition, adapted to different hardware and software configurations, including distributed data parallelism and distributed hardware processing, are analyzed. Selected optimization strategies are studied in detail, highlighting the related challenges and advantages of their implementation. Furthermore, the impact of different performance improvement techniques (DPO, LoRA, QLoRA, and QAT) on the tuning process of large language models is investigated. Experimental results illustrate how the nature of the task affects the iteration time in a multiprocessor environment, VRAM utilization, and overall memory transfers. Test scenarios are evaluated on the modern NVIDIA H100 GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for Reservoir-based Classifier: Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop an energy-efficient classifier for time-series data by introducing PatchEchoClassifier, a novel model that leverages a reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>Heavy-traffic Optimality of Skip-the-Longest-Queues in Heterogeneous Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time parallel service system consisting of $n$ heterogeneous single server queues with infinite capacity. Jobs arrive to the system as an i.i.d. process with rate proportional to $n$, and must be immediately dispatched in the time slot that they arrive. The dispatcher is assumed to be able to exchange messages with the servers to obtain their queue lengths and make dispatching decisions, introducing an undesirable communication overhead. In this setting, we propose a ultra-low communication overhead load balancing policy dubbed $k$-Skip-the-$d$-Longest-Queues ($k$-SLQ-$d$), where queue lengths are only observed every $k(n-d)$ time slots and, between observations, incoming jobs are sent to a queue that is not one of the $d$ longest ones at the time that the queues were last observed. For this policy, we establish conditions on $d$ for it to be throughput optimal and we show that, under that condition, it is asymptotically delay-optimal in heavy-traffic for arbitrarily low communication overheads (i.e., for arbitrarily large $k$).</description>

      <title>SLiM: One-shot Quantization and Sparsity with Low-rank Approximation for LLM Weight Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Edge-First Language Model Inference: Models, Metrics, and Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems across heterogeneous environments.</description>
