      <title>The Last Three T-degrees in Triply-Graded Link Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of reduced triply graded link homology $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ in the top/bottom three $T-$degrees for links arising as closures of positive/negative braids. Using a diagrammatic approach to the Hochschild cohomology of Soergel bimodules, we provide explicit computations of $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ as $R-$modules in these degrees. Our results reveal that the homology here is often zero, especially in the negative braid case, and display striking uniformity.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Calogero--Moser Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe completely the singularities appearing in Calogero--Moser varieties associated (at any parameter) to the wreath product symplectic reflection groups. We do so by parameterizing the symplectic leaves in the variety, describing combinatorially the resulting closure relation and computing a transverse slice to each leaf. We also show that the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf is isomorphic to a Calogero--Moser variety for an associated (explicit) subquotient of the symplectic reflection group. This confirms a conjecture of Bonnaf\'e for these groups. We use the fact that the Calogero--Moser varieties associated to wreath products can be identified with certain Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, our result identifying the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf with another quiver variety holds for arbitrary quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Parabolic quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximal parabolic subalgebras of untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras were studied in the context of Borel-de Siebenthal theory in [13], where they were realized as certain equivariant map algebras with a non-free abelian group action. In this paper, we show that this perspective naturally extends to non-maximal parabolic subalgebras and introduce their quantum analogues - called parabolic quantum affine algebras - in analogy with ordinary quantum affine algebras and their classical counterpart, the loop algebra. While the definition in the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation is straightforward, the realization in Drinfeld's second presentation requires quantum root vectors associated not only to simple roots but also to certain non-simple roots. A distinguished positive root $\gamma_0$ plays a central role in all constructions. Along the way, we construct a PBW-type basis, establish a second triangular decomposition, and determine the action of the braid group on the Cartan part of the algebra via Lusztig's automorphisms. Finally, we classify the finite-dimensional irreducible representations under a technical condition on $\gamma_0$, referred to as repetition-free, in terms of Drinfeld polynomials with some additional data. The key difference from the ordinary quantum affine case is that the degrees of the polynomials are only bounded by a certain highest weight, rather than being uniquely determined by it. In the maximal parabolic case, the classification can alternatively be phrased in terms of Drinfeld polynomials satisfying certain divisibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Chern character operators and Okounkov's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chern character operators on the equivariant cohomology of the Hilbert schemes of points in the complex affine plane $C^2$ with the action of the torus $(C^*)^2$, and partially verify Okounkov's Conjecture [Oko, Conjecture 2] in this setting. Our main idea is to apply the connection between the equivariant cohomology of these Hilbert schemes and the ring of symmetric functions, via the deformed vertex operators of Cheng and Wang [CW], (the integral form of) the Jack symmetric functions and the transformed Macdonald symmetric functions of Garsia and Haiman [GH, Hai].</description>

Abstract: We complete the proof of the McKay--Navarro conjecture (also known as the Galois--McKay conjecture) for the prime 2, by completing the proof of the inductive McKay--Navarro conditions introduced by Navarro--Sp\"ath--Vallejo in this situation.</description>

      <title>Monomial stability of Frobenius images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study representation stability in the sense of Church, Ellenberg, and Farb \cite{FI-module} through the lens of symmetric function theory and the different symmetric function bases. We show that a sequence, $(F_n)_n$, where $F_n$ is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree $n$, has stabilizing Schur coefficients if and only if it has stabilizing monomial coefficients. More generally, we develop a framework for checking when stabilizing coefficients transfer from one symmetric function basis to another. We also see how one may compute representation stable ranges from the monomial expansions of the $F_n$.\parspace
  As applications, we reprove and refine the representation stability of diagonal coinvariant algebras, $DR_n$. We also observe new representation stability phenomena of the Garsia-Haiman modules. This establishes certain stability properties of the modified Macdonald polynomials, $\tilde{H}_{\mu[n]}[X;q,t]$, and the modified $q,t$-Kostka numbers, $\tilde{K}_{\mu[n],\nu[n]}(q,t)$. In an upcoming addition to the paper, these methods will be be applied to \textit{any} sequence $\tilde{H}_{\mu^{(n)}}[X;q,t]$ with $|\mu^{(n)}|=n$ and $\mu^{(n)}\subseteq \mu^{(n+1)}$.</description>
