      <title>Can Large Language Models Correctly Interpret Equations with Errors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models to accurately translate student written equations from the Australian Physics Olympiads into a standard format. Large Language Models were used to extract equations from student responses and convert these into a standardised format for a computer algebra system. Models with more than fourteen billion parameters were unable to complete the task in the required timeframe. No open source model was able to achieve the desired level of accuracy given resource constraints available for marking the exam. To improve the accuracy, we implement LLM-modulo and consensus frameworks and report on the results. Future work to improve performance could involve breaking the task into smaller components before parsing to the models.</description>

      <title>Sonification of entanglement dynamics in many-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics poses significant challenges for audio-visual representation, particularly concerning quantum entanglement. Sonification -- the auditory representation of data -- offers a promising complementary approach. This paper investigates sonification techniques applied to dynamical entanglement generation in many-qubit systems with the help of phase space methods and entanglement measure. We study dynamics of entanglement generation in many-qubit system in dynamical protocol governed by two models: the one-axis twisting model, and a quantum kicked-rotor exhibiting both regular and quantum chaotic behavior. We present a procedure of entanglement dynamics sonification, allowing mapping the phase-space representation of a many-qubit quantum state and von Neuman entanglement entropy to sound. Results demonstrate how sonification enhances perception of dynamic entanglement offering intuitive and artistic insight into quantum correlations behaviors.</description>

      <title>Quantum counting, and a relevant sign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two indispensable algorithms in an introductory course on Quantum Computing are Grover's search algorithm and quantum phase estimation. Quantum counting is a simple yet beautiful blend of these two algorithms, and it is therefore an attractive topic for a student project in such a course. However, a sign that is irrelevant when implementing Grover's algorithm becomes relevant. We briefly review these algorithms, highlighting the aforementioned sign.</description>

      <title>Performance of ChatGPT on tasks involving physics visual representations: the case of the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are increasingly influencing physics education due to their ability to interpret and respond to textual and visual inputs. This study evaluates the performance of two large multimodal model-based chatbots, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o on the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA), a conceptual physics inventory rich in visual representations such as vector fields, circuit diagrams, and graphs. Quantitative analysis shows that ChatGPT-4o outperforms both ChatGPT-4 and a large sample of university students, and demonstrates improvements in ChatGPT-4o's vision interpretation ability over its predecessor ChatGPT-4. However, qualitative analysis of ChatGPT-4o's responses reveals persistent challenges. We identified three types of difficulties in the chatbot's responses to tasks on BEMA: (1) difficulties with visual interpretation, (2) difficulties in providing correct physics laws or rules, and (3) difficulties with spatial coordination and application of physics representations. Spatial reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring the use of the right-hand rule, proved especially problematic. These findings highlight that the most broadly used large multimodal model-based chatbot, ChatGPT-4o, still exhibits significant difficulties in engaging with physics tasks involving visual representations. While the chatbot shows potential for educational applications, including personalized tutoring and accessibility support for students who are blind or have low vision, its limitations necessitate caution. On the other hand, our findings can also be leveraged to design assessments that are difficult for chatbots to solve.</description>
