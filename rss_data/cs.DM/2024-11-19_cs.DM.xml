      <title>On the compressiveness of the Burrows-Wheeler transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is a reversible transform that converts a string $w$ into another string $\mathsf{BWT}(w)$. The size of the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) can be interpreted as a measure of repetitiveness in the class of representations called dictionary compression which are essentially representations based on copy and paste operations. In this paper, we shed new light on the compressiveness of BWT and the bijective BWT (BBWT). We first extend previous results on the relations of their run-length compressed sizes $r$ and $r_B$. We also show that the so-called ``clustering effect'' of BWT and BBWT can be captured by measures other than empirical entropy or run-length encoding. In particular, we show that BWT and BBWT do not increase the repetitiveness of the string with respect to various measures based on dictionary compression by more than a polylogarithmic factor. Furthermore, we show that there exists an infinite family of strings that are maximally incompressible by any dictionary compression measure, but become very compressible after applying BBWT. An interesting implication of this result is that it is possible to transcend dictionary compression in some cases by simply applying BBWT before applying dictionary compression.</description>

      <title>Pricing Filtering in Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column generation is used alongside Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition, especially for linear programs having a decomposable pricing step requiring to solve numerous independent pricing subproblems. We propose a filtering method to detect which pricing subproblems may have improving columns, and only those subproblems are solved during pricing. This filtering is done by providing light, computable bounds using dual information from previous iterations of the column generation. The experiments show a significant impact on different combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phase transitions in combinatorial optimization problems, we define two kinds of geometry-preserving reductions between constraint satisfaction problems and other NP-search problems. We give a couple of examples and counterexamples for these reductions.  </description>

      <title>Hereditary First-Order Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computational problems can be modelled as the class of all finite relational structures $\mathbb A$ that satisfy a fixed first-order sentence $\phi$ hereditarily, i.e., we require that every substructure of $\mathbb A$ satisfies $\phi$. In this case, we say that the class is in HerFO. The problems in HerFO are always in coNP, and sometimes coNP-complete. HerFO also contains many interesting computational problems in P, including many constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We show that HerFO captures the class of complements of CSPs for reducts of finitely bounded structures, i.e., every such CSP is polynomial-time equivalent to the complement of a problem in HerFO. However, we also prove that HerFO does not have the full computational power of coNP: there are problems in coNP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in HerFO, unless E=NE. Another main result is a description of the quantifier-prefixes for $\phi$ such that hereditarily checking $\phi$ is in P; we show that for every other quantifier-prefix there exists a formula $\phi$ with this prefix such that hereditarily checking $\phi$ is coNP-complete.</description>

      <title>Invariant Polydiagonal Subspaces of Matrices and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a polydiagonal subspace of the Euclidean space, certain components of the vectors are equal (synchrony) or opposite (anti-synchrony). Polydiagonal subspaces invariant under a matrix have many applications in graph theory and dynamical systems, especially coupled cell networks. We describe invariant polydiagonal subspaces in terms of coloring vectors. This approach gives an easy formulation of a constraint satisfaction problem for finding invariant polydiagonal subspaces. Solving the resulting problem with existing state-of-the-art constraint solvers greatly outperforms the currently known algorithms.</description>

      <title>Approximation algorithms for non-sequential star packing problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k \ge 1$, a $k$-star ($k^+$-star, $k^-$-star, respectively) is a connected graph containing a degree-$\ell$ vertex and $\ell$ degree-$1$ vertices, where $\ell = k$ ($\ell \ge k$, $1 \le \ell \le k$, respectively). The $k^+$-star packing problem is to cover as many vertices of an input graph $G$ as possible using vertex-disjoint $k^+$-stars in $G$; and given $k &gt; t \ge 1$, the $k^-/t$-star packing problem is to cover as many vertices of $G$ as possible using vertex-disjoint $k^-$-stars but no $t$-stars in $G$. Both problems are NP-hard for any fixed $k \ge 2$. We present a $(1 + \frac {k^2}{2k+1})$- and a $\frac 32$-approximation algorithms for the $k^+$-star packing problem when $k \ge 3$ and $k = 2$, respectively, and a $(1 + \frac 1{t + 1 + 1/k})$-approximation algorithm for the $k^-/t$-star packing problem when $k &gt; t \ge 2$. They are all local search algorithms and they improve the best known approximation algorithms for the problems, respectively.</description>

      <title>Explicit Two-Sided Vertex Expanders Beyond the Spectral Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first explicit two-sided vertex expanders that bypass the spectral barrier.
  Previously, the strongest known explicit vertex expanders were given by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs, whose spectral properties imply that every small subset of vertices $S$ has at least $0.5d|S|$ distinct neighbors. However, it is possible to construct Ramanujan graphs containing a small set $S$ with no more than $0.5d|S|$ neighbors. In fact, no explicit construction was known to break the $0.5 d$-barrier.
  In this work, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs (for large enough $d$) where every small set expands by a factor of $\approx 0.6d$. More generally, for large enough $d_1,d_2$, we give an infinite family of $(d_1,d_2)$-biregular graphs where small sets on the left expand by a factor of $\approx 0.6d_1$, and small sets on the right expand by a factor of $\approx 0.6d_2$. In fact, our construction satisfies an even stronger property: small sets on the left and right have unique-neighbor expansion $0.6d_1$ and $0.6d_2$ respectively.
  Our construction follows the tripartite line product framework of Hsieh, McKenzie, Mohanty &amp; Paredes, and instantiates it using the face-vertex incidence of the $4$-dimensional Ramanujan clique complex as its base component. As a key part of our analysis, we derive new bounds on the triangle density of small sets in the Ramanujan clique complex.</description>

      <title>Stack and Queue Numbers of Graphs Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing question of the mutual relation between the stack and queue numbers of a graph, explicitly emphasized by Dujmovi\'c and Wood in 2005, was "half-answered" by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Hickingbotham, Morin and Wood in 2022; they proved the existence of a graph family with the queue number at most 4 but unbounded stack number. We give an alternative very short, and still elementary, proof of the same fact.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes $Q_{n,2}$ with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrates on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083\%$ of values where $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds of $h$ mentioned above are both tight.</description>

      <title>Bounded degree QBF and positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of SAT and its variants has provided numerous NP-complete problems, from which most NP-hardness results were derived. Due to the NP-hardness of SAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or to obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of several problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also NP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions even with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a function of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for QBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of a maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However, surprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided in polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct consequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter positional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree hypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree hypergraphs.</description>
