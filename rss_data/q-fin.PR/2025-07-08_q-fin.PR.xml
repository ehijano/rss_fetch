      <title>Dynamic Asset Pricing with {\alpha}-MEU Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic asset pricing problem in which a representative agent is ambiguous about the aggregate endowment growth rate and trades a risky stock, human capital, and a risk-free asset to maximize her preference value of consumption represented by the {\alpha}-maxmin expected utility model. This preference model is known to be dynamically inconsistent, so we consider intra-personal equilibrium strategies for the representative agent and define the market equilibrium as the one in which the strategy that clears the market is an intra-personal equilibrium. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium and show that the asset prices in the equilibrium are the same as in the case when the agent does not perceive any ambiguity but believes in a particular probabilistic model of the endowment process. We show that with reasonable parameter values, the more ambiguity the agent perceives or the more ambiguity-averse she is, the lower the risk-free rate, the higher the stock price, the higher the stock risk premium, and the lower the stock volatility.</description>

      <title>Perpetual American Standard and Lookback Options in Insider Models with Progressively Enlarged Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive closed-form solutions to the optimal stopping problems related to the pricing of perpetual American standard and lookback put and call options in the extensions of the Black-Merton-Scholes model with progressively enlarged filtrations. More specifically, the information available to the insider is modelled by Brownian filtrations progressively enlarged with the times of either the global maximum or minimum of the underlying risky asset price over the infinite time interval, which is not a stopping time in the filtration generated by the underlying risky asset. We show that the optimal exercise times are the first times at which the asset price process reaches either lower or upper stochastic boundaries depending on the current values of its running maximum or minimum given the occurrence of times of either the global maximum or minimum, respectively. The proof is based on the reduction of the original problems into the necessarily three-dimensional optimal stopping problems and the equivalent free-boundary problems. We apply either the normal-reflection or the normal-entrance conditions as well as the smooth-fit conditions for the value functions to characterise the candidate boundaries as either the maximal or minimal solutions to the associated first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations and the transcendental arithmetic equations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enforcing asymptotic behavior with DNNs for approximation and regression in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple methodology to approximate functions with given asymptotic behavior by specifically constructed terms and an unconstrained deep neural network (DNN).
  The methodology we describe extends to various asymptotic behaviors and multiple dimensions and is easy to implement. In this work we demonstrate it for linear asymptotic behavior in one-dimensional examples. We apply it to function approximation and regression problems where we measure approximation of only function values (``Vanilla Machine Learning''-VML) or also approximation of function and derivative values (``Differential Machine Learning''-DML) on several examples. We see that enforcing given asymptotic behavior leads to better approximation and faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variance measures the portfolio risks the investors are taking. The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at the current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio and assess the current return, variance, and hence the current risks of his portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of trades with the portfolio determine its return and variance in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of the portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities, which is a quadratic form in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities. Its coefficients themselves are quadratic forms in the variables of relative numbers of shares of its securities. If one assumes that the volumes of all consecutive deals with each security are constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) variance, which ignores the effects of random trade volumes. The use of the variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes could help majors like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models, like Aladdin and Azimov, to the reality of random markets.</description>
