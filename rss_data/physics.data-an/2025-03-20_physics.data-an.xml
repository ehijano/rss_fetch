      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy has emerged as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and widely accepted quantitative measure of uncertainty across different disciplines. A unified understanding of entropy measures, supported by a detailed review of their theoretical foundations and practical applications, is crucial to advance research across disciplines. This review article provides motivation, fundamental properties, and constraints of various entropy measures. These measures are categorized with time evolution ranging from Shannon entropy generalizations, distribution function theory, fuzzy theory, fractional calculus to graph theory, all explained in a simplified and accessible manner. These entropy measures are selected on the basis of their usability, with descriptions arranged chronologically. We have further discussed the applicability of these measures across different domains, including thermodynamics, communication theory, financial engineering, categorical data, artificial intelligence, signal processing, and chemical and biological systems, highlighting their multifaceted roles. A number of examples are included to demonstrate the prominence of specific measures in terms of their applicability. The article also focuses on entropy-based applications in different disciplines, emphasizing openly accessible resources. Furthermore, this article emphasizes the applicability of various entropy measures in the field of finance. The article may provide a good insight to the researchers and experts working to quantify uncertainties, along with potential future directions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Tool for Advanced Analysis of Geant4 Simulations of Charged Particles Interactions in Oriented Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel Python tool for the analysis of Geant4 simulations that enhances our understanding of coherent phenomena occurring during the interaction of charged particles with crystal planes. This tool compares the total energy of particles with the potential energy inside crystal channels, enabling a complete examination of coherent effects. By tracking the particle trajectory and classifying the dynamics at each simulation step, it provides deeper insights into how different phenomena contribute to both radiation and particle deflection. This tool can be used to improve crystal-based extraction methods and the development of gamma-ray sources using crystals.</description>

      <title>Modeling late-time sensitivity to initial conditions in Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article sheds light on the late-time influence of initial conditions in Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence using an approach combining direct numerical simulations, machine learning and theory. The initial conditions are characterized by four non-dimensional numbers describing the statistical properties of random-phase multi-mode perturbations of an initial diffuse interface. Based on high-fidelity data, a surrogate physics-informed neural network is used to extrapolate the dynamics to very late times and unseen initial conditions, beyond the reach of simulations. This enables uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to be carried out, revealing the influence of initial conditions in the late-time regime. While the results support the idea of a universal self-similar growth rate, the virtual time origin is found to be strongly sensitive to the initial Reynolds, perturbation steepness and bandwidth numbers. An analytical model based on the phenomenology of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layers explains most of this dependency, and provide accurate predictions for the virtual time origin. It turns out that when the initial perturbation reaches nonlinear saturation earlier, the mixing layer also re-accelerates earlier, while the virtual time origin is larger.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Unmixing using Iterative, Sparse and Ensambling Approaches for Large Spectral Libraries Applied to Soils and Minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmixing is a fundamental process in hyperspectral image processing in which the materials present in a mixed pixel are determined based on the spectra of candidate materials and the pixel spectrum. Practical and general utility requires a large spectral library with sample measurements covering the full variation in each candidate material as well as a sufficiently varied collection of potential materials. However, any spectral library with more spectra than bands will lead to an ill-posed inversion problem when using classical least-squares regression-based unmixing methods. Moreover, for numerical and dimensionality reasons, libraries with over 10 or 20 spectra behave computationally as though they are ill-posed. In current practice, unmixing is often applied to imagery using manually-selected materials or image endmembers. General unmixing of a spectrum from an unknown material with a large spectral library requires some form of sparse regression; regression where only a small number of coefficients are nonzero. This requires a trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model size. In this study we compare variations of two sparse regression techniques, focusing on the relationship between structure and chemistry of materials and the accuracy of the various models for identifying the correct mixture of materials present. Specifically, we examine LASSO regression and ElasticNet in contrast with variations of iterative feature selection, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and quadratic BMA (BMA-Q) -- incorporating LASSO regression and ElasticNet as their base model. To evaluate the the effectiveness of these methods, we consider the molecular composition similarities and differences of substances selected in the models compared to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph reconstruction from dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of methods have been developed in the past two decades to infer the underlying network structure of an interconnected system from its collective dynamics. However, methods capable of inferring nonpairwise interactions are only starting to appear. Here, we develop an inference algorithm based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to reconstruct hypergraphs and simplicial complexes from time-series data. Our model-free method does not require information about node dynamics or coupling functions, making it applicable to complex systems that do not have a reliable mathematical description. We first benchmark the new method on synthetic data generated from Kuramoto and Lorenz dynamics. We then use it to infer the effective connectivity in the brain from resting-state EEG data, which reveals significant contributions from non-pairwise interactions in shaping the macroscopic brain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient $R^2$ on Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data with a linear trend, it is important to note that, in some cases, they may encounter overfitting issues during the training phase, which could result in negative values of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ for unseen data. For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.</description>
