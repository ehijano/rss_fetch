      <title>On Focusing Statistical Power for Searches and Measurements in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle physics experiments rely on the (generalised) likelihood ratio test (LRT) for searches and measurements, which consist of composite hypothesis tests. However, this test is not guaranteed to be optimal, as the Neyman-Pearson lemma pertains only to simple hypothesis tests. Any choice of test statistic thus implicitly determines how statistical power varies across the parameter space. An improvement in the core statistical testing methodology for general settings with composite tests would have widespread ramifications across experiments. We discuss an alternate test statistic that provides the data analyzer an ability to focus the power of the test on physics-motivated regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate the improvement from this technique compared to the LRT on a Higgs $\rightarrow\tau\tau$ dataset simulated by the ATLAS experiment and a dark matter dataset inspired by the LZ experiment. We also employ machine learning to efficiently perform the Neyman construction, which is essential to ensure statistically valid confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Three-Level Absorption Refrigerator at Third-Order Liouvillian Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs) in the three-level quantum absorption refrigerator, putting emphasis on the non-equilibrium process before the convergence to the steady state. We search for the second-order and third-order LEPs in the system with two types of couplings. Focusing on the third-order LEPs, we analyze the damping of the system state in the long term analytically and numerically. In addition, we analyze the damping of heat currents and the influence of the non-equilibrium process in the heat extraction from the cold bath. Critical damping at LEPs of both the system state and the heat currents is achieved, implying the fastest convergence to the equilibrium system. During the non-equilibrium process, we find that much heat transfer from the cold bath to the hot bath with less energy cost of the work bath is achieved at the third-order LEP, leading to better performance of the refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}): A physics-data hybrid-driven approach for discovering dimensionless parameter combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters, making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions through optimal parameter transformations.</description>

      <title>LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.</description>
