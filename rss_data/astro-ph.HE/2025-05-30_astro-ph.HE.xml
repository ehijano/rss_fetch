      <title>The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.</description>

      <title>Effect of positronium on the $\gamma$-ray spectra and energy deposition in Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powered by the radioactive decay of isotopes such as $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, making their $\gamma$-ray spectra useful probes of the explosion mechanism and ejecta structure. Accurate interpretation of $\gamma$-ray observables, including line ratios and continuum fluxes, requires a detailed understanding of the microphysical processes that shape the spectra. One such process is positronium formation during electron-positron annihilation, which can redistribute flux from the 511 keV line into the surrounding continuum. To assess the impact of positronium on the emergent spectra, we developed a new open-source module TARDIS-HE, for time-dependent three-dimensional $\gamma$-ray transport, integrated into the radiative transfer code TARDIS. The code simulates $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves from one-dimensional supernova ejecta models and allows for flexible incorporation of decay chains and opacity treatments. Using TARDIS-HE, we explore the effect of positronium formation by varying the positronium fraction from 0 % to 100 %, and assuming an extreme case where 75 % of positronium decays result in three-photon emission. We find that full positronium formation can reduce the 511 keV line flux by approximately 70 % and modestly enhance energy deposition by up to 2 % at around 100 days post-explosion, compared to models without positronium. These results demonstrate that while the effect is not dominant, positronium formation introduces measurable changes to $\gamma$-ray observables. Future observations with missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) may offer constraints on positronium formation in SNe Ia and help refine models of their radioactive energy transport.</description>

      <title>Global resistive MHD accretion flows around spinning AGNs: impact of resistivity on MAD state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of resistivity on the dynamics of global magnetohydrodynamic accretion flows (Res-MHD) around a spinning supermassive black hole. We perform a comparative study of 2D and 3D resistive models around black holes. We examine accretion flow dynamics considering globally uniform resistivity values, ranging from $\sim 0$ to 0.1. During the simulation time of $t \lesssim 1000~t_g$, we find that the mass accretion rate is comparable for both the 2D and 3D models. However, as the flow becomes increasingly turbulent, non-axisymmetric effects begin to dominate, resulting in significant differences in the mass accretion rates between the 3D and 2D. All the resistive models in a highly magnetized flow belong to the Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) state. We propose an efficient and physically motivated approach to examine the magnetic state by estimating the spatial average plasma beta parameter across the computational domain. We find that when the average plasma beta is close to or below unity $( \beta_{\text{ave}} \lesssim 1 )$, the accretion flow enters the MAD state. Additionally, we find that high-resistivity flow reduces magnetorotational instability (MRI) turbulence in the accretion flow, while the turbulence structures remain qualitatively similar in low-resistivity flows. Moreover, we observe indications of plasmoid formations in low-resistivity flow compared to high-resistivity flow. Furthermore, we do not find a clear relationship between the variability of the accretion rate, magnetic flux, and resistivity. Lastly, our findings suggest that low-resistivity models produce higher power jets than those with higher resistivity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Complex Jet Dynamics in the Blazar 2021+317 through Multi-Epoch VLBI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the compact structure of the AGN 2021+317 based on multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at 15, 22, and 43 GHz in the period from 2013 through 2024. The VLBI images show a core-jet structure extended to the south, with two stationary components in the northern region, one of which likely to be the core of the source. We also detected two new moving jet components (S4 and S5) in the observations of 2021. Based on these observational findings, we analyzed two distinctive jet models, involving one or another stationary component mentioned above as the jet core. One model assumes a moderate bulk motion velocity, a wider viewing angle, and a lower Doppler factor, with the magnetic field energy density significantly dominating over non-thermal particle energy density. The other model involves a higher bulk motion velocity, a narrower viewing angle, and a higher Doppler factor, with an even greater dominance of magnetic field energy in the core. The position angle of the jet ridge line rotates counter-clockwise over the observed period. The apparent kinematics of the jet components is more consistent with a model of the precessing jet, which has recently completed the first half of the precession cycle. Our results provide constraints on the dynamic evolution of the jet and its interaction with the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Statistical Insights into Flux and Photon Index Distributions of VHE FSRQs from Fermi-LAT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the flux and photon index distributions of 11 Very High Energy (VHE) Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) using over 16 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data. The distributions reveal double lognormal profiles in both flux and index, primarily in the 3-day and 7-day binnings, supporting the ``two-flux-state hypothesis" for blazars. These profiles, which become insignificant at 30-day binning, suggest that shorter timescales are better at capturing distinct states, while longer timescales smooth out shorter variations. Most VHE FSRQs exhibit a ``harder-when-brighter" trend, where the photon index decreases during high-flux states, suggesting efficient particle acceleration and possibly reduced radiative cooling. In contrast, two sources display a ``softer-when-brighter" behavior, likely due to enhanced radiative cooling in high photon density environments. Additionally, we observe that the Spearman rank correlation between flux and photon index strengthens with increasing time bin sizes, indicating more pronounced correlations over longer timescales. This possibly indicates that, on shorter timescales, flux variations are driven by a combination of photon index changes and normalization effects. Averaging flux over longer durations minimizes the effect of normalization variation, thereby enhancing the observed correlation. We also compare the flux and index distributions of VHE and non-VHE FSRQs, emphasizing the differences in their variability and emission patterns.</description>

      <title>An energy approach to pulsar-disc interaction: disc stability and implications for transitional millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of an accretion disc surrounding a millisecond pulsar is analysed from an energetic point of view, using magnetohydrodynamic simulations that consider realistic disc structures and a variety of magnetic field inclination angles. The time-averaged components of the magnetic field interact with the disc through ohmic dissipation, which causes heating and partial evaporation of its innermost region. The stability of the disc right after the magnetic field is turned on is analysed as a function of the location of the inner radius of the disc and the magnetic inclination angle. Our results show that the disc is severely altered in those cases where its inner radius lies well beyond the light cylinder and the magnetic axis is not totally aligned with the neutron star spin axis. Overall, the results of the simulations agree with those obtained in previous works where analytical or semi-analytical energy models were also used to discuss the stability of the disc. The implications for the understanding of the transitional millisecond pulsars are discussed. We briefly mention implications of our results for low-mass X-ray binaries and supernova fallback discs.</description>

      <title>Measuring pulsar profile variations with 2-D Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-correlated variations in the pulse profiles of radio pulsars provide insights into changes in their magnetospheres. For a small number of pulsars (~20), these variations have been shown to correlate with spin-down rate. Many of these profile changes involve small (few percent) variations in the relative intensity of different profile components, and hence tools such as Gaussian process regression have been employed to separate the time-correlated profile variation from intrinsic noise. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation of a 2-D Gaussian process model that enhances sensitivity by simultaneously tracking time- and phase-correlated signals. Applying this model to 26 pulsars observed at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we detect significant profile shape variations in 21 pulsars. Using principal component analysis, we confirm spin-down correlated shape variations in 11 pulsars where this had been previously observed. Additionally, we find evidence of spin-down correlated shape changes in 7 pulsars for the first time (PSRs B0105+65, B0611+22, B0626+24, B1740-03, B1826-17, B1917+00, and B2148+63). We look in greater detail at PSR B0740-28, where the correlation between profile shape and spin-down itself seems to switch between quasi-stable states. Notably the profile shape associated with greater spin-down seems to invert at times, presenting a challenge to our understanding of the physical processes at work.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Variability Analysis of Blazars Using Fermi Light Curves Across Multiple Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of long-term Fermi-LAT \gamma-ray data for a sample of blazars, including FSRQs, BL\,Lacs, and BCUs, to investigate their $\gamma$-ray variability. We focused on light curves binned in 3-, 7-, and 30-day intervals to assess the impact of binning, using data with TS &gt;4 as a detection threshold. We calculated fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) for each category and found that FSRQs exhibit higher mean variability compared to BL\,Lacs and BCUs, with BCUs displaying intermediate variability closer to BL\,Lacs. The KS test on the variability distributions indicates that FSRQs differ from both BL Lacs and BCUs, whereas BCUs are more similar to BL Lacs. The higher variability in FSRQs is likely linked to more powerful jets and accretion. The correlation between \gamma-ray flux and spectral index suggests a moderate positive correlation for BL Lacs and BCUs, indicating a "softer when brighter" behavior. FSRQs displayed a mild anticorrelation, suggesting these sources tend to become harder as their flux increases. Analysis of flux distributions revealed log-normal behavior in many sources, consistent with multiplicative variability in blazar jets. Some sources show bimodal distributions, implying transitions between emission states. Binning affects the observed variability, with longer bins smoothing short-term fluctuations. Power spectral density analysis suggests FSRQs exhibit steeper slopes, reflecting structured variability, while BL Lacs display shallower slopes, dominated by stochastic processes. The absence of PSD breaks suggests no dominant timescale within the Fermi window. Spectral index distributions further highlight complexity, often requiring multi-component models.</description>

      <title>Optical Photometric Monitoring of the Blazar OT 355 and Local Standard Stars' Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OT 355 (4FGL J1734.3 + 3858) is a relatively rarely studied but highly variable, moderate-redshift (z = 0.975) flat-spectrum radio quasar (blazar). With this work, we aim to study its optical variability on different timescales, which can help us to better understand the physical processes in relativistic jets operating in blazar-type active galactic nuclei. OT 355 was observed in four colors (BVRI) during 41 nights between 2017 and 2023 using three 1 and 2 m class telescopes. The object was also monitored on intra-night timescales, for about 100 h in total. In addition, secondary standard stars in the field of OT 355 were calibrated in order to facilitate future photometric studies. We detected significant intra-night and night-to-night variations of up to 0.5 mag. Variability characteristics, color changes, and a possible ``rms-flux'' relation were studied and discussed. Using simple arguments, we show that a negative ``rms-flux'' relation should be expected if many independent processes/regions drive the short-term variability via Doppler factor changes, which is not observed in this and other cases. This finding raises arguments for the idea that more complex multiplicative processes are responsible for blazar variability. Studying blazar variability, especially on the shortest possible timescales, can help to estimate the strength and geometry of their magnetic fields, the linear sizes of the emitting regions, and other aspects, which may be of importance for constraining and modeling blazars' emitting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Year-timescale Gamma-ray Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Blazars: Evidence for Supermassive Binary Black Holes Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the gamma-ray emissions of blazars. Utilizing 15 years of Fermi-LAT observations of seven blazars in our sample, we identify both long-term and transient quasi-periodic oscillations in the gamma-ray light curves, with timescales ranging from a few months to years. These periodicities were detected using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and REDFIT techniques. To robustly evaluate the statistical significance of the quasi-periodic signals observed in the Lomb-Scargle Periodograms, 30,000 synthetic $\gamma$-ray light curves were generated for each source using a stochastic model known as the Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. To investigate the physical origin of the observed gamma-ray QPOs with different timescales, we explore several plausible scenarios, with particular emphasis on a relativistic jet hosted by one of the black holes in a supermassive binary black hole system, jet precession, and helical motion of magnetized plasma blob within the jet. The $\gamma$-ray light curves exhibiting long-timescale quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are analyzed within the framework of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) model, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, allowing us to constrain key physical parameters such as the jet Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$) and the viewing angle between the observer's line of sight ($\psi$) relative to the spin axis of SMBH.</description>

      <title>The ambiguous AT2022rze: Changing-look AGN mimicking a supernova in a merging galaxy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital alignment of highly inclined satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations $i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where $H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations ($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Variability in the massive black hole binary candidate SDSS J2320+0024: no evidence for periodic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, and they are expected to be among the loudest gravitational wave sources at low frequencies. SDSS J2320+0024 has been recently proposed as a promising MBHB candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light-curve and variability in the MgII emission line. In this work, we re-analyse the optical (g and r bands) light-curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection. When a periodicity is searched for together with red noise, the analysis of the g-band light-curve finds a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days. The posterior profile is too broad to result in a preference for the periodic models with respect to models including only red-noise. Furthermore, the same peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band light-curve. A periodic model without red-noise identifies a different (~1100 days) periodicity, and it is significantly statistically disfavoured with respect to the other tested models. In summary, no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal over red noise variability is found. Our analysis questions the robustness of the previously claimed periodicity and emphasizes the importance of rigorous statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis of the photometric light-curves and of the evolving broad line profiles can shed further light on the real nature of this object.</description>

      <title>On Pulsar Timing Detection of Ultralight Vector Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vector dark matter induces metric fluctuations that generate timing residuals in the arrival times of pulsar emissions through two distinct modes: a fast mode, sourced by coherent field oscillations, and a slow mode, arising from interference patterns. These modes enable the detection of vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m \sim 10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays. While previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full statistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its polarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from both modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight vector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states. The two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as direct tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic background in pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Violation with Gravitational Waves: Constraints from NANOGrav and IPTA Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{{LV}}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{{LV}} &gt; 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Modeling of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Essential Step Towards a Robust Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>A Be star-black hole binary with a wide orbit from LAMOST time-domain survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems consisting of an early type star and a black hole (BH) are crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, particularly the origins of detected gravitational wave sources. Be binary systems are expected to represent a key evolutionary stage in hosting BHs. However, while hundreds of Be X-ray binaries are known, the only confirmed BH candidate in a Be binary remains highly controversial. We report the discovery of ALS 8814, a Be star-BH binary with a moderately eccentric ($e = 0.23$) and wide orbit ($P = 176.6$ days), revealed by the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the visible Be star. Our analysis, combining flux-calibrated spectra in the Balmer discontinuity region and spectral template matching, yields a mass of $11.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$ $M_\odot$ for the Be star. The minimum mass of the unseen companion, assuming an edge-on inclination ($i = 90^{\circ}$), is $9.8\pm 0.7\,M_\odot$. We rule out the presence of non-degenerate companions in ALS 8814, indicating that it can only be a BH. This discovery represents a robust case of a Be-BH binary, identified purely through precise RV measurements from a single set of lines. The extremely low peculiar velocity of ALS 8814 suggests that the BH is formed via a direct core-collapse with a negligible natal kick, implying an almost perfect alignment between the Be star's spin and the orbital plane. In this context, the binary's inclination angle is estimated to be 22$^{\circ}$-49$^{\circ}$ by analyzing the shallow double-peaked profile of the H$\alpha$ emission line. This inclination range corresponds to a BH mass estimate between $15\,M_\odot$ and $58\,M_\odot$. As the only unambiguous Be-BH binary system known to date, ALS 8814 provides valuable constraints on the BH formation in a binary system with a high-mass companion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.</description>

      <title>Imaging a ring-like structure and the extended jet of M87 at 86 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy M87 is one of the prime targets for high resolution radio imaging to investigate the supermassive black hole, accretion flow, and relativistic jet. However, it remains challenging to observe them jointly. In 2018, GMVA+ALMA observations at 86 GHz enabled the simultaneous reconstruction of a ring structure and the extended jet emission. In order to analyze the ring and jet of M87, conventional 'CLEAN' algorithms were mainly employed alongside the RML method 'SMILI' in previous work. To test the robustness of the reconstructed structures of M87 GMVA+ALMA observations at 86 GHz, we estimate the ring diameter, width, and the extended jet emission with the possible central spine by two different novel imaging algorithms: 'resolve' and 'DoG-HiT'. Overall, reconstructions are consistent with the 'CLEAN' and 'SMILI' images. The ring structure of M87 is resolved at a higher resolution and the posterior distribution of M87 ring features is explored. The 'resolve' images show that the ring diameter is 60.9 +- 2.2 muas and its width is 16.0 +- 0.9 muas. The ring diameter and the ring width measured from the 'DoG-HiT' image are 61.0 muas and 20.6 muas, respectively. The ring diameter is therefore in agreement with the estimation in the previous work (64 +4 -8 muas). Two bright spots in the ring are reconstructed by four independent imaging methods. Therefore, the substructure in the ring most likely results from the data. A consistent limb-brightened jet structure is reconstructed by 'resolve' and 'DoG-HiT', albeit with a less pronounced central spine. Modern data-driven imaging methods confirm the ring and jet structure in M87, and complement traditional VLBI methods with novel perspectives on evaluating the significance of the recovered features. They confirm the result of the previous report.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the atomic lines' emission of fast moving pulsar nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bow shocks generated by pulsars moving through weakly ionized interstellar medium (ISM) produce emission dominated by non-equilibrium atomic transitions. These bow shocks are primarily observed as H$_\alpha$ nebulae. We developed a package, named Shu, that calculates non-LTE intensity maps in more than 150 spectral lines, taking into account geometrical properties of the pulsars' motion and lines of sight. We argue here that atomic (CI, NI, OI) and ionic (SII, NII, OIII, NeIV) transitions can be used as complementary and sensitive probes of ISM. We perform self-consistent 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of the bow shock structure and generate non-LTE emissivity maps, combining global dynamics of relativistic flows, and detailed calculations of the non-equilibrium ionization states. We find that though typically H$_\alpha$ emission is dominant, spectral fluxes in OIII, SII and NII may become comparable for relatively slowly moving pulsars. Overall, morphology of non-LTE emission, especially of the ionic species, is a sensitive probe of the density structures of the ISM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a solvable scenario for 3D reconnection in a sheared magnetic field. We consider a localized external force that is applied slowly to a flux tube and then maintained, generating an Alfv\'{e}nic perturbation that spreads along the field lines. Separation of the sheared field lines reduces the scale of the perturbation across the field, enhancing magnetic diffusion. For a fusion-motivated equilibrium with exponential field-line separation, we find a reconnection timescale proportional to $S/\ln S$ under magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and to $S^{1/3}$ for semicollisional electron-only reconnection, where $S$ is the Lundquist number of the perturbed flux tube. We generalize these results to arbitrary magnetic geometries, showing that the semicollisional case is geometry independent. Interestingly, we find that slower field-line separation yields an increased reconnection rate in MHD.</description>

      <title>AT 2018dyk: tidal disruption event or active galactic nucleus? Follow-up observations of an extreme coronal line emitter with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present fresh insights into the nature of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2018dyk. AT 2018dyk has sparked a debate in the literature around its classification as either a bona-fide TDE or as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on state change. A new follow-up spectrum taken with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, in combination with host-galaxy analysis using archival SDSS-MaNGA data, supports the identification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE. Specifically, we classify this object as a TDE that occurred within a gas-rich environment, which was responsible for both its mid-infrared (MIR) outburst and development of Fe coronal emission lines. Comparison with the known sample of TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs displaying coronal emission lines (CrL-TDEs) reveals similar characteristics and shared properties. For example, the MIR properties of both groups appear to form a continuum with links to the content and density of the material in their local environments. This includes evidence for a MIR colour-luminosity relationship in TDEs occurring within such gas-rich environments, with those with larger MIR outbursts also exhibiting redder peaks.</description>

Abstract: X-ray polarimetric observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE) is an excellent tool for probing the geometry and dynamics of X-ray emitting corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This work aims to investigate the geometry of the X-ray corona in the Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 2110, using its first polarimetric observation with IXPE, conducted over a net exposure of 554 ks beginning on October 16, 2024. We performed a model-independent analysis of the 2-8 keV IXPE polarimetric observation to estimate the polarization properties of NGC 2110. Furthermore, we performed spectral and spectro-polarimetric analyses combining IXPE data with archival observations from NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT to derive detailed spectral and polarization properties. From the spectro-polarimetric analyses, an upper limit on the polarization degree (PD) of 7.6% (at the 99% confidence) was estimated in the 2-8 keV band. The spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 5.66-8 keV band yielded a looser upper limit of 27% at the 99 % confidence. Comparing the measured polarization properties, coronal parameters, and inclination angle of NGC 2110 with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MONK) simulations suggest that the current polarization measurements lack the sensitivity to place definitive constraints on the coronal geometry. The upper limits on PD, as derived from our analysis at the 99% confidence level, indicate that polarization remains undetected at a statistically significant level. Consequently, we are unable to determine whether the corona is elongated along the disk or more compact and spherical. Future observations with improved sensitivity will be crucial to breaking these degeneracies and providing deeper insight into the coronal structure of NGC 2110.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter profiles in FIRE dwarfs: black holes, cosmic rays and the cusp-core enigma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies have historically posed challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model and, while many of the so-called 'dwarf galaxy problems' have been mitigated by incorporating baryonic processes, the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves remains a contentious topic. Meanwhile, the growing observational samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies have prompted a paradigm shift in our understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution, traditionally thought to be regulated by stellar feedback. In this study, we explore the potential role of AGN feedback in shaping dark matter distributions and increasing the diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves, using a new suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the FIRE-3 model. Our findings indicate that the presence of active black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can lead to diverse outcomes, ranging from cuspier to more core-like profiles. This variability arises from the dual role of BHs in providing additional feedback and regulating the extent of stellar feedback. Consistent with previous research, we find that AGN feedback is most impactful when cosmic ray (CR) modelling is included, with CRs from any source significantly influencing dark matter profiles. Overall, our results highlight that the interplay between stellar feedback, BHs, and CRs produces a broad spectrum of dark matter density profiles, which align with observed correlations between rotation curve shapes and baryonic dominance. This underscores the importance of including the full range of baryonic processes in dwarf galaxy simulations to address the persistent 'small-scale challenges' to the CDM paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4\,$s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ''partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant-sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>
