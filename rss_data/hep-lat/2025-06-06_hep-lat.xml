      <title>Gauge-invariant field strengths in $QCD$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-invariant field strengths, defined as parallel transports to infinity of ordinary field strengths, naturally emerge in a few physical phenomena governed by $QCD$. One of them is confinement of colour. Despite the arbitrariness in their definition coming from the freedom in the choice of the path of the parallel transport to infinity, the request of differentiability with respect to the position $x$ strongly constrains their correlation functions. Strong constraints also come from translation and Lorentz invariance. Gauge invariant field strengths also appear in the non abelian Stokes theorem, and allow to understand basic properties of the vacuum by use of lattice data.</description>

      <title>Mapping Parton Distributions of Hadrons with Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong force which binds hadrons is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Determining the character and manifestations of QCD is one of the most important and challenging outstanding issues necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the structure of hadrons. Within the context of the QCD parton picture, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) have been remarkably successful in describing a wide variety of processes. However, these PDFs have generally been confined to the description of collinear partons within the hadron. New experiments and facilities provide the opportunity to additionally explore the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, which can be described by generalized parton distributions (GPDs), for example. In recent years, a breakthrough was made in calculating the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs in lattice QCD by using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and other similar frameworks. The breakthrough has led to the emergence and rapid development of direct calculations of Bjorken-$x$--dependent structure. In this review article, we show some of the recent progress made in lattice QCD in PDFs and GPDs and discuss future challenges.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Weyl fermion on an axion string in a finite lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall fermions use a $2n$-dimensional spacetime defect embedded in $(2n+1)$-dimensional spacetime to realize massless lattice Dirac fermions. Recent work has extended this idea to realize a single unpaired Weyl fermion in a finite lattice. Here, we realize the same using a $2n$-dimensional string defect embedded in $(2n+2)$-dimensional spacetime on a finite lattice for $n=1$. This string is a lattice version of the continuum axion string described in Callan-Harvey. Our results are obtained in a Hamiltonian formulation in Minkowski spacetime. Extending the results to Euclidean spacetime and to $n&gt;1$ is straightforward. This work has applications to lattice chiral gauge theories and axion cosmology.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the sphaleron rate for first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many extensions of the Standard Model electroweak phase transitions at high temperatures can be described in a minimal dimensionally reduced effective theory with SU(2) gauge field and fundamental Higgs scalar. In this effective theory, all thermodynamic information is governed by two dimensionless ratios $x \equiv \lambda_3/g^2_3$ and $y\equiv m^2_3/g^4_3$, where $\lambda_3$, $m^2_3$ and $g_3$ are the effective thermal scalar self-interaction coupling, the thermal mass and the effective gauge-coupling, respectively. By using non-perturbative lattice simulations to determine the rate of sphaleron transitions in the entire $(x,y)$-plane corresponding to the Higgs phase, and by applying previous lattice results for the bubble nucleation, we find a condition $x(T_c) \lesssim 0.025$ to guarantee preservation of the baryon asymmetry, which translates to $v/T_c \equiv \sqrt{2 \langle \phi^\dagger \phi \rangle}/T_c \gtrsim 1.33$ for the (gauge-invariant) Higgs condensate. This indicates that viability of the electroweak baryogenesis requires the phase transition to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated. Finally, we present a general template for analysing such viability in a wide class of beyond the Standard Model theories, in which new fields are heavy enough to be integrated out at high temperature.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of the dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks [fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$] in this framework is also considered.</description>
