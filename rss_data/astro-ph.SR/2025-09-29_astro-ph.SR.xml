      <title>Dynamical Pathways to the Misalignment of the VHS 1256-1257 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</description>

      <title>Radio Stars in the Era of New Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An international conference Radio Stars in the Era of New Observatories was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory on 2024 April 17-19. The conference brought together more than 60 researchers from around the world, united by an interest in using radio wavelength observations to explore the physical processes that operate in stars (including the Sun), how stars evolve and interact with their environments, and the role of radio stars as probes of our Galaxy. Topics discussed at the meeting included radio emission from cool and ultracool dwarfs, extrasolar space weather, stellar masers, thermal radio emission from evolved stars, circumstellar chemistry, low frequency observations of the Sun, radio emission from hot stars, applications of very long baseline interferometry techniques to stellar astrophysics, stellar explosive events, the detection of radio stars in the latest generation of widefield sky surveys, the importance of radio stars for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and the anticipated applications for stellar astrophysics of future radio observatories on the ground and in space. This article summarizes research topics and results featured at the conference, along with some background and contextual information. It also highlights key outstanding questions in stellar astrophysics where new insights are anticipated from the next generation of observational facilities operating at meter through submillimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Temperatures of Flares on the M Dwarf Wolf 359 from Simultaneous Multiband Optical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flare temperature study of the highly active M~dwarf Wolf~359 using simultaneous multiband ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$) photometric observations from the Lulin 1-m and 41-cm telescopes. Twelve flares were detected over five nights, with significant brightness increases in the $u$, $g$, and $r$~bands; only three were seen in $i$, and none in $z$. From broadband SED fitting and $g$/$r$ color ratio, we derive an average flare temperature of $5500 \pm 1600$~K, significantly cooler than the canonical 10000~K. We obtained a power-law relation between FWHM flare temperature and energy in the solar-class flare regime and extrapolated it to higher energies, superflare regime. This power-law is consistent with the trends reported for M-dwarf superflares in previous studies, suggesting a common temperature-energy scaling across several orders of magnitude. However, the scatter in the superflare regime increases, indicating that such energetic events may involve more complex physical mechanisms and limiting the applicability of simple blackbody models at the high energy flares. Using our FWHM flare temperature--TRIPOL~$g$ energy relation and the reported flare energy frequency distribution of Wolf~359, we evaluated the potential flare contribution to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the habitable zone. We find that typical solar-class giant flares ($E_{\mathrm{fl,bol}} \sim 9\times10^{31}$~erg, $T_{\mathrm{fl,fwhm}} \sim 6800$~K) are {not frequent enough} to sustain Earth-like net primary productivity. Even under the extreme superflare condition ($\sim$$10^{36}$~erg, $\sim$16500~K), flare activity remains far from meeting the PAR threshold.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>HR6819: a puffed-up stripped star system challenging stable mass transfer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HR6819 is the first system with a puffed-up low mass stripped star and a classical Be star whose nature has been confirmed by optical interferometry. It shows the most extreme mass ratio (15.7 +/- 1.1), the lowest stripped star mass (0.270 +/- 0.056 Msun), and one of the shortest orbital periods (40.3266 +/- 0.0016 days) among similar post-interaction binaries. These properties make HR6819 a unique test case for binary interaction physics, in particular the efficiency of mass transfer onto the Be progenitor required to reach such an extreme mass ratio. We reconstruct the possible evolutionary history of the system with grids of MESA simulations spanning mass transfer efficiencies from fully to fifty percent conservative. We show that stable Roche lobe overflow cannot simultaneously reproduce the observed orbital period and extreme mass ratio: the maximum ratio achievable is ~11.5 at ~40 days, even in the fully conservative case. Furthermore, the observed luminosities of both components exceed those expected from their model masses; the luminosity of the stripped star would be consistent with a ~0.7 Msun mass, over twice its dynamical mass. Our results demonstrate that the post-interaction properties of HR6819 cannot be explained by stable mass transfer under standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the mass transfer flow in direct-impact accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a variety of visualization techniques to display the interior and surface flows in a double white dwarf binary undergoing direct-impact mass transfer and evolving dynamically to a merger. The structure of the flow can be interpreted in terms of standard dynamical, cyclostrophic and geostrophic arguments. We describe and showcase some visualization and analysis techniques of potential interest for astrophysical hydrodynamics. In the context of R Coronae Borealis stars, we find that mixing of accretor material with donor material at the shear layer between the fast accretion belt and the slower rotating accretor body will always result in some dredge-up. We also discuss briefly some potential applications to other types of binaries.</description>

      <title>A nearly pristine star from the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first stars formed out of pristine gas, causing them to be so massive that none are expected to have survived until today. If their direct descendants were sufficiently low-mass stars, they could exist today and would be recognizable by having the lowest metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium). The lowest metallicity star currently known is a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way with total metallicity Z &lt; 1.4 x 10^-6 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.0). While other stars with lower iron abundance have been discovered, they have high carbon abundances and thus higher total metallicities (log Z/Zsun &gt; -3). Here we present the discovery and detailed chemical analysis of the most metal-poor star yet found: the red giant star SDSS J0715-7334 with ultra-low abundances of both iron and carbon ([Fe/H]=-4.3, [C/Fe]&lt;-0.2), resulting in total metallicity Z &lt; 7.8 x 10^-7 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.3). This star has the most pristine composition of any object known in the universe. The star's orbit indicates that it originates from the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its detailed chemical composition implies a supernova progenitor with initial mass of 30 solar masses. Current models of low-mass star formation can explain the existence of SDSS J0715-7334 only if dust cooling was already able to operate at the time of its formation. SDSS J0715-7334 is over ten times more metal-poor than the most metal-poor high-redshift galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope, some of which have been claimed to be potentially metal-free. Substantially deeper observations of high-redshift galaxies would be needed to prove that they are truly pristine galaxies made of metal-free stars and not metal-enriched galaxies composed of second-generation stars like SDSS J0715-7334.</description>

      <title>MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) III. The White Dwarf Cooling Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a substantial update to the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) library, extending the MIST model grids and isochrones down the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence with realistic physics for WD cooling timescales. This work provides a large grid of MESA models for carbon-oxygen core WDs with hydrogen atmospheres (spectral type DA/DC), descended from full prior stellar evolution calculations. The model tracks, isochrones, and WD cooling timescale contours are available on the MIST project website and at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15242046. Our WD models provide a very large, publicly available grid with detailed physics for WD cooling timescales: realistic interior and envelope compositions, with element diffusion and heavy-element sedimentation, nuclear burning at the base of the WD hydrogen envelope, core crystallization, and C/O phase separation. As a large grid of open-source stellar evolution models, these WD models provide both out-of-the-box model tracks for comparison with observations and a framework for building further WD models to investigate variations in WD physics.</description>

      <title>Helium-burning blue large-amplitude pulsators: A Population Study with BPASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a class of radially pulsating stars with effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 to 35,000 K and pulsation periods between 7 and 75 minutes. This study utilizes the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code to investigate helium-burning stars as a formation channel for BLAPs in the Milky Way. The progenitor stars have initial masses of 3-6 $M_{\odot}$, resulting in BLAPs with final masses of 0.5-1.2 $M_{\odot}$. Based on a constant star formation rate of 3 $ M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ and solar metallicity (Z = 0.020), population synthesis predicts approximately 14,351 helium-burning BLAPs in the Milky Way: 12,799 with Main Sequence (MS) companions and 1,551 with evolved/compact-object companions. Helium-burning BLAPs show prolonged lifetimes in the pulsation region and a narrow stellar age range for entering this regime (log(t/yr) = 8.0-8.6), unlike pre-white dwarf models. BLAPs with MS companions typically form via Roche lobe overflow, leading to longer orbital periods ($\sim$100 days). Those with evolved/compact-object companions form through common envelope evolution, resulting in shorter periods. While Galactic extinction makes most BLAPs faint (apparent magnitudes $&gt;$ 25), future surveys like WFST and VRO LSST are expected to detect approximately 500-900. This research establishes helium-burning stars as a significant BLAP contributor and offers testable predictions regarding their binary properties and Galactic distribution.</description>

      <title>Low-mass companions to nine stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an independent spectroscopic and radial velocity analysis for nine stars from the Pennsylvania-Toru\'n Planet Search. For BD+24 4697, we present an updated true companion's mass (0.16$\pm$0.02 \, M$_{\odot}$), as well as evidence of stellar activity. For BD+54 1640 and BD+65 1241 we present true masses of companions, $m = 0.15 \pm 0.04\,M_\odot$ and $m = 0.091 \pm 0.005\,M_\odot$, respectively. For BD+63 974 and BD+69 935 we find low mass companions with $m \sin i = 0.046 \pm 0.001\,M_\odot$ and $m \sin i = 0.090 \pm 0.005\,M_\odot$. For BD+52 1281, BD+54 1382, TYC 2704-2680-1, and TYC 3525-02043-1 we present evidence of low-mass companions with $m \sin i$ of 0.115 $\pm 0.006\,M_\odot$, 0.083 $\pm 0.007\,M_\odot$, 0.279 $\pm 0.009\,M_\odot$, and $0.064 \pm 0.006\,M_\odot$, respectively. Consequently, BD+54 1382, BD+63 974, BD+65 1241, BD+69 935 and TYC 3525-02043-1 appear to be Brown Dwarf host candidates.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Large-scale Current Sheet under an Erupting Magnetic Flux Rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the acceleration and transport of electrons in the highly fine-structured current sheet that develops during magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruptions. Our work combines ultra-resolved MHD simulations of MFR eruption, with test-particle studies performed using the guiding center approximation. Our grid-adaptive, fully three-dimensional, high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations model MFR eruptions that form complex current sheet topologies, serving as background electromagnetic fields for particle acceleration. Within the current sheet, tearing-mode instabilities give rise to mini flux ropes. Electrons become temporarily trapped within these elongated structures, undergoing acceleration and transport processes that significantly differ from those observed in two-dimensional or two-and-a-half-dimensional simulations. Our findings reveal that these fine-scale structures act as efficient particle accelerators, surpassing the acceleration efficiency of single X-line reconnection events, and are capable of energizing electrons to energies exceeding 100 keV. High-energy electrons accelerated in different mini flux ropes follow distinct trajectories due to spatially varying magnetic field connectivity, ultimately precipitating onto opposite sides of flare ribbons. Remarkably, double electron sources at the flare ribbons originate from different small flux rope acceleration regions, rather than from the same reconnecting field line as previously suggested. Distinct small flux ropes possess opposite magnetic helicity to accelerate electrons to source regions with different magnetic polarities, establishing a novel conjugate double source configuration. Furthermore, electrons escaping from the lower regions exhibit a broken power-law energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>First direct detection of an RR Lyrae star conclusively associated with an intermediate-age cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered unequivocal tracers of old (&gt;10 Gyr) and metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-0.5$) stellar populations. First, because these populations are where they are readily found and because, according to canonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only populations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however, are challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct evidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these stars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and robust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically associated member stars from the Hunt &amp; Reffert database by crossmatching against a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys (\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV).
  We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of the 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions and their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low probability ($0.049\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae and provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its position in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of debate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of the existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally expected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.</description>

      <title>High Proper Motion Discoveries from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the third data release of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey to locate previously unrecognized high proper motion objects. We identify a total of 127 new discoveries with total proper motions $\gtrsim$300 mas yr$^{-1}$. A significant fraction of these sources with counterparts in the Gaia DR3 catalog are found to be distant ($&gt;$100 pc) low-mass stars, where their large tangential velocities and placement on color-magnitude diagrams suggest that they are likely low-metallicity M-type subdwarfs. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the low-mass and low-metallicity for two such sources. Using available optical and infrared photometry, we estimate the spectral type for all non-Gaia sources and find 10 likely late-M dwarfs, 15 objects with colors most consistent with L-type dwarfs, and 9 possible T-type dwarfs. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to confirm spectral types and further characterize these new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>Debris disks and their properties with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit on the Non-Gravitational Acceleration and Lower Limits on the Nucleus Mass and Diameter of 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm au\,d^{-2}}$. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of $3.3 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ and $5\,{\rm km}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only the high-energy tails, but also the low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.</description>

      <title>Extreme Geomagnetic Storm on Early Earth Induced by Corotating Interaction Regions from the Young Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multiwavelength observations of young solar analogs suggest that the young Sun in the first 600 Myr was a magnetically active star that produced an X-ray and Extreme-UV (EUV) bright corona, fast, massive stellar wind, and energetic eruptive events. These outputs affected magnetospheric environments of early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar wind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of early Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the response of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating deposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR shock from the young Sun. The model suggests ~ 40% closer dayside magnetopause standoff distance, and higher negative SYMH, Cross Polar Cap Potentials (CPCP), atmospheric Joule heating, Field Aligned Currents (FAC), electron precipitations, and equatorward polar cap expansions, comparable or exceeding those of recent intense and super geomagnetic storms. The magnetic storm produces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the stellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event are the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron precipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere. We discuss implications for the magnetospheric states and associated habitability conditions on early Earth and young rocky exoplanets around magnetically active solar-like stars.</description>

      <title>First results from ALPPS: a sub-Alfv\'enic streamer in SVS13A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the ALMA Perseus Polarization Survey (ALPPS), focusing on the magnetic field in the SVS13A circumbinary disk. The dataset includes full-Stokes dust continuum observations at $\sim0\farcs3$ and 870 $\mu$m, as well as molecular line emission from C$^{17}$O$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs3$, C$^{18}$O$(J=2 \rightarrow 1)$ at $\sim0\farcs2$, and DCN$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs1$ angular resolution. Our observations resolve both a previously identified dust spiral and an infalling streamer, capturing their spatial and kinematic structures. The streamer is traced from scales $&gt;300$ au down to the circumbinary disk. Using alignment measure (AM) maps and histograms that compare the orientations of the plane-of-sky magnetic field with local intensity and velocity gradients, we find that the AM distribution peaks at a value of 1. This AM peak strongly suggests alignment between the field and the dust total intensity emission, as well as between the field and the gas velocity, which in turn suggests grain alignment by magnetic fields. From our data, we derive a magnetic field strength, B$_{\mathrm{pos}} \sim 1.1 \pm 0.6$\, mG, and a kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of $0.5 \pm 0.4$, suggesting magnetic dominance. We also produced a map of the Alfv\'enic Mach number, finding $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} &lt; 1$ along the streamer, consistent with sub-Alfv\'enic infalling motions. Therefore, the field is likely facilitating the inflow of material from the envelope onto the disk by constraining movement across the field lines. This represents the first detection of a magnetically sub-Alfv\'enic infalling streamer in a protostellar system.</description>

      <title>When backgrounds become signals: neutrino interactions in xenon-based dark matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection dark matter experiments have proven to be compelling probes for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with both nuclei and atomic electrons, offering complementary information to accelerator and reactor-based neutrino experiments. Recently, the XENONnT and PandaX-4T collaborations reported the first evidence of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8\mathrm{B}$ solar neutrinos. Thanks to their excellent background rejection capabilities and distinctive signal signatures, dual-phase time projection chambers are also sensitive to $pp$ solar neutrinos via their elastic scattering off atomic electrons in the target material. Although this signal is subdominant within the Standard Model, it becomes significantly enhanced in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, offering a unique opportunity to probe new physics in the low-energy regime. While the precision of current neutrino measurements from dark matter detectors remains lower than that achieved by dedicated neutrino experiments, their sensitivity to the tau neutrino component of solar neutrinos helps complete the overall picture, especially when investigating flavor-dependent new physics effects.</description>

      <title>Starshades as technosignatures in direct imaging phase curves: Application to the Habitable Worlds Observatory targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A star's luminosity increases as it evolves along the Main Sequence (MS), which inevitably results in a higher surface temperature for planets in orbit around the star. Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue by installing artificial structures -- starshades -- which can reduce the radiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially detectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase curve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems targeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be tasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The starshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner Lagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase curve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet. The phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\sigma=10^{-11}$ single-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the target stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas. If the IWA can be reduced to 45 mas, the percentage of stars above the $1\sigma$ limit increases to 96.7%. With a sufficiently small IWA, HWO should be able to detect anomalies in light curves caused by starshades or similar highly-reflective surfaces -- which could serve as key indicators for technologically advanced civilizations.</description>

      <title>Engaging and Educating Eclipse Observers Through Workshops, Media, Planetarium shows and Citizen Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heliophysics Big Year was an extended year where major solar events engaged the public. It included two eclipses (annular on October 14, 2023 and total on April 8, 2024), plus solar max and the Parker Solar Probe perihelion December 24, 2024. After the eclipse of 2017, many millions more Americans planned to view the solar corona. We expanded our eclipse website with activities, citizen science projects, resources, training videos, equipment, and external links. We were the Southwest Regional Coordinator for Citizen CATE 2024 project, training the state coordinators and their teams with the equipment and procedures. We trained teachers at local, regional, national, and international workshops, providing eclipse viewing cards, lenses to make solar cup projectors, a safe viewing screen pattern, and access to the training materials. We made presentations to the media and hosted public events to demonstrate safe eclipse viewing techniques. HMNS hosted live viewing for the annular and total plus solstice and equinox events, reaching tens of thousands of people. HMNS also secured a grant to provide 100 eclipse viewing cards for every public school (8,800+) in Texas. We distributed another 57,000 eclipse viewers to teachers and the public. We appeared in media both in advance of the eclipses and as live commentators. The most lasting and impactful product was our planetarium show Totality, which was given away free and shown in various formats (flatscreen, fisheye, or prewarped). Over 180,000 views of the show and its animations have been documented. We continued to improve our space weather forecasting site, which correctly predicted the major solar storms of May 10-11 and October 8-10, 2024. In total, we reached nearly two million learners.</description>

Abstract: Small bodies exist in distinct populations within their planetary systems. These reservoir populations hold a range of compositions, which to first order are dependent on formation location relative to their star. We provide a general overview of the nature of the reservoirs that source exocomets, from the influence of the stellar environment through planetesimal formation to comparisons with Solar System populations. Once transitioned from a young protoplanetary disc to a debris disc, a star can expect to be rained with exocomets. While exocomets are predominantly detected to date at A-type stars, planetesimals plausibly exist across a range of stellar masses, based on exoplanet abundance, debris disc occurrence and white dwarf infall.</description>

Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we estimate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models. Finally, we note that detailed forward modeling will be needed to develop the full potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betel-buddy? Constraints on the dynamical companion to $\alpha$ Orionis from HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two independent analyses have asserted that the cause of the Long Secondary Period (LSP) observed in the variability spectrum of our nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Ori), is an as-yet undetected, low-mass binary companion dubbed $\alpha$ Ori B. In this paper, we present the results of a far-UV observational campaign using the STIS echelle spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at detecting spectral signatures of the companion. The four-quadrant tiling pattern and timing of the observations were optimized to isolate the companion, with observations taking place during a period of maximum angular and velocity separation between Betelgeuse and the putative companion. Spectral differencing between quadrants recovers no spectral features at the companion's velocity in excess of the background or Betelgeuse's chromosphere, i.e. a non-detection. Having determined that $\alpha$ Ori B is most likely a Young Stellar Object (YSO) thanks to constraints from a complementary X-ray campaign with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in a companion paper, comparison of our data against canonical spectra from YSOs in the ULLYSES database allows us to confidently exclude masses above $\gtrsim1.5M_\odot$ and companion continuum or line emission in excess of $\approx10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ angstrom$^{-1}$ in the FUV ($\approx1200-1700$ angstroms). Future observational campaigns aware of the LSP phase are needed to place deeper constraints on the spectroscopic nature of $\alpha$ Ori B.</description>

      <title>Eclipse timing variations in 7 post-common envelope binaries: an update on recent circumbinary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eclipsing, short-period post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) have been studied for several decades by eclipse timing variations (ETVs) which have been interpreted as being caused by circumbinary bodies. In this paper we report 355 new observations of 7 PECBs (HS0705+6700, NN Ser, NSVS 07826147, NSVS 14256825, NY Vir, QS Vir and RR Cae) and examine how the recent proposed models of these systems compare with our new observations. We find that none of the 18 recent models fit accurately with our data. We review alternative mechanisms of the ETVs, including magnetic effects, but conclude that they do not predict our results. Although we cannot exclude the presence of circumbinary bodies a combination of several mechanisms may be required to explain the observed ETVs.</description>

      <title>An Educational Guide for 2D Stellar Structure Calculations of Rapidly Rotating Stars using the ESTER code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Evolution STEllaire en Rotation (ESTER) code is the first 2D stellar structure code to be made open-source and freely available to the astronomy and astrophysics community. An important and novel advancement of this code is that it can reproduce the distorted shape and observable signatures (e.g., gravity darkening) of rapidly rotating stars. ESTER also calculates the steady-state large-scale flows within the star, namely their differential rotation and associated meridional circulation. In this report, we explore and document the physics implemented within version 1.1.0rc2 of the ESTER code, in a way that complements published descriptions. We illustrate this physics by plotting how stellar structure parameters vary through stellar interiors at a range of latitudes and at different angular velocities. We investigate how the thin convective envelopes of intermediate mass stars vary with latitude when rapidly rotating, becoming deeper and thicker near the equator. Simple comparisons of ESTER model predictions (e.g., central temperature and density, luminosity) with the output from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code [Paxton et al., 2010] shows generally good agreement. Additional comparisons provide important benchmarking and verification for ESTER as a comparatively young code. Finally, we provide a guide for installing and running the code on our local university cluster, aimed at helping students to begin work.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric/ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>

      <title>Innovative SiC ultraviolet instrumentation development with potential applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>SN 2023gpw: exploring the diversity and power sources of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our observations and analysis of SN 2023gpw, a hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova (SLSN II) with broad emission lines in its post-peak spectra. Unlike previously observed SLSNe II, its light curve suggests an abrupt drop during a solar conjunction between ~80 and ~180 d after the light-curve peak, possibly analogous to a normal hydrogen-rich supernova (SN). Spectra taken at and before the peak show hydrogen and helium `flash' emission lines attributed to early interaction with a dense confined circumstellar medium (CSM). A well-observed ultraviolet excess appears as these lines disappear, also as a result of CSM interaction. The blackbody photosphere expands roughly at the same velocity throughout the observations, indicating little or no bulk deceleration. This velocity is much higher than what is seen in spectral lines, suggesting asymmetry in the ejecta. The high total radiated energy ($\gtrsim9\times10^{50}$ erg) and aforementioned lack of bulk deceleration in SN 2023gpw are difficult to reconcile with a neutrino-driven SN simply combined with efficient conversion from kinetic energy to emission through interaction. This suggests an additional energy source such as a central engine. While magnetar-powered models qualitatively similar to SN 2023gpw exist, more modeling work is required to determine if they can reproduce the observed properties in combination with early interaction. The required energy might alternatively be provided by accretion onto a black hole created in the collapse of a massive progenitor star.</description>
