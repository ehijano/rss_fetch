      <title>Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) near air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. The results support a stable ionic double-layer distribution near the interface for both air-water and oil-water interface systems. Hydronium tends to reside in the topmost layer of the interface, while hydroxide with a slightly stronger interfacial stabilization free energy is enriched in the deeper interfacial layer. This double-layer distribution may help to understand the longstanding controversy about the interfacial acid-base nature.</description>

      <title>Coupling Molecular Density Functional Theory with Converged Selected Configuration Interaction Methods to Study Excited states in Aqueous Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first implementation of a coupling between advanced wave function theories and molecular density functional theory (MDFT). This method enables the modeling of solvent effect into quantum mechanical (QM) calculations by incorporating an electrostatic potential generated by solvent charges into the electronic Hamiltonian. Solvent charges are deduced from the spatially and angularly dependent solvent particle density. Such density is obtained through the minimization of the functional associated to the molecular mechanics (MM) Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the fluid particles. The introduced QM/MDFT framework belongs to QM/MM family of methods but its originality lies in the use of MDFT as the MM solver, offering two main advantages. Firstly, its functional formulation makes it competitive with respect to sampling-based molecular mechanics. Secondly, it preserves a molecular-level description lost in macroscopic continuum approaches. Excited states properties of water and formaldehyde molecules solvated into water have been computed at the selected configuration interaction (SCI) level. Excitation energies and dipole moment have been compared with experimental data and previous theoretical work. A key finding is that using the Hartree-Fock method to describe the solute allows for predicting the solvent charge around the ground-state with sufficient precision for the subsequent SCI calculations of excited-states. This significantly reduces the computational cost of the described procedure, paving the way for the study of more complex molecules.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>Chemical Interface Damping by Electrochemical Gold Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical interface damping is a change in the effective collision frequency of conduction band electrons in metal originating from a chemical change of the metal interface. In this work, we present in-situ ellipsometric measurements that reveal the chemical interface damping effect from electrochemical oxidation of single crystal and polycrystalline gold films. We observe an increase in collision frequency of up to 21 meV for single-crystalline gold. To compare to results obtained with thiols and metal-oxides on gold nanoparticles, we normalize the collision frequency by the electron mean free path to the surface of the structure. We show that electrochemical gold oxidation provides a stronger effect on collision frequency than these coatings. Similar ellipsometric experiments have previously been conducted to investigate the optical properties of gold oxide, but without taking chemical interface damping into account. The change in reflection from oxidation of gold was solely attributed to the oxide coating. We also show that the chemical interface damping effect saturates at a larger effective oxide thickness, which is attributed to the stabilization of the gold-oxide interface.</description>

      <title>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene's basal plane can function as a perfectly selective barrier permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can also chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition intensely explored in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers that in the case of proton transport motivate strategies to accelerate it, such as introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalising the lattice, but these can compromise other properties like ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field E~V nm-1 and charge carrier density n~10^14 cm-2 in double gated graphene allows decoupling proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current in our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness that enables proton-based logic-and-memory graphene devices with orders-of-magnitude on-off ratios. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n - a fundamentally different technique to study 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

Abstract: Reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED) are the two most important membrane technologies for water desalination and treatment. Their modes of operation and transport mechanisms are very different, but on a closer look also have many similarities. In this concise version of our tutorial review, we describe state-of-the-art theory for both processes, focusing on simple examples that are helpful for the non-specialist and useful for classroom teaching. Both processes are described by the solution (SF) theory which combines ion and water transport across membranes with chemical and mechanical equilibrium at membrane/solution interfaces. We present a derivation of SF theory based on force balances on water and ions and show how the various terms, convection, diffusion, and electromigration, are derived, and how solute partitioning is implemented. Finally, we demonstrate how SF theory accurately describes the osmosis experiment where water and ions are transported in opposite directions across a membrane.</description>

      <title>To Pair or not to Pair? Machine-Learned Explicitly-Correlated Electronic Structure for NaCl in Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extent of ion pairing in solution is an important phenomenon to rationalise transport and thermodynamic properties of electrolytes. A fundamental measure of this pairing is the potential of mean force (PMF) between solvated ions. The relative stabilities of the paired and solvent shared states in the PMF and the barrier between them are highly sensitive to the underlying potential energy surface. However direct application of accurate electronic structure methods is challenging, since long simulations are required. We develop wavefunction based machine learning potentials with the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and second order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory for the prototypical system of Na and Cl ions in water. We show both methods in agreement, predicting the paired and solvent shared states to have similar energies (within 0.2 kcal/mol). We also provide the same benchmarks for different DFT functionals as well as insight into the PMF based on simple analyses of the interactions in the system.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Valence Ionizations and Satellite Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon ionization of an atom or a molecule, another electron (or more) can be simultaneously excited. These concurrently generated states are called "satellites" (or shake-up transitions) as they appear in ionization spectra as higher-energy peaks with weaker intensity and larger width than the main peaks associated with single-particle ionizations. Satellites, which correspond to electronically excited states of the cationic species, are notoriously challenging to model using conventional single-reference methods due to their high excitation degree compared to the neutral reference state. This work reports 42 satellite transition energies and 58 valence ionization potentials of full configuration interaction (FCI) quality computed in small molecular systems. Following the protocol developed for the quest database [https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1517, V\'eril et al. Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.: Comput. Mol. Sci. 2021, 11, e1517], these reference energies are computed using the configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively (CIPSI) method. In addition, the accuracy of the well-known coupled-cluster (CC) hierarchy (CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) is gauged against these new accurate references. The performances of various approximations based on many-body Green's functions ($GW$, GF2, and $T$-matrix) for ionization potentials are also analyzed. Their limitations in correctly modeling satellite transitions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hybrid density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact exchange contributions are known to crucially affect electronic states, which in turn govern covalent bond formation and breaking in chemical species. Empirically averaging the exact exchange admixture over compositional degrees of freedom, hybrid density functional approximations have been widely successful, yet have fallen short to reach high level quantum chemistry accuracy, primarily due to delocalization errors. We propose to `adaptify` hybrid functionals by generating optimal admixture ratios of exact exchange on the fly, i.e. specifically for any chemical compound, using extremely data efficient quantum machine learning models that carry negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof based hybrid density functional (aPBE0) is shown to yield atomization energies with sufficient accuracy to effectively cure the infamous spin gap problem in open shell systems, such as carbenes. aPBE0 further improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in organic molecules drawn from the QM9 and QM7b data set. Obtained with aPBE0 in a large basis, we present a revision of the entire QM9 data set (revQM9) with an estimated quality vastly superior to the original containing on average, stronger covalent binding, larger band-gaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole-moments. While aPBE0 is applicable in the equilibrium regime, outstanding limitations include covalent bond dissociation when going beyond the Coulson-Fisher point.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Magnus Expansion and Fer Expansion Approaches Revisited to Investigate the Chemical Shift Anisotropy During the Triple Oscillating Field Technique Irradiation in Solid-State NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion schemes were introduced in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 2011 and 2006, respectively. Key features of the Floquet magnus expansion are its ability to account for the calculations developed in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space instead of an infinite-dimensional space within the Floquet theory as well as its use of its distinguishable function from other theories such as average Hamiltonian theory, Floquet theory, and Fer expansion, which facilitates the evaluation of the spin behavior in between the stroboscopic observation points. This article focuses on revisiting the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion approaches and applying both methods to calculate the effective Hamiltonians and propagators, which control the spin system evolution during the Triple Oscillating Field Technique radiation experiment (TOFU). The TOFU pulse sequence is an important technique that was shown to avoid the dipolar truncation problem and form a new basis for accurate distance measurement by solid-state NMR. We take advantage of the interaction frequencies and the time modulation arising from the TOFU pulse sequence allowing selective recoupling of specific terms in the Hamiltonian that fulfill determined specific conditions. The work presented unifies and generalizes existing results of the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansions and delivers illustrations of novel springs that boost previous applications that are based on the classical information. We believe that the revisited approaches of this work and the derived expressions can serve as useful information and numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, and open system quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>From latent dynamics to meaningful representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While representation learning has been central to the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a key problem remains in making the learned representations meaningful. For this, the typical approach is to regularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions. However, such priors are usually unavailable or are ad hoc. To deal with this, recent efforts have shifted towards leveraging the insights from physical principles to guide the learning process. In this spirit, we propose a purely dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of relying on predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics with a learnable transition density - a prior driven by statistical mechanics. We show this is a more natural constraint for representation learning in stochastic dynamical systems, with the crucial ability to uniquely identify the ground truth representation. We validate our framework for different systems including a real-world fluorescent DNA movie dataset. We show that our algorithm can uniquely identify orthogonal, isometric and meaningful latent representations.</description>

Abstract: Despite the simplicity of the water molecule, the kinetics of ice nucleation under natural conditions can be complex. We investigated spontaneously grown ice nuclei using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and found significant differences between the kinetics of ice formation through spontaneously formed and ideal nuclei. Since classical nucleation theory can only provide a good description of ice nucleation in ideal conditions, we propose a generalized nucleation theory that can better characterize the kinetics of ice crystal nucleation in general conditions. This study provides an explanation on why previous experimental and computational studies have yielded widely varying critical nucleation sizes.</description>
