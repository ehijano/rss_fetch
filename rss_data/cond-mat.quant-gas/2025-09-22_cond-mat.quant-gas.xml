      <title>Dynamics of quantized vortices under quasi-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of K\'arm\'an vortex streets and the creation of perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.</description>

      <title>Formation of Cavity-Polaritons via High-Order Van Hove Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polaritons formed by hybridizing particle-hole excitations of an insulating phase with a cavity photon at sub-gap frequencies, where absorption is suppressed. The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove singularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more a photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the singularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose to engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in order to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS. Ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer two-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap. Moreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms prevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state systems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our findings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for polariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Attractive Multidimensional Solitons in Trapping Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews theoretical advances on the formation and stabilization of multidimensional solitons in nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with attractive interactions, focusing on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear optics. While 1D solitons are generally stable, their 2D and 3D counterparts are prone to collapse. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this, including optical lattices, modulation of the nonlinearity via Feshbach resonance management, and Rabi coupling between hyperfine states. Other approaches involve competing nonlinearities and quantum corrections, such as Lee-Huang-Yang effects. Emphasis is placed on conditions enabling long-lived or fully stable solitons. Despite experimental feasibility, achieving robust stabilization remains challenging due to the intricate interplay of nonlinearities and external controls. The paper surveys collapse dynamics, stabilization strategies, and soliton existence based on key theoretical contributions.</description>

      <title>Exploring confinement transitions in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories with dipolar atoms beyond one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Bose-Hubbard models have been employed in the study of cold-atom systems with dipolar interactions. It is shown that, for a certain choice of the coupling parameters, there exists an integrable extended 3-site Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions. A Bethe ansatz procedure is developed to obtain expressions for the energy spectrum and eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian States and How to Measure It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.</description>
