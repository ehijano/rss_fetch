      <title>A Gluing Theorem For Collapsing Warped-QAC Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a gluing construction for collapsing warped-QAC (quasi-asymptotically-conical) Calabi-Yau manifolds in $\CC^{n+2}, n\geq 2$. This gluing theorem verifies a conjecture by Yang Li in \cite{li2019gluing} on the behavior of the warped QAC Calabi-Yau metrics on affine quadrics when two singular fibers of a holomorphic fibration go apart. We will also discuss a bubble tree structure for those collapsing warped-QAC Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>Learning on hexagonal structures and Monge-Amp\`ere operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dually flat statistical manifolds provide a rich toolbox for investigations around the learning process. We prove that such manifolds are Monge-Amp\`ere manifolds. Examples of such manifolds include the space of exponential probability distributions on finite sets and the Boltzmann manifolds. Our investigations of Boltzmann manifolds lead us to prove that Monge-Amp\`ere operators control learning methods for Boltzmann machines. Using local trivial fibrations (webs) we demonstrate that on such manifolds the webs are parallelizable and can be constructed using a generalisation of Ceva's theorem. Assuming that our domain satisfies certain axioms of 2D topological quantum field theory we show that locally the learning can be defined on hexagonal structures. This brings a new geometric perspective for defining the optimal learning process.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph is aiming to serve as a primary introduction to spectral networks, by presenting them and their many applications from the scope of geometry and mathematical physics in a unified way. We do not attempt to treat these two approaches separately but rather provide broad motivation and the necessary background to reach to the frontiers of this fast-evolving field of research, explaining simultaneously the relevant geometric and physical aspects. The targeted audience is researchers and advanced students from either a rather mathematical or physical oriented education who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity (QG) amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>

Abstract: We interpret the coupled Ding semistability and the reduced coupled uniform Ding stability of log Fano pairs in the notion of coupled stability thresholds and reduced coupled stability thresholds. As a corollary, we solve a modified version of the conjecture by Hultgren and Witt Nystr\"om for coupled K\"ahler--Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds.</description>

      <title>Coclosed $G_2$-structures on $\text{SU}(2)^2$-invariant cohomogeneity one manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two different $\text{SU}(2)^2$-invariant cohomogeneity one manifolds, one non-compact $M=\mathbb{R}^4 \times S^3$ and one compact $M=S^4 \times S^3$, and study the existence of coclosed $\text{SU}(2)^2$-invariant $G_2$-structures constructed from half-flat $\text{SU}(3)$-structures. For $\mathbb{R}^4 \times S^3$, we prove the existence of a family of coclosed (but not necessarily torsion-free) $G_2$-structures which is given by three smooth functions satisfying certain boundary conditions around the singular orbit and a non-zero parameter. Moreover, any coclosed $G_2$-structure constructed from a half-flat $\text{SU}(3)$-structure is in this family. For $S^4 \times S^3$, we prove that there are no $\text{SU}(2)^2$-invariant coclosed $G_2$-structures constructed from half-flat $\text{SU}(3)$-structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper will study a new quarter-symmetric non-metric connection on a generalized Riemannian manifold. It will determine the relations that the torsion tensor satisfies. The exterior derivative of the skew-symmetric part $F$ of basic tensor $G$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection coincides with that of skew-symmetric part $F$ with respect to quarter-symmetric non-metric connection, which implies that the even-dimensional manifold endowed with $F$ is symplectic manifold if and only if it is closed with respect to quarter-symmetric non-metric connection. The linearly independent curvature tensors of this connection and its dual connection are determined and the properties of these tensors are discussed. Finally, the condition is given that the connection should be dual symmetric.</description>

      <title>Existence of closed geodesics on certain non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold. Suppose $M$ contains a bounded, concave, connected open set $U$ with $C^0$ boundary and $M\setminus U$ is connected. We assume that either the relative homotopy set $\pi_1(M,M\setminus U)=0$ or the union of all the conjugate subgroups of the image of the homomorphism $\pi_1(M\setminus U)\rightarrow \pi_1(M)$ (induced by the inclusion $M\setminus U\hookrightarrow M$) is a proper subset of $\pi_1(M)$. (The first condition is equivalent to $\pi_1(M\setminus U)\rightarrow \pi_1(M)$ is surjective; the second condition is satisfied if the relative homology group $H_1(M,M\setminus U)\neq 0$.) Then there exists a non-trivial closed geodesic on $M$. This partially proves a conjecture of Chambers, Liokumovich, Nabutovsky and Rotman.</description>

Abstract: We start by taking the analytical approach to discuss how the minimizer of Yamabe functional provides constant scalar curvature and its relationship with the Sobolev Space $W^{1,2}.$ Then, after demonstrating the importance of the sphere $S^n$, with stereographic projection and dilation, we show that the minimizer of Yamabe functional on standard sphere is obtained from a standard round metric $\bar{g}$ by a conformal diffeomorphism, thus giving us the constraint $\lambda (M) &lt; \lambda(S^n),$ which leads us to the final theorem that the Yamabe problem is solvable when $\lambda(M) &lt; \lambda(S^n).$ For the proof of this theorem, we adopt the approach of Concentration-Compactness.</description>

      <title>New look at Milnor Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nature of exotic spheres from two novel perspectives, addressing the fundamental question: ``What makes an exotic sphere exotic?''
  First, we explore spherical T-duality in the context of $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over $\mathrm{S}^4$. We demonstrate that the distinct smooth structures of exotic spheres $\Sigma^7$ correspond to spherical T-dual pairs for 16 out of the 28 diffeomorphism classes of smooth structures on seven-dimensional homotopy spheres. Furthermore, we show that spherical T-dual pairs can be encoded in $\star$-diagrams. These diagrams impose equivalences that constrain their $\mathrm{S}^3$-invariant geometries.
  Second, we introduce homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7 \times \mathrm{S}^1$ and examine their complex structures using logarithmic transformations. This analysis links their smooth structures to the algebraic and topological invariants of Fano orbifolds. Additionally, we relate these constructions to the Homological Mirror Symmetry program and propose connections to the theory of topological modular forms, aiming to unify geometric topology, elliptic cohomology, and modular forms.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the bottom spectrum of Beltrami Laplacian on geometrically contractible Riemannian manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound, and then characterize the distribution of the scalar curvature when the equality holds. Moreover, we prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem if the manifold is the universal cover of a closed hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>Ollivier-Ricci curvature of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature in terms of graph parameters and an optimal assignment. Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting in an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to construct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our formulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with fewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail party graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and only if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. Furthermore, we present a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees positive Ricci curvature. We conclude this work by discussing the maximal number of vertices that a regular graph of fixed degree with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature can have.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of boundary using doubly stochastic scaling of Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting points on or near the boundary of a dataset sampled, potentially with noise, from a compact manifold with boundary. We extend recent advances in doubly stochastic scaling of the Gaussian heat kernel via Sinkhorn iterations to this setting. Our main contributions are: (a) deriving a characterization of the scaling factors for manifolds with boundary, (b) developing a boundary direction estimator, aimed at identifying boundary points, based on doubly stochastic kernel and local principal component analysis, and (c) demonstrating through simulations that the resulting estimates of the boundary points outperform the standard Gaussian kernel-based approach, particularly under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Ricci solitons on bounded pseudoconvex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ equipped with a complete $C^2$ K\"ahler metric $g$ such that the Ricci curvature is strictly negative outside a compact subset. We prove that if $g$ is a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton, then it is K\"ahler-Einstein. Several examples are given as applications.</description>
