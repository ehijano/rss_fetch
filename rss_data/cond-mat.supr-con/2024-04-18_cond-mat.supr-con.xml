      <title>Phase sensitive information from a planar Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze both the general symmetry-related and more microscopic considerations that govern the Josephson tunneling across a finite planar junction between a known $s$-wave superconductor and a candidate unconventional superconductor (e.g., $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). Due to the finite size of the probe, the Josephson current possesses an edge contribution, which is shown to be the dominant contribution under certain conditions. Thus, the dependence of the edge contribution on the geometry of the junction can serve as a direct probe of the symmetry of the order parameter in the unconventional superconductor.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium finite frequency resonances in differential quantum noise driven by Majorana interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium quantum noise $S^&gt;(\omega,V)$ measured at finite frequencies $\omega$ and bias voltages $V$ probes Majorana bound states in a host nanostructure via fluctuation fingerprints unavailable in average currents or static shot noise. When Majorana interference is brought into play, it enriches nonequilibrium states and makes their nature even more unique. Here we demonstrate that an interference of two Majorana modes via a nonequilibrium quantum dot gives rise to a remarkable finite frequency response of the differential quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;(\omega,V,\Delta\phi)/\partial V$ driven by the Majorana phase difference $\Delta\phi$. Specifically, at low bias voltages there develops a narrow resonance of width $\hbar\Delta\omega\sim\sin^2\Delta\phi$ at a finite frequency determined by $V$, whereas for high bias voltages there arise two antiresonances at two finite frequencies controlled by both $V$ and $\Delta\phi$. We show that the maximum and minimum of these resonance and antiresonances have universal fractional values, $3e^3/4h$ and $-e^3/4h$. Moreover, detecting the frequencies of the antiresonances provides a potential tool to measure $\Delta\phi$ in nonequilibrium experiments on Majorana finite frequency quantum noise.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Eliashberg theory for systems with electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction: a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the validity of Eliashberg theory for the cases of fermions interacting with an Einstein phonon and with soft nematic fluctuations near an Ising-nematic/Ising-ferromagnetic quantum-critical point (QCP). In both cases, Eliashberg theory is obtained by neglecting vertex corrections. For the phonon case, the reasoning to neglect vertex corrections is the Migdal ``fast electron/slow boson'' argument because the phonon velocity is much smaller than the Fermi velocity, $v_F$. The same argument allows one to compute the fermionic self-energy within Eliashberg theory perturbatively rather than self-consistently. For the nematic case, the velocity of a collective boson is comparable to $v_F$ and this argument apparently does not work. Nonetheless, we argue that while two-loop vertex corrections near a nematic QCP are not small parametrically, they are small numerically. At the same time, perturbative calculation of the fermionic self-energy can be rigorously justified when the fermion-boson coupling is small compared to the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we argue that for the electron-phonon case Eliashberg theory breaks down at some distance from where the dressed Debye frequency would vanish, while for the nematic case it holds all the way to a QCP. From this perspective, Eliashberg theory for the nematic case actually works better than for the electron-phonon case.</description>

      <title>Pair density waves in the strong-coupling two-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model: a variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</description>

      <title>Vortex motion in reconfigurable three-dimensional superconducting nanoarchitectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When materials are patterned in three dimensions, there exist opportunities to tailor and create functionalities associated with an increase in complexity, the breaking of symmetries, and the introduction of curvature and non-trivial topologies. For superconducting nanostructures, the extension to the third dimension may trigger the emergence of new physical phenomena, as well as advances in technologies. Here, we harness three-dimensional (3D) nanopatterning to fabricate and control the emergent properties of a 3D superconducting nanostructure. Not only are we able to demonstrate the existence and motion of superconducting vortices in 3D but, with simulations, we show that the confinement leads to a well-defined bending of the vortices within the volume of the structure. Moreover, we experimentally observe a strong geometrical anisotropy of the critical field, through which we achieve the reconfigurable coexistence of superconducting and normal states in our 3D superconducting architecture, and the local definition of weak links. In this way, we uncover an intermediate regime of nanosuperconductivity, where the vortex state is truly three-dimensional and can be designed and manipulated by geometrical confinement. This insight into the influence of 3D geometries on superconducting properties offers a route to local reconfigurable control for future computing devices, sensors, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane chains of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space. Increasing the coupling between neighboring units gradually degrades their individual spin-1 character and leads to a trivial dimerized phase.</description>

      <title>Second Dome of Superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence is growing that a second dome of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity can be accessed in the cuprates by increasing the doping beyond the first dome. Here we use \emph{ab initio} methods without invoking any free parameters, such as the Hubbard $U$, to reveal that pressure could turn YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ into an ideal candidate for second-dome-superconductivity, displaying the predicted signature of strongly hybridized $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Notably, pressure is found to induce a phase transition replacing the antiferromagnetic phases with an orbitally-degenerate $d$--$d$ phase. Our study suggests that the origin of the second dome is correlated with the oxygen-hole fraction in the CuO$_2$ planes and the collapse of the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <title>From non-metal to strange metal at the stripe-percolation transition in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the normal state of cuprate superconductors continues to stimulate considerable speculation. Of particular interest has been the linear temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity in the low-temperature limit, which violates the prediction for a Fermi liquid. We present measurements of anisotropic resistivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ that confirm the strange-metal behavior for crystals with doped-hole concentration $p=x &gt; p^\ast \sim 0.19$ and contrast with the non-metallic behavior for $p&lt;p^\ast$. We propose that the changes at $p^\ast$ are associated with a first-order transition from doped Mott insulator to conventional metal; the transition appears as a crossover due to intrinsic dopant disorder. We consider results from the literature that support this picture; in particular, we present a simulation of the impact of the disorder on the first-order transition and the doping dependence of stripe correlations. Below $p^\ast$, the strong electronic interactions result in charge and spin stripe correlations that percolate across the CuO$_2$ planes; above $p^\ast$, residual stripe correlations are restricted to isolated puddles. We suggest that the $T$-linear resistivity results from scattering of quasiparticles from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations within the correlated puddles. This is a modest effect compared to the case at $p&lt;p^\ast$, where there data suggest that there are no coherent quasiparticles in the normal state.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity with zero-resistance and strange metal behavior in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently signatures of superconductivity were observed close to 80 K in \LN\ under pressure. This discovery positions \LN\ as the first bulk nickelate with high-temperature superconductivity, but the lack of zero resistance presents a significant drawback for validating the findings. Here we report pressure measurements up to over 30 GPa using a liquid pressure medium and show that single crystals of \LNO\ do exhibit zero resistance. We find that \LNO\ remains metallic under applied pressures, suggesting the absence of a metal-insulator transition proximate to the superconductivity. Analysis of the normal state $T$-linear resistance suggests an intricate link between this strange metal behaviour and superconductivity, whereby at high pressures both the linear resistance coefficient and superconducting transition are slowly suppressed by pressure, while at intermediate pressures both the superconductivity and strange metal behaviour appear disrupted, possibly due to a nearby structural instability. The association between strange metal behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity is very much in line with diverse classes of unconventional superconductors, including the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors. Understanding the superconductivity of \LNO\ evidently requires further revealing the interplay of strange metal behaviour, superconductivity, as well as possible competing electronic or structural phases.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in thin films under an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here, a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.</description>
