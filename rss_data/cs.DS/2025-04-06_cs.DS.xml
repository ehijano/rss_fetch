      <title>An Extended Symbolic-Arithmetic Model for Teaching Double-Black Removal with Rotation in Red-Black Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-black (DB) nodes have no place in red-black (RB) trees. So when DB nodes are formed, they are immediately removed. The removal of DB nodes that cause rotation and recoloring of other connected nodes poses greater challenges in the teaching and learning of RB trees. To ease this difficulty, this paper extends our previous work on the symbolic arithmetic algebraic (SA) method for removing DB nodes. The SA operations that are given as, Red + Black = Black; Black - Black = Red; Black + Black = DB; and DB - Black = Black removes DB nodes and rebalances black heights in RB trees. By extension, this paper projects three SA mathematical equations, namely, general symbolic arithmetic rule; partial symbolic arithmetic rule1; and partial symbolic arithmetic rule2. The removal of a DB node ultimately affects black heights in RB trees. To balance black heights using the SA equations, all the RB tree cases, namely, LR, RL, LL, and RR, were considered in this work; and the position of the nodes connected directly or indirectly to the DB node was also tested. In this study, to balance a RB tree, the issues considered w.r.t. the different cases of the RB tree were i) whether a DB node has an inner, outer, or both inner and outer black nephews; or ii) whether a DB node has an inner, outer or both inner and outer red nephews. The nephews r and x in this work are the children of the sibling s to a DB, and further up the tree, the parent p of a DB is their grandparent g. Thus, r and x have indirect relationships to a DB at the point of formation of the DB node. The novelty of the SA equations is in their effectiveness in the removal of DB that involves rotation of nodes as well as the recoloring of nodes along any simple path so as to balance black heights in a tree.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Binary Tree Mechanism for Differentially Private Approximation of All-Pair Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating all-pair distances in a weighted undirected graph with differential privacy, introduced by Sealfon [Sea16]. Given a publicly known undirected graph, we treat the weights of edges as sensitive information, and two graphs are neighbors if their edge weights differ in one edge by at most one. We obtain efficient algorithms with significantly improved bounds on a broad class of graphs which we refer to as \textit{recursively separable}. In particular, for any $n$-vertex $K_h$-minor-free graph, our algorithm achieve an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(h(nW)^{1/3} ) $, where $ W $ represents the maximum edge weight; For grid graphs, the same algorithmic scheme achieve additive error of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4}\sqrt{W})$.
  Our approach can be seen as a generalization of the celebrated binary tree mechanism for range queries, as releasing range queries is equivalent to computing all-pair distances on a path graph. In essence, our approach is based on generalizing the binary tree mechanism to graphs that are \textit{recursively separable}.</description>

      <title>Improved Circular Dictionary Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular dictionary matching problem is an extension of the classical dictionary matching problem where every string in the dictionary is interpreted as a circular string: after reading the last character of a string, we can move back to its first character. The circular dictionary matching problem is motivated by applications in bioinformatics and computational geometry.
  In 2011, Hon et al. [ISAAC 2011] showed how to efficiently solve circular dictionary matching queries within compressed space by building on Mantaci et al.'s eBWT and Sadakane's compressed suffix tree. The proposed solution is based on the assumption that the strings in the dictionary are all distinct and non-periodic, no string is a circular rotation of some other string, and the strings in the dictionary have similar lengths.
  In this paper, we consider arbitrary dictionaries, and we show how to solve circular dictionary matching queries in $ O((m + occ) \log n) $ time within compressed space using $ n \log \sigma (1 + o(1)) + O(n) + O(d \log n) $ bits, where $ n $ is the total length of the dictionary, $ m $ is the length of the pattern, $ occ $ is the number of occurrences, $ d $ is the number of strings in the dictionary and $ \sigma $ is the size of the alphabet. Our solution is based on an extension of the suffix array to arbitrary dictionaries and a sampling mechanism for the LCP array of a dictionary inspired by recent results in graph indexing and compression.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing on Random Regular Graphs beyond Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardcore model is a fundamental probabilistic model extensively studied in statistical physics, probability theory, and computer science. For graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, a well-known computational phase transition occurs at the tree-uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) = \frac{(\Delta-1)^{\Delta-1}}{(\Delta-2)^\Delta}$, where the mixing behavior of the Glauber dynamics (a simple Markov chain) undergoes a sharp transition.
  It is conjectured that random regular graphs exhibit different mixing behavior, with the slowdown occurring far beyond the uniqueness threshold. We confirm this conjecture by showing that, for the hardcore model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs, the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly with high probability when $\lambda = O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$, which is significantly beyond the uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) \approx e/\Delta$. Our result establishes a sharp distinction between the hardcore model on worst-case and beyond-worst-case instances, showing that the worst-case and average-case complexities of sampling and counting are fundamentally different.
  This result of rapid mixing on random instances follows from a new criterion we establish for rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for any distribution supported on a downward closed set family. Our criterion is simple, general, and easy to check. In addition to proving new mixing conditions for the hardcore model, we also establish improved mixing time bounds for sampling uniform matchings or $b$ matchings on graphs, the random cluster model on matroids with $q \in [0,1)$, and the determinantal point process. Our proof of this new criterion for rapid mixing combines and generalizes several recent tools in a novel way, including a trickle down theorem for field dynamics, spectral/entropic stability, and a new comparison result between field dynamics and Glauber dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Search for Clustering in Almost-linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first \emph{local search} algorithm for Euclidean clustering that attains an $O(1)$-approximation in almost-linear time. Specifically, for Euclidean $k$-Means, our algorithm achieves an $O(c)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(n^{1 + 1 / c})$ time, for any constant $c \ge 1$, maintaining the same running time as the previous (non-local-search-based) approach [la Tour and Saulpic, arXiv'2407.11217] while improving the approximation factor from $O(c^{6})$ to $O(c)$. The algorithm generalizes to any metric space with sparse spanners, delivering efficient constant approximation in $\ell_p$ metrics, doubling metrics, Jaccard metrics, etc.
  This generality derives from our main technical contribution: a local search algorithm on general graphs that obtains an $O(1)$-approximation in almost-linear time. We establish this through a new $1$-swap local search framework featuring a novel swap selection rule. At a high level, this rule ``scores'' every possible swap, based on both its modification to the clustering and its improvement to the clustering objective, and then selects those high-scoring swaps. To implement this, we design a new data structure for maintaining approximate nearest neighbors with amortized guarantees tailored to our framework.</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Isometric Embeddings of Hamming Metric into Edit Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A function $\varphi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^N$ is called an isometric embedding of the $n$-dimensional Hamming metric space to the $N$-dimensional edit metric space if, for all $x, y \in \{0,1\}^n$, the Hamming distance between $x$ and $y$ is equal to the edit distance between $\varphi(x)$ and $\varphi(y)$. The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio $n/N$. It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$. However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
  In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
  We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding $\varphi:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^N$ can have rate greater than 15/32 for all positive integers $n$. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover fundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric embedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over larger alphabets.
  Finally, we consider embeddings $\varphi:\Sigma_{\text{in}}^n\to \Sigma_{\text{out}}^N$ between different input and output alphabets, where the rate is given by $\frac{n\log|\Sigma_{\text{in}}|}{N\log|\Sigma_{\text{out}}|}$. In this setting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search with In-Place Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity is typically characterized in terms of XOR queries |x,y&gt; to |x,y+f(x)&gt; or phase queries, which ensure that even queries to non-invertible functions are unitary. When querying a permutation, another natural model is unitary: in-place queries |x&gt; to |f(x)&gt;.
  Some problems are known to require exponentially fewer in-place queries than XOR queries, but no separation has been shown in the opposite direction. A candidate for such a separation was the problem of inverting a permutation over N elements. This task, equivalent to unstructured search in the context of permutations, is solvable with $O(\sqrt{N})$ XOR queries but was conjectured to require $\Omega(N)$ in-place queries.
  We refute this conjecture by designing a quantum algorithm for Permutation Inversion using $O(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Our algorithm achieves the same speedup as Grover's algorithm despite the inability to efficiently uncompute queries or perform straightforward oracle-controlled reflections.
  Nonetheless, we show that there are indeed problems which require fewer XOR queries than in-place queries. We introduce a subspace-conversion problem called Function Erasure that requires 1 XOR query and $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Then, we build on a recent extension of the quantum adversary method to characterize exact conditions for a decision problem to exhibit such a separation, and we propose a candidate problem.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Sparsity Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a novel approach to solving the sparsity-constrained Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCONMF) problem, which requires decomposing a non-negative data matrix into the product of two lower-rank non-negative matrices, X=WH, where the mixing matrix H has orthogonal rows HH^T=I, while also satisfying an upper bound on the number of nonzero elements in each row. By reformulating SCONMF as a capacity-constrained facility-location problem (CCFLP), the proposed method naturally integrates non-negativity, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints. Specifically, our approach integrates control-barrier function (CBF) based framework used for dynamic optimal control design problems with maximum-entropy-principle-based framework used for facility location problems to enforce these constraints while ensuring robust factorization. Additionally, this work introduces a quantitative approach for determining the ``true" rank of W or H, equivalent to the number of ``true" features - a critical aspect in ONMF applications where the number of features is unknown. Simulations on various datasets demonstrate significantly improved factorizations with low reconstruction errors (as small as by 150 times) while strictly satisfying all constraints, outperforming existing methods that struggle with balancing accuracy and constraint adherence.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time Gap-ETH-Tight Approximation Scheme for Euclidean TSP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is among the oldest and most famous NP-hard optimization problems. In breakthrough works, Arora [J. ACM 1998] and Mitchell [SICOMP 1999] gave the first polynomial time approximation schemes. To improve the running time, Rao and Smith [STOC 1998] gave a randomized $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}\cdot n\log n$ time approximation scheme. Bartal and Gottlieb [FOCS 2013] gave a randomized approximation scheme in $2^{(1/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}} n$ time, which is linear in $n$. Recently, Kisfaludi-Bak, Nederlof, and W\k{e}grzycki [FOCS 2021] gave a randomized approximation scheme in $2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n \log n$ time, achieving a Gap-ETH tight dependence on $\varepsilon$. It is raised as a challenging open question by Kisfaludi-Bak, Nederlof, and W\k{e}grzycki [FOCS 2021] whether a running time of $2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}n$ is achievable. We answer their question positively by giving a randomized $2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n$ time approximation scheme for Euclidean TSP.</description>

      <title>Sampling permutations satisfying constraints within the lopsided local lemma regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling a random permutation with restricted positions, or equivalently approximating the permanent of a 0-1 matrix, is a fundamental problem in computer science, with several notable results achieved over the years. However, existing algorithms typically exhibit high computational complexity. Achieving the optimal running time remains elusive, even for nontrivial subsets of the problem. Furthermore, existing algorithms primarily focus on a {single} permutation, leaving many combinatorial problems involving {multiple} constrained permutations unaddressed.
  For a single permutation, we achieve the optimal running time $O(n^2)$ for approximating the permanent of a very dense $n \times n$ 0-1 matrix, where each row and column contains at most $\sqrt{(n-2)/20}$ zeros. This result serves as a fundamental building block in our sampling algorithm for multiple permutations.
  We further introduce a general model called {permutations with disjunctive constraints} (PDC) for handling multiple constrained permutations. We propose a novel Markov chain-based algorithm for sampling nearly uniform solutions of PDC within a lopsided Lov{\'a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) regime. For uniform PDC formulas, where all constraints are of the same width and all permutations are of the same size, our algorithm runs in nearly linear time with respect to the number of variables.
  Previous approaches for sampling LLL relied on the variable model. In contrast, the sampling problem of PDC encounters a fundamental challenge: the random variables within each permutation in the joint probability space are {not} mutually independent, leading to long-range correlations. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel sampling framework called {correlated factorization} and a new concept in the path coupling analysis, termed the {inactive vertex}.</description>

      <title>A Faster Algorithm for Maximum Weight Matching on Unrestricted Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a weighted bipartite graph $G = (L, R, E, w)$, the maximum weight matching (MWM) problem seeks to find a matching $M \subseteq E$ that maximizes the total weight $\sum_{e \in M} w(e)$.
  This paper presents a novel algorithm with a time complexity of $O(\min(X^3 + E, XE + X^2\log X))$, where $X = \min(|L|, |R|)$. Unlike many existing algorithms, our approach supports real-valued weights without additional constraints. Under this condition, our result improves upon the previous best-known bound of $O(VE + V^2\log V)$, or more strictly $O(XE + XV\log V)$, where $V = L \cup R$.
  The suggested implementation code is simplified and publicly available at https://github.com/ShawxingKwok/Kwok-algorithm, with the average-case time complexity of $O(E^{1.4} + LR)$ estimated from experimental results on random graphs.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Data Structures for Nearest Neighbor in Ultra High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric data structures have been extensively studied in the regime where the dimension is much smaller than the number of input points. But in many scenarios in Machine Learning, the dimension can be much higher than the number of points and can be so high that the data structure might be unable to read and store all coordinates of the input and query points.
  Inspired by these scenarios and related studies in feature selection and explainable clustering, we initiate the study of geometric data structures in this ultra-high dimensional regime. Our focus is the {\em approximate nearest neighbor} problem.
  In this problem, we are given a set of $n$ points $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and have to produce a {\em small} data structure that can {\em quickly} answer the following query: given $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$, return a point $c\in C$ that is approximately nearest to $q$.
  The main question in this paper is: {\em Is there a data structure with sublinear ($o(nd)$) space and sublinear ($o(d)$) query time when $d\gg n$?} In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation data structures with the following guarantees. For $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norm distances: $\tilde O(n \log(d)/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ space and $\tilde O(n/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ query time. We show that these space and time bounds are tight up to $\mathrm{poly}{(\log n/\epsilon)}$ factors. For $\ell_p$-norm distances: $\tilde O(n^2 \log(d) (\log\log (n)/\epsilon)^p)$ space and $\tilde O\left(n(\log\log (n)/\epsilon)^p\right)$ query time.
  Via simple reductions, our data structures imply sublinear-in-$d$ data structures for some other geometric problems; e.g. approximate orthogonal range search, furthest neighbor, and give rise to a sublinear $O(1)$-approximate representation of $k$-median and $k$-means clustering.</description>
