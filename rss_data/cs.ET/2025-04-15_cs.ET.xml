      <title>A Fully Planar Approach to Field-coupled Nanocomputing: Scalable Placement and Routing Without Wire Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a class of promising post-CMOS technologies that transmit information through electric or magnetic fields instead of current flow. They utilize basic building blocks called cells, which can form gates that implement Boolean functions. However, the design constraints for FCN circuits differ significantly from those for CMOS. One major challenge is that wires in FCN have to be realized as gates, i.e., they are constructed from cells and incur the same costs as gates. Additionally, all FCN technologies are fabricated on a single layer, e.g., a silicon surface, requiring all elements -- gates and wires -- to be placed within that same layer. Consequently, FCN employs special gates, called wire crossings, to enable signals to cross. While existing wire-crossing implementations are complex and were previously considered costly, initial efforts have aimed at minimizing their use. However, recent physical simulations and experiments on a quantum annealing platform have shown that currently used wire crossings in FCN significantly compromise signal stability, to the extent that circuits cannot function reliably. This work addresses that issue by introducing the first placement and routing algorithm that produces fully planar FCN circuits, eliminating the need for all wire crossings. For a comparative evaluation, a state-of-the-art placement and routing algorithm was also modified to enforce planarity. However, our proposed algorithm is more scalable and can handle inputs with up to 149k gates, enabling it to process circuits that are 182x more complex than those handled by the modified state-of-the-art algorithm.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Reversible Logic with HKI Superconducting Inductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers developed about a dozen semiconductor reversible (or adiabatic) logic chips since the early 1990s, validating circuit designs and proving the concept--but scale up required a further advance. This document shows that cryogenic inductors made of a new High Kinetic Inductance (HKI) material provide the advance. This material can be deposited as an integrated circuit layer, where it has enough energy recycling capacity to power a reversible circuit of the same size. This allows a designer to replicate and scale a complete reversible logic subsystem in accordance with Moore's law.</description>

      <title>Solar-charge your car: EV charging can be aligned with renewables by providing pro-environmental information on a smartboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of electric vehicle (EV) charging with renewable energy sources is crucial for minimizing the carbon footprint of transportation. This study investigates whether real-time pro-environmental information displayed on a smartboard at EV charging stations can influence drivers to align their charging behavior with periods of high renewable energy availability. A pre-post-control quasi-experimental field trial was conducted in a sustainable neighborhood in Ghent, Belgium. A smartboard provided real-time signals indicating optimal charging times based on renewable energy production. The results demonstrate that the presence of real-time pro-environmental information on a smartboard was associated with significant increases in both the number of charging operations and the amount of energy charged during periods of high renewable energy availability. This approach offers a scalable, cost-effective method for optimizing energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in residential settings.</description>

      <title>A Full Spectrum of 3D Ferroelectric Memory Architectures Shaped by Polarization Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric memories have attracted significant interest due to their non-volatile storage, energy efficiency, and fast operation, making them prime candidates for future memory technologies. As commercial Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and NAND flash memory are transiting or have moved toward three-dimensional (3D) integration, 3D ferroelectric memory architectures are also emerging, provided they can achieve a competitive position within the modern memory hierarchy. Given the excellent scalability of ferroelectric HfO2, various dense 3D integrated ferroelectric memory architectures are feasible, each offering unique strengths and facing distinct challenges. In this work, we present a comprehensive classification of 3D ferroelectric memory architectures based on polarization sensing methods, highlighting their critical role in shaping memory cell design and operational efficiency. Through a systematic evaluation of these architectures, we develop a unified framework to assess their advantages and trade-offs. This classification not only enhances the understanding of current 3D ferroelectric memory technologies but also lays the foundation for designing next-generation architectures optimized for advanced computing and high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data (text, images, videos) into retrieval and generation processes, overcoming the limitations of text-only Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>Exponential Shift: Humans Adapt to AI Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are transforming the global labor market. Human workers, limited to a 33% duty cycle due to rest and holidays, cost $14 to $55 per hour. In contrast, digital labor operates nearly 24/7 at just $0.10 to $0.50 per hour. We examine sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail, finding that 40-70% of tasks could be automated. Yet, human skills like emotional intelligence and adaptability remain essential. Humans process 5,000-20,000 tokens (units of information) per hour, while AI far exceeds this, though its energy use-3.5 to 7 times higher than humans-could offset 20-40% of cost savings. Using real-world examples, such as AI in journalism and law, we illustrate these dynamics and propose six strategies-like a 4-day workweek and retraining-to ensure a fair transition to an AI-driven economy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way we operate our society and will undoubtedly impact power systems as well - but how exactly? By integrating various data streams - including real-time grid data, market dynamics, and consumer behaviors - LLMs have the potential to make power system operations more adaptive, enhance proactive security measures, and deliver personalized energy services. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 30 real-world applications across eight key categories: Grid Operations and Management, Energy Markets and Trading, Personalized Energy Management and Customer Engagement, Grid Planning and Education, Grid Security and Compliance, Advanced Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery, Emerging Applications and Societal Impact, and LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning. Critical technical hurdles, such as data privacy and model reliability, are examined, along with possible solutions. Ultimately, this review illustrates how LLMs can significantly contribute to building more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy infrastructures, underscoring the necessity of their responsible and equitable deployment.</description>

      <title>Understanding Intention to Adopt Smart Thermostats: The Role of Individual Predictors and Social Beliefs Across Five EU Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heating of buildings represents a significant share of the energy consumption in Europe. Smart thermostats that capitalize on the data-driven analysis of heating patterns in order to optimize heat supply are a very promising part of building energy management technology. However, factors driving their acceptance by building inhabitants are poorly understood although being a prerequisite for fully tapping on their potential. In order to understand the driving forces of technology adoption in this use case, a large survey (N = 2250) was conducted in five EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Greece). For the data analysis structural equation modelling based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was employed, which was extended by adding social beliefs, including descriptive social norms, collective efficacy, social identity and trust. As a result, performance expectancy, price value, and effort expectancy proved to be the most important predictors overall, with variations across countries. In sum, the adoption of smart thermostats appears more strongly associated with individual beliefs about their functioning, potentially reducing their adoption. At the end of the paper, implications for policy making and marketing of smart heating technologies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Optimizations in Dynamic Circuits through Branch Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits enable adaptive operations through intermediate measurements and classical feedback. Current transpilation toolchains, such as Qiskit and T$\ket{\text{ket}}$, however, fail to fully exploit branch-specific simplifications. In this work, we propose recursive branch expansion as a novel technique which systematically expands and refines conditional branches. Our method complements existing transpilers by creating additional opportunities for branch-specific simplifications without altering the overall circuit functionality. Using randomly generated circuits with varying patterns and scales, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the depth and gate count of execution paths of dynamic circuits. We also showcase the potential of our method to enable optimizations on error-corrected circuits.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for realizing practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) but comes with substantial resource overhead. Quantum circuits must be compiled into the Clifford+T gate set, where the non-transversal nature of the T-gates necessitates costly magic distillation. As circuit complexity grows, so does the T-depth: the sequential T-gate layers, due to the decomposition of arbitrary rotations, further increasing the QEC demands. Optimizing T-depth poses two key challenges: it is NP-hard and existing solutions like greedy or brute-force algorithms are either suboptimal or computationally expensive. We address this by framing the problem as a search task and propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to discover near-optimal T-gate merge patterns across circuit layers. To improve upon convergence and solution quality, we incorporate a mathematical expansion scheme that facilitates reordering layers to identify better merge opportunities, along with a greedy initialization strategy based on T-gate density. Our method achieves up to 79.23% T-depth reduction and 41.86% T-count reduction in large circuits (90-100 qubits). Compared to state-of-the-art methods like the lookahead-based approach, our framework yields an average improvement of 1.2x across varying circuit sizes and T-gate densities. Our approach is hardware-agnostic making it compatible with diverse QEC architectures such as surface codes and QLDPCs, resulting in a scalable and practical optimization framework for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>HalluShift: Measuring Distribution Shifts towards Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered widespread attention due to their adeptness at generating innovative responses to the given prompts across a multitude of domains. However, LLMs often suffer from the inherent limitation of hallucinations and generate incorrect information while maintaining well-structured and coherent responses. In this work, we hypothesize that hallucinations stem from the internal dynamics of LLMs. Our observations indicate that, during passage generation, LLMs tend to deviate from factual accuracy in subtle parts of responses, eventually shifting toward misinformation. This phenomenon bears a resemblance to human cognition, where individuals may hallucinate while maintaining logical coherence, embedding uncertainty within minor segments of their speech. To investigate this further, we introduce an innovative approach, HalluShift, designed to analyze the distribution shifts in the internal state space and token probabilities of the LLM-generated responses. Our method attains superior performance compared to existing baselines across various benchmark datasets. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/sharanya-dasgupta001/hallushift.</description>

      <title>Towards Intuitive Drone Operation Using a Handheld Motion Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an intuitive human-drone interaction system that utilizes a gesture-based motion controller to enhance the drone operation experience in real and simulated environments. The handheld motion controller enables natural control of the drone through the movements of the operator's hand, thumb, and index finger: the trigger press manages the throttle, the tilt of the hand adjusts pitch and roll, and the thumbstick controls yaw rotation. Communication with drones is facilitated via the ExpressLRS radio protocol, ensuring robust connectivity across various frequencies. The user evaluation of the flight experience with the designed drone controller using the UEQ-S survey showed high scores for both Pragmatic (mean=2.2, SD = 0.8) and Hedonic (mean=2.3, SD = 0.9) Qualities. This versatile control interface supports applications such as research, drone racing, and training programs in real and simulated environments, thereby contributing to advances in the field of human-drone interaction.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore how the combination of synthetic biology, neuroscience modeling, and neuromorphic electronic systems offers a new approach to creating an artificial system that mimics the natural sense of smell. We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in replicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We investigate a hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features: a) receptor-gated ion channels, b) interface between synthetic biology and semiconductors and c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking networks. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive, specific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are set to transform how machines process and generate human-like responses by integrating diverse modalities such as text, images, and code. Yet, effectively harnessing their capabilities hinges on optimal prompt engineering. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of seven prompt engineering methods applied to 13 open-source MLLMs over 24 tasks spanning Reasoning and Compositionality, Multimodal Understanding and Alignment, Complex Code Generation and Execution, and Knowledge Retrieval and Integration. Our approach stratifies models by parameter count into Small (&lt;4B), Medium (4B-10B), and Large (&gt;10B) categories and compares prompting techniques including Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Analogical, Generated Knowledge, and Tree-of-Thought. While Large MLLMs excel in structured tasks such as code generation, achieving accuracies up to 96.88% under Few-Shot prompting, all models struggle with complex reasoning and abstract understanding, often yielding accuracies below 60% and high hallucination rates. Structured reasoning prompts frequently increased hallucination up to 75% in small models and led to longer response times (over 20 seconds in Large MLLMs), while simpler prompting methods provided more concise and efficient outputs. No single prompting method uniformly optimises all task types. Instead, adaptive strategies combining example-based guidance with selective structured reasoning are essential to enhance robustness, efficiency, and factual accuracy. Our findings offer practical recommendations for prompt engineering and support more reliable deployment of MLLMs across applications including AI-assisted coding, knowledge retrieval, and multimodal content understanding.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare holds significant potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support medical treatment planning. These AI-driven systems can analyze vast datasets, assisting clinicians in identifying diseases, recommending treatments, and predicting patient outcomes. This study evaluates the performance of a range of contemporary LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, on the 2024 Portuguese National Exam for medical specialty access (PNA), a standardized medical knowledge assessment. Our results highlight considerable variation in accuracy and cost-effectiveness, with several models demonstrating performance exceeding human benchmarks for medical students on this specific task. We identify leading models based on a combined score of accuracy and cost, discuss the implications of reasoning methodologies like Chain-of-Thought, and underscore the potential for LLMs to function as valuable complementary tools aiding medical professionals in complex clinical decision-making.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained significant attention as a promising approach for developing energy-efficient, massively parallel computing systems inspired by the spiking behavior of the human brain and natively mapping Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Effective training algorithms for SNNs are imperative for increased adoption of neuromorphic platforms; however, SNN training continues to lag behind advances in other classes of ANN. In this paper, we reduce this gap by proposing an innovative encoder-decoder technique that leverages sparse coding and the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to provide an algorithm specifically designed for neuromorphic platforms. Using our proposed Dataset-Scalable Exemplar LCA-Decoder we reduce the computational demands and memory requirements associated with training SNNs using error backpropagation methods on increasingly larger training sets. We offer a solution that can be scalably applied to datasets of any size. Our results show the highest reported top-1 test accuracy using SNNs on the ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks. Specifically, we achieved a record top-1 accuracy of 80.75% on ImageNet (ILSVRC2012 validation set) and 79.32% on CIFAR100 using SNNs.</description>

      <title>To Spike or Not to Spike, that is the Question</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained momentum with the emergence of various neuromorphic processors. As the field advances, there is an increasing focus on developing training methods that can effectively leverage the unique properties of spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs emulate the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, making them particularly well-suited for real-time, event-driven processing. To fully harness the potential of SNNs across different neuromorphic platforms, effective training methodologies are essential. In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. This work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead neurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm, resulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial reduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy on spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on these datasets.</description>

      <title>An RRAM compute-in-memory architecture for energy-efffcient binary matrix-vector multiplication processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary matrix-vector multiplication (BMVM) is a key operation in post-quantum cryptography schemes like the Classic McEliece cryptosystem. Conventional computing architectures incur signiffcant energy efffciency loss due to data movement of large matrices when handling such tasks. Non-volatile compute-in-memory (nvCIM) is an idealtechnology for energy-efffcient BMVM processing but faces challenges,including signal margin degradation in high input-parallelism arrays due to device non-idealities and high hardware overhead from current readout and XOR operations. This work presents a resistive memory (RRAM) nvCIM architecture featuring: 1) 1T1R cells with high-resistive-state compensation modules; and 2) pulsed current-sensing parity checkers. Based on the 180nm process and test results from RRAM devices, the computing accuracy and efffciency of the architecture are veriffed by simulation. The proposed architecture performs high-precision current accumulation with a maximum MAC value of 10 and achieves an energy efffciency of 1.51TOPS/W, offering approximately 1.62 times improvement compared to an advanced 28nm FPGA platform.</description>

Abstract: The recent success of Vision Transformers has generated significant interest in attention mechanisms and transformer architectures. Although existing methods have proposed spiking self-attention mechanisms compatible with spiking neural networks, they often face challenges in effective deployment on current neuromorphic platforms. This paper introduces a novel model that combines vision transformers with the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to facilitate efficient neuromorphic deployment. Our experiments show that ViT-LCA achieves higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset while consuming significantly less energy than other spiking vision transformer counterparts. Furthermore, ViT-LCA's neuromorphic-friendly design allows for more direct mapping onto current neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: In-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with resistive random-access memory (RRAM) represents a highly promising solution that solves matrix problems in one step. However, the existing AMC circuits each have a specific connection topology to implement a single computing function, lack of the universality as a matrix processor. In this work, we design a reconfigurable AMC macro for general-purpose matrix computations, which is achieved by configuring proper connections between memory array and amplifier circuits. Based on this macro, we develop a hybrid system that incorporates an on-chip write-verify scheme and digital functional modules, to deliver a general-purpose AMC solver for various applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating large-scale linear algebra using variational quantum imaginary time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solution of large sparse linear systems via factorization methods such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, can be computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' Graph partitioning can be used to reduce the ``fill-in,'' thereby speeding up the solution of the linear system. We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE). We develop a hybrid quantum/classical method to accelerate Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by using VarQITE in Ansys's LS-DYNA multiphysics simulation software. This allows us to study different types of FEA problems, from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics in simulations and on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte).
  We demonstrate that VarQITE has the potential to impact LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum/classical workflow on selected FEA problem instances, including simulation of blood pumps, automotive roof crush, and vibration analysis of car bodies on meshes of up to six million elements. We find that the LS-DYNA wall clock time can be improved by up to 12\% for some problems. Finally, we introduce a classical heuristic inspired by Fiduccia-Mattheyses to improve the quality of VarQITE solutions obtained from hardware runs. Our results highlight the potential impact of quantum computing on large-scale FEA problems in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>GIScience in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Research Agenda Towards Autonomous GIS</title>

Abstract: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. Meanwhile, as we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</description>

      <title>Context Switching for Secure Multi-programming of Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-programming quantum computers improve device utilization and throughput. However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems.
  We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</description>
