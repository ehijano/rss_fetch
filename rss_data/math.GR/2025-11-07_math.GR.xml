      <title>On a lemma of Milnor and Schwarz, apr\`es Rosendal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perhaps the fundamental theorem of geometric group theory, the Milnor--Schwarz lemma gives conditions under which the orbit map relating the geometry of a geodesic metric space and the word metric on a group acting isometrically on the space is a quasi-isometry.
  Pioneering work of Rosendal makes these and other techniques of geometric group theory applicable to an arbitrary (topological) group. We give a succinct treatment of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, setting it within this context. We derive some applications of this theory to non-Archimedean groups, which have plentiful continuous actions on graphs. In particular, we sharpen results of BarNatan and Verberne on actions of "big" mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs and clarify a project begun by Mann and Rafi to classify these mapping class groups up to quasi-isometry, noting some extensions to the theory of mapping class groups of locally finite infinite graphs and homeomorphism groups of Stone spaces.</description>

      <title>The Difference Subgroup Graph of a Finite Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{difference subgroup graph} $D(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as the graph whose vertices are the non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$, with two distinct vertices $H$ and $K$ adjacent if and only if $\langle H, K \rangle = G$ but $HK \ne G$. This graph arises naturally as the difference between the join graph $\Delta(G)$ and the comaximal subgroup graph $\Gamma(G)$. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of $D(G)$ and its reduced version $D^*(G)$, obtained by removing isolated vertices.
  We establish several fundamental structural properties of these graphs, including conditions for connectivity, forbidden subgraph characterizations, and the relationship between graph parameters - such as independence number, clique number, and girth - and the solvability or nilpotency of the underlying group.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of a torus and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$, we study the dynamics of actions of automorphisms of $G$ on certain compact invariant subspaces of closed subgroups of $G$ in terms of distality and expansivity. We show that only the finite order automorphisms of $G$ act distally on Sub$^p_G$, the smallest compact space containing all closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$, when $G$ is any $n$-torus, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This enables us to relate distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of closed subgroups generate by $T$ in the group Aut$(G)$, in case $G$ is not a vector group. We also extend these results to the action of subgroups of automorphisms. We show that any $n$-torus $G$, $n\geq 2$, more generally, any connected Lie group $G$ whose central torus has dimension at least 2, does not admit any automorphism which acts expansively on Sub$^p_G$. Our results generalise some results on distal actions by Shah and Yadav, and by Chatterjee and Shah, and some results on expansive actions by Prajapati and Shah.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups and Structure of 4-Valent Cayley Graphs on Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group and S be an inverse-closed subset of G not containing the identity. The Cayley graph Cay(G, S) has vertex set G, where two vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if the group element obtained by applying the group operation to x and the inverse of y belongs to S. Kaseasbeh and Erfanian (2021) determined the structure of all Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of order 2n for subsets S of size at most three. We extend their work by analyzing the structure of all such Cayley graphs for subsets S of size four. Among other results, our main results are as follows for subsets S of size at least four: (1) using a classical result of Burnside and Schur (1911), we determine the automorphism groups of a family of Cayley graphs where S contains only rotations; (2) if S consists only of rotations, then the Cayley graph is the disjoint union of two isomorphic circulant graphs on n vertices; and (3) if S is a set of k reflections generating the dihedral group, then the Cayley graph is bipartite, forming the disjoint union of k perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>The CLT for lamplighter groups with an acylindrically hyperbolic base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Central Limit Theorem for the drift of a non-elementary random walk with a finite exponential moment on a wreath product $A\wr H=\bigoplus_{H} A\rtimes H$ with $A$ a non-trivial finite group and $H$ a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group. We also provide the upper bounds on the central moments of the drift. Furthermore, our results extend to the case where $A$ is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) finitely generated group.</description>

      <title>Character Theory for Semilinear Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic one-variable polynomials. In both cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair $(p,\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Uniform first order interpretation of the second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the first order theory of the homeomorphism group of a compact manifold interprets the full second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms of the manifold. The interpretation is uniform across manifolds of bounded dimension. As a consequence, many classical problems in group theory and geometry (e.g.~the linearity of mapping classes of compact $2$--manifolds) are encoded as elementary properties of homeomorphism groups of manifolds. Furthermore, the homeomorphism group uniformly interprets the Borel and projective hierarchies of the homeomorphism group, which gives a characterization of definable subsets of the homeomorphism group. Finally, we prove analogues of Rice's Theorem from computability theory for homeomorphism groups of manifolds. As a consequence, it follows that the collection of sentences that isolate the homeomorphism group of a particular manifold, or that isolate the homeomorphism groups of manifolds in general, is not definable in second order arithmetic, and that membership of particular sentences in these collections cannot be proved in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Super commuting graphs of finite groups and their Zagreb indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B$ be an equivalence relation defined on a finite group $G$. The $B$ super commuting graph on $G$ is a graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $g$ and $h$ are adjacent if either $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $g' \in [g]$ and $h' \in [h]$ such that $g'$ commutes with $h'$, where $[g]$ is the $B$-equivalence class of $g \in G$. Considering $B$ as the equality, conjugacy and same order relations on $G$, in this article, we discuss the graph structures of equality/conjugacy/order super commuting graphs of certain well-known families of non-abelian groups viz. dihedral groups, dicyclic groups, semidihedral groups, quasidihedral groups, the groups $U_{6n}, V_{8n}, M_{2mn}$ etc. Further, we compute the Zagreb indices of these graphs and show that they satisfy Hansen-Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture.</description>

      <title>Products of Infinite Countable Groups Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak limit of a sequence of factors of i.i.d. An essential tool for avoiding any growth conditions is the convergence in the sense of point processes of closed pointed subsets, which is a notion from stochastic geometry. Then, a graphing of the horoball process is constructed with arbitrarily small expected degree, by connecting the points of each horoball first, and then adding a percolation with small intensity. The connectedness of this graphing is ensured by proving that the resulting horoballs have the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully. Direct simple proofs are given that do not rely on sophisticated results like amenability and double-recurrence, which are used in related works. Also, to manage the overlapping of the horoballs, a generalization of the induction lemma is presented for random multisets of a group.</description>

      <title>On the entropies of subshifts of finite type on countable amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.10015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G,H$ be two countable amenable groups. We introduce the notion of group charts, which gives us a tool to embed an arbitrary $H$-subshift into a $G$-subshift. Using an entropy addition formula derived from this formalism we prove that whenever $H$ is finitely presented and admits a subshift of finite type (SFT) on which $H$ acts freely, then the set of real numbers attained as topological entropies of $H$-SFTs is contained in the set of topological entropies of $G$-SFTs modulo an arbitrarily small additive constant for any finitely generated group $G$ which admits a translation-like action of $H$. In particular, we show that the set of topological entropies of $G$-SFTs on any such group which has decidable word problem and admits a translation-like action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ coincides with the set of non-negative upper semi-computable real numbers. We use this result to give a complete characterization of the entropies of SFTs in several classes of groups.
  Corrigendum: An error has been found in the proof of Theorem 4.7. We have added a corrigendum appendix which explains the error, discusses possible solutions and details which results from Section 5 still hold (the only result that is no longer proven is Corollary 5.12). We also provide an update on the state of the art concerning the questions asked in Section 6.</description>
