      <title>Shift associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of algebras satisfying the identity $(xy)z=y(zx),$ named as shift associative algebras. Our research shows that these algebras are related to many interesting identities. In particular, they are related to anti-Poisson-Jordan algebras and algebras of associative type $\sigma$. We study algebras of associative type $\sigma$ to be Koszul and self-dual. A basis of the free shift associative algebra generated by a countable set $X$ was constructed. An analog of Wedderburn-Artin's theorem was established. The algebraic and geometric classifications of complex $4$-dimensional shift associative algebras are given. In particular, we proved that the first non-associative shift associative algebra appears only in dimension $5$.</description>

      <title>Relative PGF modules and dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired in part by recent work of \v{S}aroch and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek in the setting of Gorenstein homological algebra, we extend the notion of Foxby-Golod ${\rm G_C}$-dimension of finitely generated modules with respect to a semidualizing module $C$ to arbitrary modules over arbitrary rings, with respect to a module $C$ that is not necessarily semidualizing. We call this dimension ${\rm PG_CF}$ dimension and show that it can serve as an alternative definition of the ${\rm G_C}$-projective dimension introduced by Holm and J\o rgensen. Modules with ${\rm PG_CF}$ dimension zero are called ${\rm PG_CF}$ modules. When the module $C$ is nice enough, we show that the class ${\rm PG_CF}(R)$ of these modules is projectively resolving. This enables us to obtain good homological properties of this new dimension. We also show that ${\rm PG_CF}(R)$ is the left-hand side of a complete hereditary cotorsion pair. This yields, from a homotopical perspective, a hereditary Hovey triple where the cofibrant objects coincide with the ${\rm PG_CF}$ modules and the fibrant objects coincide with the modules in the well-known Bass class $\mathcal{B}_C(R)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are the notes for an undergraduate course at the University of Edinburgh, 2021-2023. Assuming basic knowledge of ring theory, group theory and linear algebra, the notes lay out the theory of field extensions and their Galois groups, up to and including the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. Also included are a section on ruler and compass constructions, a proof that solvable polynomials have solvable Galois groups, and the classification of finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the quandle polynomial. We prove that our polynomial is an invariant of stuquandles. Furthermore, we use the invariant of stuquandles to define a polynomial invariant of stuck links. As a byproduct, we obtain a polynomial invariant of RNA foldings. Lastly, we provide explicit computations of our polynomial invariant for both stuck links and RNA foldings.</description>

      <title>Soluble skew left braces and soluble solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation calls for a deep understanding of the algebraic structure of a skew left brace. In this paper, the skew brace theoretical property of solubility is introduced and studied. It leads naturally to the notion of solubility of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. It turns out that soluble non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions are characterised by soluble skew left braces. The rich ideal structure of soluble skew left braces is also shown. A worked example showing the relevance of the brace theoretical property of solubility is also presented.</description>

      <title>Compatible structures of operads by polarization, their Koszul duality and Manin products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic structures with multiple copies of a given type of operations interrelated by various compatibility conditions have long being studied in mathematics and mathematical physics. They are broadly referred as linearly compatible, matching, and totally compatible structures. This paper gives a unified approach to these structures in the context of operads. We first generalize the process of polarization for polynomials in invariant theory to the one for operads, leading to the general notion of linearly compatible operads. Refining the polarization by partitioning it into foliations, we obtain a notion of matching operads consolidating those appeared recently from applications of regularity structures, and Volterra integral equations. Distinguished among them is the leveled matching compatibility, which is unique with respect to a fix ordering of the vertices in tree monomials. Equating all matching compatibilities of a given operad leads to the totally compatible operad of this operad.
  For unary/binary quadratic operads, the linear compatibility and the total compatibility are in Koszul dual to each other, and there is a Koszul self-duality among the matching compatibilities. In particular, the leveled matching compatibility is Koszul self-dual. For binary quadratic operads, these three compatible operads can also be obtained by taking Manin black and white products. For some finitely generated binary quadratic operad, Koszulity is preserved under taking the compatibilities.</description>

      <title>An algebraic proof of the dichotomy for graph orientation problems with forbidden tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a set F of finite tournaments, the F-free orientation problem is the problem of orienting a given finite undirected graph in such a way that the resulting oriented graph does not contain any member of F. Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new shorter proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems obtained recently by Bodirsky and Guzm\'{a}n-Pro. In fact, our approach yields a complexity dichotomy for a considerably larger class of computational problems where one is given an undirected graph along with additional local constraints on the allowed orientations. Moreover, the border between tractable and hard problems is described by a decidable algebraic condition.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>
