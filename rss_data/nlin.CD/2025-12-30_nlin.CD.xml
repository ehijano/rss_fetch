      <title>Universality classes of chaos in non Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical chaos theory rests on the notion of universality, whereby disparate dynamical systems share identical scaling laws. Existing universality classes, however, implicitly assume Markovian dynamics. Here, a logistic map endowed with power law memory is used to show that Feigenbaum universality breaks down when temporal correlations decay sufficiently slowly. A critical memory exponent is identified that separates perturbative and memory dominated regimes, demonstrating that long range memory acts as a relevant renormalisation operator and generates a new universality class of chaotic dynamics. The onset of chaos is accompanied by fractional scaling of Lyapunov exponents, in quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. These results establish temporal correlations as a previously unexplored axis of universality in chaotic systems, with implications for physical, biological and geophysical settings where memory effects are intrinsic.</description>

      <title>On the efficient numerical computation of covariant Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) are useful in multiple applications, but the optimal time windows needed to accurately compute these vectors are yet unclear. To remedy this, we investigate two methods for determining when to safely terminate the forward and backward transient phases of the CLV computation algorithm by Ginelli et al.~\cite{GinelliEtAl2007} when applied to chaotic orbits of conservative Hamiltonian systems. We perform this investigation for two prototypical Hamiltonian systems, namely the well-known H\'enon-Heiles system of two degrees of freedom and a system of three nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators having three degrees of freedom, finding very similar results for the two methods and thus recommending the more efficient one. We find that the accuracy of two-dimesnional center subspace computations is significantly reduced when the backward evolution stages of the algorithm are performed over long time intervals. We explain this observation by examining the tangent dynamics of the center subspace wherein CLVs tend to align/anti-align, and we propose an adaptation of the algorithm that improves the accuracy of such computations over long times by preventing this alignment/anti-alignment of CLVs in the center subspace.</description>

      <title>Analytical prediction of delayed Hopf bifurcations in a simplified stochastic model of reed musical instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a simplified single reed instrument model subject to a stochastic forcing of white noise type when one of its bifurcation parameters (the dimensionless blowing pressure) increases linearly over time and crosses the Hopf bifurcation point of its trivial equilibrium position. The stochastic slow dynamics of the model is first obtained by means of the stochastic averaging method. The resulting averaged system reduces to a non-autonomous one-dimensional It{\^o} stochastic differential equation governing the time evolution of the mouthpiece pressure amplitude. Under relevant approximations the latter is solved analytically treating separately cases where noise can be ignored and cases where it cannot. From that, two analytical expressions of the bifurcation parameter value for which the mouthpiece pressure amplitude gets its initial value back are deduced. These special values of the bifurcation parameter characterize the effective appearance of sound in the instrument and are called deterministic dynamic bifurcation point if the noise can be neglected and stochastic dynamic bifurcation point otherwise. Finally, for illustration and validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with direct numerical integration of the model in both deterministic and stochastic situations. In each considered case, a good agreement is observed between theoretical results and numerical simulations, which validates the proposed analysis.</description>

      <title>Contrasting different noise models for representing westerly wind bursts in a recharge oscillator model of ENSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been known to have a major impact on the development of El Ni\~no events. In particular, they amplify these events, with stronger events associated with a higher number of WWBs. We further find indications that WWBs lead to a more monotonically increasing evolution of warming events. We consider here a noise-driven recharge oscillator model of ENSO. Commonly, WWBs are represented by a state-dependent Gaussian noise which naturally reproduces the amplification of warm events. However, we show that many properties of WWBs and their effects on sea surface temperature (SST) are not well captured by such Gaussian noise. Instead, we show that conditional additive and multiplicative (CAM) noise presents a promising alternative. In addition to recovering the sporadic nature of WWBs, CAM noise leads to an asymmetry between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events without the need for deterministic nonlinearities. Furthermore, CAM noise generates a more monotonic increase of extreme warming events with a higher frequency of WWBs accompanying the largest events. This suggests that extreme warm events are better modelled by CAM noise. To cover the full spectrum of warm events we propose a conditional noise model in which the wind stress is modelled by additive Gaussian noise for sufficiently small SSTs and by additive CAM noise once the SST exceeds a certain threshold. We show that this conditional noise model captures the observed properties of WWBs reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Linearly-scalable and entropy-optimal learning of nonstationary and nonlinear manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Entropy-Optimal Manifold Clustering (EOMC) - and show that it mitigates the cost scaling and robustness issues of the existing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning tools in nonstationary and nonlinear situations, while pertaining the favourable O(T) iteration complexity scaling in the statistics size T, and allowing explicit computation of input data reliability. Application to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system in chaotic regime, as well as to a modified Hasegawa-Wakatani (mHW) model of drift-wave turbulence in the edge of a tokamak plasma reveals that for both of the models their essential dynamics is best described as a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent low-dimensional manifolds. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 and mHW output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others). These findings open new exciting opportunities for EOMC and transfer operator theory, by offering new possibilities to significantly improve predictive skills and performance of data-driven tools in fluid mechanics and geosciences applications.</description>
