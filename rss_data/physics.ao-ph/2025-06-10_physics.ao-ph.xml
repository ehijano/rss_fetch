      <title>Imposing the Fundamental Dynamical Constraint of Hydrostatic Balance to Improve Global ML Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting weather accurately and efficiently is a critical capability in our ability to adapt to climate change. Data driven approaches to this problem have enjoyed much success recently providing forecasts with accuracy comparable to physics based numerical prediction models but at significantly reduced computational expense. However, these models typically do not incorporate any physics priors. In this work, we demonstrate improved skill of data driven weather prediction approaches by incorporating physical constraints, specifically in the context of the DLWP model (Karlbauer et. al. 2024). Near hydrostatic balance, between the vertical pressure gradient and gravity, is one of the most fundamental and well satisfied constraints on atmospheric motions. We impose this balance through both hard and soft constraints, and demonstrate that the soft constraint improves the RMSE of many forecast fields, particularly at lead times beyond 7-10 days. The positive influence of hydrostatic balance is also clearly evident in improving the physicality and strength of a 10-day forecast for hurricane Irma. These results show that adding appropriate physical constraints can improve the skill and fidelity of data driven weather models in a way that does not impose any significant additional memory capacity or scalability challenges.</description>

      <title>Unbiased calculation, evaluation, and calibration of ensemble forecast anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range ensemble forecasts are typically verified as anomalies with respect to a lead-time dependent climatological mean to remove the influence of systematic biases. However, common methods for calculating anomalies result in statistical inconsistencies between forecast and verification anomalies, even for a perfectly reliable ensemble. It is important to account for these systematic effects when evaluating ensemble forecast systems, particularly when tuning a model to improve the reliability of forecast anomalies or when comparing spread-error diagnostics between systems with different reforecast periods. Here, we show that unbiased variances and spread-error ratios can be recovered by deriving estimators that are consistent with the values that would be achieved when calculating anomalies relative to the true, but unknown, climatological mean. An elegant alternative is to construct forecast climatologies separately for each member, which ensures that forecast and verification anomalies are defined relative to reference climatological means with the same sampling uncertainty. This alternative approach has no impact on forecast ensemble means but systematically modifies the total variance and ensemble spread of forecast anomalies in such a way that anomaly-based spread-error ratios are unbiased without any explicit correction for climatology sample size. Furthermore, the improved statistical consistency of forecast and verification anomalies means that probabilistic forecast skill is optimised when the underlying forecast is also perfectly reliable. Alternative methods for anomaly calculation can thus impact probabilistic forecast skill, especially when anomalies are defined relative to climatologies with a small sample size. Finally, we demonstrate the equivalence of anomalies calculated using different methods after applying an unbiased statistical calibration.</description>

      <title>Ensemble reliability and the signal-to-noise paradox in large-ensemble subseasonal forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have illustrated the existence of a `signal-to-noise paradox' (SNP) in some ensemble forecasting systems that manifests as situations where the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and the observed truth is larger than the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and individual forecast members. A well-calibrated forecast system that simultaneously satisfies climatological and ensemble variance reliability criteria will not exhibit an SNP if sample statistics can be evaluated using a sufficiently large ensemble size ($N$) over a sufficiently large number of independent cases ($M$). However, when $M$ is finite, an apparent SNP will sometimes occur as a natural consequence of sampling uncertainty, even in a perfectly reliable ensemble with many members. In this study, we evaluate the forecast skill, reliability characteristics, and signal-to-noise properties of three large-scale atmospheric circulation indices in 100-member subseasonal reforecasts with the ECMWF IFS. Daily mean NAO forecasts generally satisfy unbiased reliability criteria within the tolerance of our estimated sampling uncertainties. Nevertheless, NAO forecasts in this dataset exhibit symptoms of the SNP at subseasonal lead times. However, we do not find robust evidence for an underestimation of the magnitude of predictable signals and do not exclude the possibility that the apparent paradox in this dataset is a consequence of observational sampling uncertainties that are insensitive to ensemble size and common to all comparisons for this set of forecast start dates and lead times. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this apparent SNP can be eliminated with an unbiased reliability calibration. However, this is achieved through overfitting such that calibrated forecasts inherit the large sampling uncertainties present in the observations and thus exhibit unphysical variations with lead time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves significantly influences remote sensing, interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. This paper revisits the wave crest and action conservation laws and derives steady, nonlinear, analytical solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full crest and action conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed 5/8 to wavenumber, 1/4 due to wave action, and 1/8 due to effective gravity. Examining the homogeneity and stationarity requirements for the conservation of wave action reveals that stationarity is a stronger requirement and is generally not satisfied for very steep long waves. We examine the results of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and not generally. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the nonlinear crest-action conservation solutions in long-wave steepness $\lesssim$ 0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the non-linearised crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>
