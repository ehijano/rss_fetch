      <title>Undergraduate setup for measuring the Bell inequalities and performing Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of quantum technologies is attracting the interest of many students eager to learn concepts such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition. However, the non-intuitive nature of these concepts poses a challenge to understanding them. Here, we present an entangled photon system which can perform a Bell test, i.e. the CHSH inequality, and can obtain the complete tomography of the two-photon state. The proposed setup is versatile, cost-effective and allows for multiple classroom operating modes. We present two variants, both facilitating the measurement of Bell inequalities and quantum state tomography. Experimental results showcase successful manipulation of the quantum state of the photons, achieving high-fidelity entangled states and significant violations of Bell's inequalities. Our setup's simplicity and affordability enhances accessibility for less specialized laboratories, allowing students to familiarize themselves with quantum physics concepts.</description>

      <title>Importance of accounting for student identities and intersectionality for creating equitable and inclusive physics learning environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research focuses on the experiences of seven undergraduate women who were majoring in physics in a medium-size physics department at a small liberal arts college. In the semi-structured, empathetic interviews we conducted, the women discussed how they decided to major in physics, their interactions with their peers and instructors, who supported them during their physics trajectory, and suggestions that would improve their experiences in physics. We used Standpoint theory and focused on the experiences of undergraduate women to get a holistic perspective of how they became interested in physics, how they have been supported in their physics journey as well as identify any challenges that they faced in their undergraduate physics program due to their identity. Using synergistic frameworks such as the Domains of Power and the Holistic Ecosystem for Learning Physics in an Inclusive and Equitable Environment (HELPIEE), we analyzed how those in the position of power, e.g., instructors, can play important roles in establishing and maintaining safe, equitable, and inclusive environments for students, which is especially important for historically marginalized students such as women and ethnic and racial minority students in physics. We also discuss the suggestions provided by the undergraduate women to implement in the future to support current and future undergraduate women in physics and astronomy. Their suggestions are separated as personal advice for peers and suggestions for physics instructors.</description>
