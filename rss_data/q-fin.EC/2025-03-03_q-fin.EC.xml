      <title>Excertos da Historia Keynesiana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analytically describes the contributions of Keynesian theory in the post-World War I context, by means of a synoptic reading of the bibliographical sources indicated, the Keynesian theory within its own historical and philosophical context. The discussion covers the main concepts of his theory. The aim is, through the excerpts highlighted in the article, to briefly contextualize the origins of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes' economic thought.</description>

      <title>Network effects and incumbent response to entry threats: empirical evidence from the airline industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate how incumbents in the U.S. airline industry respond to threatened and actual route entry by Southwest Airlines. I use a two-way fixed effects and event study approach, and the latest available data from 1999-2022, to identify a firm's price and quantity response. I find evidence that incumbents cut fares preemptively (post-entry) by 6-8% (16-18%) although the significance, pattern, and timing of the preemptive cuts are quite different to Goolsbee and Syverson's (2008) earlier results. Incumbents increase capacity preemptively by 10-40%, up to six quarters before the entry threat is established, and by 27-46% post-entry. My results suggest a clear shift in firms' strategic response from price to quantity. I also investigate the impact of an incumbent's network structure on its preemptive and post-entry behaviour. While the results on price are unclear, a firm's post-entry capacity reaction depends strongly on its global network structure as well as the local importance (centrality) of the route.</description>

      <title>Natural Asset Beta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural capital accounting is important to efforts that attempt to measure the value of nature to decide on how best to trade-off natural resource productive use and conservation. Much work on measuring reciprocal physical stocks and flows of natural resources between nature and the economy has occurred. However, the current open problem of translating natural resource physical stocks and flows into monetary ones presents a barrier to estimating opportunity costs to inform resource allocation decisions. The research reported here extends a theoretical model on economic sustainability and derives a novel asset beta notion for nature. Like traditional firm asset beta notions, this underpins corporate finance notions for nature. Supply and demand curves estimating the exchange value of the natural resource are possible. A real-world data set is utilised for a preliminary proof of concept test. The results show promise, but future research is suggested investigating the sensitivity of the estimates.</description>

      <title>Tracks to Modernity: Railroads, Growth, and Social Movements in Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do transport infrastructures shape economic transformation and social change? We examine the impact of railway expansion in nineteenth-century Denmark on local population growth, occupational shifts, and the diffusion of ideas. Using a historical panel dataset and a difference-in-differences approach, we document that railway access significantly increased population growth and accelerated structural change. Moreover, railway-connected areas were more likely to establish key institutions linked to civic engagement and the cooperative movement. These findings suggest that improved market access was not only a driver of economic modernization but also a catalyst for institutional and cultural transformation.</description>

      <title>Solar prosumage under different pricing regimes: Interactions with the transmission grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prosumers, residential electricity consumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage, are transforming electricity markets. Their interactions with the transmission grid under varying tariff designs are not yet fully understood. We explore the influence of different pricing regimes on prosumer investment and dispatch decisions and their subsequent impact on the transmission grid. Using an integrated modeling approach that combines two open-source dispatch, investment and grid models, we simulate prosumage behavior in Germany's electricity market under real-time pricing or time-invariant pricing, as well as under zonal or nodal pricing. Our findings show that zonal pricing favors prosumer investments, while time-invariant pricing rather hinders it. In comparison, regional solar availability emerges as a larger driver for rooftop PV investments. The impact of prosumer strategies on grid congestion remains limited within the scope of our model-setup, in which home batteries cannot be used for energy arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation for Topic Modeling in Organizational Research: An Introduction with Empirical Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>

      <title>Retractions: Updating from Complex Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify a canonical experimental design to identify the effectiveness of retractions. Comparing beliefs after retractions to beliefs (a) without the retracted information and (b) after equivalent new information, we find that retractions result in diminished belief updating in both cases. We propose this reflects updating from retractions being more complex, and our analysis supports this: we find longer response times, lower accuracy, and higher variability. The results -- robust across diverse subject groups and design variations -- enhance our understanding of belief updating and offer insights into addressing misinformation.</description>

      <title>Startup Acquisitions: Acquihires and Talent Hoarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how competitive forces may drive firms to inefficiently acquire startup talent. In our model, two rival firms have the capacity to acquire and integrate a startup operating in an orthogonal market. We show that firms may pursue such acquihires primarily as a preemptive strategy, even when they appear unprofitable in isolation. Thus, acquihires, even absent traditional competition-reducing effects, need not be benign, as they can lead to inefficient talent allocation. Additionally, our analysis underscores that such talent hoarding can diminish consumer surplus and exacerbate job volatility for acquihired employees.</description>

      <title>Time is Knowledge: What Response Times Reveal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response times contain information about economically relevant but unobserved variables like willingness to pay, preference intensity, quality, or happiness. Here, we provide a general characterization of the properties of latent variables that can be detected using response time data. Our characterization generalizes various results in the literature, helps to solve identification problems of binary response models, and paves the way for many new applications. We apply the result to test the hypothesis that marginal happiness is decreasing in income, a principle that is commonly accepted but so far not established empirically.</description>

      <title>Never-ending Search for Innovation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a model of investment in innovation that is dynamic, features multiple heterogeneous research projects of which only one potentially leads to success, and in each period, the researcher chooses the set of projects to invest in. We show that if a search for innovation starts, it optimally does not end until the innovation is found -- which will be never with a strictly positive probability.</description>
