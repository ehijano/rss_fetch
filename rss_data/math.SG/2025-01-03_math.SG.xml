      <title>Real Forms of Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.10417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By complexifying a Hamiltonian system one obtains dynamics on a holomorphic symplectic manifold. To invert this construction we present a theory of real forms which not only recovers the original system but also yields different real Hamiltonian systems which share the same complexification. This provides a notion of real forms for holomorphic Hamiltonian systems analogous to that of real forms for complex Lie algebras. Our main result is that the complexification of any analytic mechanical system on a Grassmannian admits a real form on a compact symplectic manifold. This produces a `unitary trick' for Hamiltonian systems which curiously requires an essential use of hyperk\"ahler geometry. We demonstrate this result by finding compact real forms for the simple pendulum, the spherical pendulum, and the rigid body.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry and Fukaya categories of singular hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.09764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a definition of the Fukaya category of a singular hypersurface proposed by Auroux, given by localizing the Fukaya category of a nearby fiber at Seidel's natural transformation, and show that this possesses several desirable properties. Firstly, we prove an A-side analog of Orlov's derived Kn\"orrer periodicity theorem by showing that Auroux's category is derived equivalent to the Fukaya-Seidel category of a higher-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg model. Secondly, we describe how this definition implies homological mirror symmetry for some large complex structure limit degenerations of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for functors between Fukaya categories of very affine hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that homological mirror symmetry for very affine hypersurfaces respects certain natural symplectic operations (as functors between partially wrapped Fukaya categories), verifying conjectures of Auroux. These conjectures concern compatibility between mirror symmetry for a very affine hypersurface and its complement, itself also a very affine hypersurface. We find that the complement of a very affine hypersurface has in fact two natural mirrors, one of which is a derived scheme. These two mirrors are related via a non-geometric equivalence mediated by Kn\"orrer periodicity; Auroux's conjectures require some modification to take this into account. Our proof also introduces new techniques for presenting Liouville manifolds as gluings of Liouville sectors.</description>

      <title>Strongly adapted contact geometry of Anosov 3-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a 3 dimensional contact geometric characterization of Anosov 3-flows based on interactions with Reeb dynamics. We investigate basic properties of the space of the resulting geometries. A technical theorem on asymptotic synchronization of adapted norms is proved, which can be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>On The Cost Function Associated With Legendrian Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a non-negative integer-valued function that measures the obstruction for converting topological isotopy between two Legendrian knots into a Legendrian isotopy. We refer to this function as the Cost function. We show that the Cost function induces a metric on the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots. Hence, the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots can be seen as a graph with path-metric given by the Cost function. Legendrian simple knot types are shown to be characterized using the Cost function. We also get a quantitative version of Fuchs-Tabachnikov's Theorem that says any two Legendrian knots in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{std})$ in the same topological knot type become Legendrian isotopic after sufficiently many stabilizations. We compute the Cost function for Legendrian simple knots (for example torus knots) and we note the behavior of Cost function for twist knots and cables of torus knots (some of which are Legendrian non-simple). We also construct examples of Legendrian representatives of 2-bridge knots and compute the Cost between them. Further, we investigate the behavior of the Cost function under the connect sum operation. We conclude with some questions about the Cost function, its relation with the standard contact structure, and the topological knot type.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <title>Circle bundles with PSC over some four manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of four manifolds with macroscopic dimension 4 equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Further, we verify that these bundles have macroscopic dimension at most 3. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>
