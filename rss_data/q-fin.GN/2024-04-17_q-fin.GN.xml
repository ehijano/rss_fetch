      <title>RD2Bench: Toward Data-Centric Automatic R&amp;D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progress of humanity is driven by those successful discoveries accompanied by countless failed experiments. Researchers often seek the potential research directions by reading and then verifying them through experiments. The process imposes a significant burden on researchers. In the past decade, the data-driven black-box deep learning method demonstrates its effectiveness in a wide range of real-world scenarios, which exacerbates the experimental burden of researchers and thus renders the potential successful discoveries veiled. Therefore, automating such a research and development (R&amp;D) process is an urgent need. In this paper, we serve as the first effort to formalize the goal by proposing a Real-world Data-centric automatic R&amp;D Benchmark, namely RD2Bench. RD2Bench benchmarks all the operations in data-centric automatic R&amp;D (D-CARD) as a whole to navigate future work toward our goal directly. We focuses on evaluating the interaction and synergistic effects of various model capabilities and aiding to select the well-performed trustworthy models. Although RD2Bench is very challenging to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language model (LLM) named GPT-4, indicating ample research opportunities and more research efforts, LLMs possess promising potential to bring more significant development to D-CARD: They are able to implement some simple methods without adopting any additional techniques. We appeal to future work to take developing techniques for tackling automatic R&amp;D into consideration, thus bringing the opportunities of the potential revolutionary upgrade to human productivity.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of diversity on corporate boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diversity in leadership positions and corporate boards is an important aspect of equality. It is important because it is the key to better decision-making and innovation, and above all, it paves the way for future generations to participate and shape our society. Many studies emphasize the importance of the visibility of role models and the effect that connectivity has on the success of minorities in leadership. However, the connectivity of firms, the dynamics of the adoption of minorities, and the long-term effects have not been well understood. Here, we present a model that shows how these effects work together in a dynamic model that is calibrated with empirical data of firm and board networks. We show that homophily -- the appointment of minorities is influenced by the presence of minorities in a board and its neighboring entities -- is an important effect shaping the trajectory towards equality. We further show how perception biases and feedback related to the centrality of minority members influence the dynamic. We find that reaching equality can be sped up or slowed down depending on the distribution of minorities in central firms. These insights bear significant implications for policy-making geared towards fostering equality and diversity within corporate boards.</description>
