      <title>BrainTAP: Brain Disorder Prediction with Adaptive Distill and Selective Prior Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from brain networks in large-scale neuroimaging cohorts such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study requires effectively integrating functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) while incorporating expert neurobiological knowledge. However, existing multimodal fusion approaches are shallow or over-homogenize the inherently heterogeneous characteristics of FC and SC, while expert-defined anatomical priors are underutilized with static integration. To address these limitations, we propose Brain Transformer with Adaptive Mutual-Distill and Selective Prior Fusion (BrainTAP). We introduce Adaptive Mutual Distill (AMD), which enables layer-wise information exchange between modalities through learnable distill-intact ratios, preserving modality-specific signals while capturing cross-modal synergies. We further develop Selective Prior Fusion (SPF), which integrates expert-defined anatomical priors in an adaptive way. Evaluated on the ABCD dataset for predicting attention-related disorders, BrainTAP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for brain disorder prediction.</description>

      <title>Designing a Token Economy: Incentives, Governance, and Tokenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, tokenomic systems, decentralized systems that use cryptographic tokens to represent value and rights, have evolved considerably. Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of acoustic Green's function in rectangular rooms with general surface impedance walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic room modes and the Green's function mode expansion are well-known for rectangular rooms with perfectly reflecting walls. First-order approximations also exist for nearly rigid boundaries; however, current analytical methods fail to accommodate more general boundary conditions, e.g., when wall absorption is significant. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis that extends previous studies by including additional first-order asymptotics that account for soft-wall boundaries. In addition, we introduce a semi-analytical, efficient, and reliable method for computing the Green's function in rectangular rooms, which is described and validated through numerical tests. With a sufficiently large truncation order, the resulting error becomes negligible, making the method suitable as a benchmark for numerical simulations. Additional aspects regarding the spectral basis orthogonality and completeness are also addressed, providing a general framework for the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.</description>
