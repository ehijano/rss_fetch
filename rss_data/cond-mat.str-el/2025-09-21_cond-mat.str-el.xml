      <title>Electronic Crystal Phases in the Presence of Non-Uniform Berry Curvature and Tunable Berry Flux: The $\lambda_N$-Jellium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer graphene systems have rekindled interest in electronic crystal phases in two dimensions -- but now for phases enriched by non-trivial quantum geometry. In this work, we introduce a simple continuum model with tunable Berry curvature distribution and total flux, enabling systematic study of crystallization in geometrically nontrivial bands. In the noninteracting limit, the addition of a C6-symmetric periodic potential yields a rich phase diagram, for which we provide several analytical insights. Notably, we derive a general formula for the Chern number in the weak-potential regime that is broadly applicable to single-band projected models. Removing the periodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline states, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which localized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to depleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous Hall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We identify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and energetic considerations. Our results provide insight into the interplay between crystallization and band geometry, while also offering a simple toy model amenable to numerical methods beyond mean-field.</description>

      <title>Improving Spectral Resolution from Real-time Evolution for Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of numerically simulated spectra using real-time evolution methods for strongly correlated systems is affected by both the length of simulation time and the system size, limiting resolution in both frequency and momentum. In this work, we propose a computationally cheap, linear autoregressive machine learning-based framework to extend short-time and distance results over a wider range. We demonstrate the proposed method to extend the lesser Green's function for both the Hubbard model and the much more computationally challenging Hubbard-extended Holstein model. This technique significantly improves both the frequency and momentum resolution of the single-particle removal spectrum $\mathcal{A}(k,\omega)$, allowing observation of otherwise obscured spectral features due to electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a newly discovered magnetic phase, characterized by non-relativistic spin-splitting that has been experimentally observed. Here, we introduce a framework dubbed {\it spin-orbital altermagnetism} to achieve spin-orbital textures in altermagnetic materials. We identify two distinct classes of spin-orbital altermagnetism: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic type emerges from symmetry-compensated magnetic orders with spontaneously broken parity-time symmetry, while the extrinsic type stems from translational-symmetry breaking between sublattices, as exemplified by the Jahn-Teller-driven structural phase transition. In addition to directly measuring the spin-orbital texture, we propose spin conductivity and spin-resolved orbital polarization as effective methods for detecting these altermagnets. Additionally, a symmetry-breaking mechanism induces weak spin magnetization, further revealing the peculiar feature of spin-orbital altermagnetism. We also utilize the staggered susceptibility to illustrate a potential realization of this phase in a two-orbital interacting system. Our work provides a new platform to explore spin-orbital locked physics, extending the materials classes that may display complex spin textures from the standard $4d-5d$ compounds to $3d$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects on Magnetic Structure and Lattice Dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$, a quadruple perovskite oxide (AA'$_3$B$_4$O$_{12}$-type), has attracted attention for its notable bifunctional activity in oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Here, we systematically investigate the magnetic phase diagram and lattice dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ using two density functional theory plus Hubbard U (DFT + U) approaches: the spin-density and the charge-only-density formalism. Phase diagram analysis as a function of U and J shows that both methods stabilize the experimentally observed antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration (C-type AFM at the B-site and ferrimagnetic structure at the A'-site Mn ions) at U = 3.5 eV and J = 0.8 eV. These U and J values are consistent with those obtained from the constrained random phase approximation. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical stability of the AFM phase through phonon dispersion curves and analyze the Raman-active phonon modes. These results highlight the critical role of appropriate U and J parameters in accurately describing the properties of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Novel Quantum Spin Liquid states in the $S = {\frac{1}{2}}$ three-dimensional compound Y$_{3}$Cu$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ system Y$_{3}$Cu$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$ consists of two inequivalent Cu$^{2+}$ ions, each forming edge shared triangular lattices. Our magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)=M/H$, specific heat $C_p(T)$, $^{89}$Y nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on this system confirm the absence of any long-range magnetic ordering and the persistence of spin dynamics down to 0.077 K. From $^{89}$Y NMR we find evidence of a transition at about 120 K which we suggest to arise from a fraction of the spins condensing into a singlet (a valence bond solid VBS or a quantum spin liquid QSL) state. A plateau in the muon relaxation rate is observed between 60 K and 10 K (signifying the VBS/QSL state from a fraction of the spins) followed by an increase and another plateau below about 1 K (presumably signifying the VBS/QSL state from all the spins). Our density functional theory calculations find a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal with inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) ions alternately occupying the corners of the cube. All other near neighbour interactions between the Cu ions are also found to be antiferromagnetic and are thought to drive the frustration.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations in Two- and Three-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting momentum-resolved excitation spectra in strongly correlated quantum systems remains a major challenge, especially beyond one spatial dimension. We present an efficient tensor-network approach to compute dispersion relations via imaginary-time evolution within the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) framework. Benchmarking on the transverse-field Ising model, the method successfully captures dispersion relations in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases for two- and three-dimensional lattices, achieving strong agreement with series expansion methods, where these are applicable. Crucially, this work presents the first demonstration of dispersion relation calculations for three-dimensional quantum lattice models - a long-standing computational challenge that opens entirely new research frontiers. The method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, requiring only modest computational resources while maintaining high accuracy across wide parameter ranges. Its broad applicability makes it a powerful tool for quantum simulation, photonic material design, and quantum information platforms requiring precise momentum-resolved spectra.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and dynamics of quantum Hall bulk anyons in quadratic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-particle coherent states and their dynamics in the lowest Landau level (LLL) under the influence of quadratic potentials. We focus on generalized coherent states that describe Abelian anyons in the LLL and are associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We draw on parallels with quantum optics and symmetry properties of the coherent states considered here to analytically calculate quantities such as a bunching parameter, which depends on quantum statistics, as well as coherent state trajectories under the influence of generic quadratic potentials. Our results show that in unbounded saddle potentials, the bunching parameter governs the trajectories which show exponentially diverging behavior in a manner that depends on quantum statistics. In bounded elliptical potentials, the bunching parameter is oscillatory and its maximum magnitude depends on the eccentricity of the applied potential. We draw connections between our analyses and the key concepts that underlie anyon detection in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Berry Curvature Driven Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effect in Co$_2$MnSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals often exhibit unusual electronic and thermal transport due to nontrivial bulk band crossings, enabling simultaneous realization of large anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities ($\sigma_{xy}$ and $\alpha_{xy}$). Here, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the anomalous transport properties of ferromagnetic Co$_2$MnSn is reported. First-principles calculations reveal topological Weyl points producing significant Berry curvature, driving dominant intrinsic anomalous Hall/Nernst effects. Electronic and thermal transport measurements demonstrate robust anomalous transport with substantial conductivity values that persist at room temperature ($\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 500 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.3 A/m/K). We also show how the chemical substitution (via tuning Fermi level) can boost these effects (up to $\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 1376 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.49 A/m/K at 150 K). These findings position Co$_2$MnSn as a compelling platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and advancing next-generation thermoelectric and spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fermionic embezzlement of entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement allows to extract arbitrary entangled states from a suitable embezzling state using only local operations while perturbing the resource state arbitrarily little. A natural family of embezzling states is given by ground states of non-interacting, critical fermions in one spatial dimension. This raises the question of whether the embezzlement operations can be restricted to Gaussian operations whenever one only wishes to extract Gaussian entangled states. We show that this is indeed the case and prove that the embezzling property is in fact a generic property of fermionic Gaussian states. Our results provide a fine-grained understanding of embezzlement of entanglement for fermionic Gaussian states in the finite-size regime and thereby bridge finite-size systems to abstract characterizations based on the classification of von Neumann algebras. To prove our results, we establish novel bounds relating the distance of covariances to the trace-distance of Gaussian states, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Excitonic Insulator Signatures in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature phase of Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, a near-zero-gap semiconductor ($E_G$ = 0), is a promising candidate for an excitonic insulator. Given the dome-like evolution expected for an excitonic insulator around $E_G$, we investigated Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, the more semi-metallic Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, and semiconducting Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Our findings reveal a second-order structural phase transition from orthorhombic (space group: $Cmcm$) to monoclinic (space group: $C2/c$) in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, but no transition in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ down to 2 K. This transition breaks two mirror symmetries, enabling and enhancing the hybridization of Ta, Ni, and Se atoms, shortening bond lengths, and strengthening orbital interactions. NEXAFS data confirm stronger hybridization, significant changes in excitonic binding energies, and a key alteration in orbital character, suggesting an excitonic insulating state in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and emphasizing the crucial electronic role of orbitals in the formation of the excitonic insulator state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viewed through the lens of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we demonstrate that higher-form currents with nonzero ghost number also define higher-form symmetries, directly analogous to the standard higher-form symmetries with ghost number zero. These ghostly higher symmetries descend from and into conventional higher-form symmetries via chains of descent equations familiar from the theory of anomalies and topological field theories. We give examples of such chains of ghostly symmetries in Maxwell theory, Abelian and non-Abelian higher gauge theory, Yang-Mills theory, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>

      <title>Exploring confinement transitions in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories with dipolar atoms beyond one dimension</title>

Abstract: Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.</description>

Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the many-particle interactions produce intervalley scattering and drive an intervalley coherent state with spontaneous translation symmetry breaking. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Stripe order in quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of magnetic order in geometrically frustrated quasiperiodic systems, focusing on the interplay between local tile symmetry and frustration-induced constraints. In particular, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the two-dimensional Ammann--Beenker quasicrystal. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and general arguments, we map the phase diagram of the model. For small $J_2$, a N\'eel phase appears, whereas a stripe phase is stable for dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$, despite the system's lack of periodicity. Although long-range stripe order emerges below a critical temperature, unlike in random systems, it is softened by the nucleation of competing stripe domains pinned at specific quasiperiodic sites. This behavior reveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices, where geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine the magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to non-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and other broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has emerged as a competitive method for computing the ground states of many-body quantum systems. This method is particularly important for fermion systems where sign problems are abundant. We derive and explain the algorithms for the VMC calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation. As a separate key result, we prove the detailed balance of sequential sampling of tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Topological $X$-Gates via Braiding of Majorana Zero Modes in an Interacting Quantum Dot System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum dot platforms have opened new pathways for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and simulating topological quantum computation. Here we propose an experimentally feasible setup for implementing topological $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates in an interacting $Y$-shaped quantum-dot array. The proposed novel architecture enables both braiding and charge readout through simple fusion operations controlled by gate-tunable potentials. Using many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact diagonalization, we analyze the braiding and fusion dynamics of MZMs in the presence of nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder. We compute diabatic errors, braiding fidelity, and the time- and space-resolved electron and hole components of the local density of states to monitor the braiding process. Our results show that even weak interactions or pairing disorder induce oscillations in the braiding fidelity, thereby setting an upper bound on the braiding speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparing fusion outcomes before and after braiding provides a direct and experimentally accessible signature of the non-Abelian nature of MZMs in quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness, or ``magic'', offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic resources under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings. Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and magic saturation at time scales logarithmic in system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and stabilizer entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of conservation laws in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controlled way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. As a matter of principle, our work shows analytically how strong pairing can emerge from strong repulsion. We illustrate our method with two examples: a 2D Dirac model and a 1D tight binding model with two orbitals. In the latter case, using density matrix renormalization group, we show that the analytical theory indeed guided us to discover the parameter regime where p-wave pairing with order-1 strength is dominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under pressure, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. In both cases, we find a pronounced magnetostructural interplay that manifests, in particular, as anomalies in the lattice-parameter evolution with composition, deviating from Vegard's law. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work lays the foundation for studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>
