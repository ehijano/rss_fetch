      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-unique equilibrium measures and freezing phase transitions for matrix cocycles for negative $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-step matrix cocycle generated by a pair of non-negative parabolic matrices and study the equilibrium measures for $t\log \|\mathcal A\|$ as $t$ runs over the reals. We show that there is a freezing first order phase transition at some parameter value $t_c$ so that for $t&lt;t_{c}$ the equilibrium measure is non-unique and supported on the two fixed points, while for $t&gt;t_c$, the equilibrium measure is unique, non-atomic and fully supported. The phase transition closely resembles the classical Hofbauer example. In particular, our example shows that there may be non-unique equilibrium measures for negative $t$ even if the cocycle is strongly irreducible and proximal.</description>

      <title>Specification in Mahavier Systems via Closed Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two fundamental properties of topological dynamical systems, the specification property and the initial specification property, and explore their generalizations to the broader setting of CR-dynamical systems, where the dynamics are governed by closed relations rather than continuous functions. While these two properties are equivalent for many classical systems, we demonstrate that their generalizations to CR-dynamical systems often lead to distinct behaviors. Applying them to Mahavier dynamical systems, we introduce new specification-type properties. These generalized notions extend the classical theory and reveal rich structural differences in dynamical behavior. Moreover, each of the new properties reduces to the standard specification property when restricted to continuous functions.</description>

      <title>FitzHugh-Nagumo equation: from global dynamics to slow-fast system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We concentrate our attention on the qualitative study of the phase portraits of the three-parameter FitzHugh-Nagumo family and its compactification. We divide the study into three scenarios based on the parameters. One of the scenarios is characterised by the existence of a double-zero bifurcation with Z2 symmetry (a singularity of codimension two). In this case, we explicitly exhibit the pitchfork, Hopf, Belyakov, and double homoclinic bifurcation/transition curves unfolding the singularity of codimension two and plot the bifurcation diagrams. We bridge this analysis with the theory on the associated slow-fast family and the existence of canards. We complete our study with the global compactification of the phase portraits for the family under consideration. This study complements the work summarised in Georgescu, Rocsoreanu and Giurgic Teanu, "Global Bifurcations in FitzHugh-Nagumo Model", Trends in Mathematics: Bifurcations, Symmetry and Patterns (2003).</description>

      <title>Neural Hamiltonian Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization challenges inherent to this class of models.</description>

      <title>Effect of phase-lag on synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions both analytically and numerically in the presence of phase frustration ($\beta$). The higher order topology consists of pairwise and triadic couplings. The analytical framework for the investigation is based on the Ott-Antonsen ansatz which leads to a convenient low-dimensional model. Extensive bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation of the full networks are performed to explore the paths to synchronization. The combined analysis shows a complex dependence of the transition to synchronization on adaptation exponents, coupling strengths, phase lag parameter, and multilayer configuration. Various types of transitions to synchronization, namely continuous, tiered, and explosive, are exhibited by the system in different regions of the parameter space. In all the cases, a satisfactory match between the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation results is observed. The origin of different transitions to synchronization is clearly understood using the low-dimensional model. Exploration of a wide region of the parameter space suggests that the phase frustration parameter inhibits tired as well as explosive synchronization transitions for fixed triadic coupling strength ($K_2$). On the other hand, discontinuous transition is promoted by the phase frustration parameter for fixed pairwise coupling strength ($K_1$). Moreover, the exponent of the adaptation function with the pairwise coupling decreases the width of the hysteresis, despite the dominance of the higher-order coupling for fixed $\beta$ and $K_2$. While, the exponent of the function adapted with higher-order coupling shows the opposite effect, it promotes bistability in spite of dominance of pairwise coupling strength for fixed $\beta$, and $K_1$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove a new, more general version of the Morse index theorem for heteroclinic, homoclinic, and half-clinic solutions in general Lagrangian systems. In the final section, we compute the Morse index for specific heteroclinic and half-clinic solutions in classical mechanical models such as the mathematical pendulum, the Nagumo equation, and a four-dimensional competition-diffusion system.</description>

      <title>David regularity of the Yoccoz extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central problem in the study of critical circle dynamics is understanding the regularity of Yoccoz conjugators - circle homeomorphisms that conjugate critical circle maps with irrational rotation numbers to their corresponding rigid rotations. One can approach this problem from a different angle by studying the regularity of extensions of these maps to the unit disk. Of particular interest is the question of when such a conjugator admits a David extension. Building on the work of Petersen and Zakeri, we classify the David regularity of a specific extension process known as the Yoccoz extension.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the study of holomorphic correspondences as dynamical systems that can display behaviors of both rational maps and Kleinian groups has gained a good amount of attention. This phenomenon is related to the Sullivan dictionary, a list of parallels between the theories of these two systems. We build upon a surgical construction of such matings, due to Bullett and Harvey, increasing the degree of maps we consider, and proving regularity properties of the mating map on parameter spaces: namely, analyticity on the interior of its domain of definition, and continuity under quasiconformal rigidity on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, $\textit{Ra} \approx 31.8 \,\textit{Ta}^{1/2} - 4.43 \,\textit{Ta}^{5/12} + \mathcal{O}(\textit{Ta}^{1/3})$ for no-slip boundaries. However, we find that the linear onset in a finite cylinder differs noticeably compared to a Cartesian channel. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>Small-signal stability of power systems with voltage droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of research. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring small-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$ droop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of each bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter control strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The analysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex frequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the small-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power imbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design considerations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase theorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and lines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to established inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our conditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters that are misconfigured and cause instability.</description>
