      <title>Showing Ambiguity in the Pilot-Wave Theory Equations of Motion via the Derivation of Unique Scalar Fields Using a 2D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In De Broglie-Bohm Pilot-Wave Theory unique equations of motion and scalar fields for a particle can be formulated. This is done by finding a solution for a divergence free probability density current $\vec{J}(r,t)$ and then dividing by the Born Rule $|\vec{\Psi}(r,t)|^{2}$ for velocity arising from Hamilton-Jacobi mechanics. This addition of divergence free probability current would still satisfy the Schrodinger continuity equation. It was found that for a 2D polar system a divergence free probability density is the gradient rotated by the matrix ($S$) applied to a scalar field as such $S\vec{\nabla}\varphi(r)$. A variety of equations of motion were used such that the dimensions of the equations are equivalent to a velocity, different scalar fields were then derived for a 2D quantum harmonic oscillator. It was found that for each unique velocity there was a unique scalar field associated with it, as such the equation of motion for a particle in De Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory could be theoretically dependent on any arbitrary number of scalar fields. This ultimately means the equations of motion could be ambiguous as there are multiple mathematically valid solutions.</description>

      <title>Critical coupling constants for binding some quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When particles interact via two-body short-range central potential wells, binding can occur for some critical values of the coupling constants. Using the envelope theory, approximations for critical coupling constants are computed for quantum nonrelativistic systems containing identical particles and systems containing identical particles plus a different one.</description>

      <title>Localizing quantum fields with time-dependent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of localizing quantum field degrees of freedom by dynamically growing cavity walls through a time-dependent potential. We use our results to show that it is possible to do this without introducing non-negligible mixedness in localized modes of the field. We discuss how this addresses the concerns, raised in previous literature, that the high degree of entanglement of regular states in QFT may hinder relativistic quantum information protocols that make use of localized relativistic probes.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Chaos in a Nonlinear Wavefunction Model: An Alternative to Born's Probability Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a prior paper, the author described an instability in a nonlinear wavefunction model. Proposed in connection with the Measurement Problem, the model contained an external potential creating a ``classical'' instability. However, it is interesting to ask whether such models possess an intrinsic randomness -- even ``chaos" -- independent of external potentials. In this work, I investigate the criterion analytically and simulate from a small (``3 qubit") model, demonstrating that the Lyapunov exponent -- a standard measure of ``chaos" -- is positive. I also extend the instability criterion to models in the continuum. These results suggest that the boundary between classical and wavefunction physics may also constitute the threshold of chaos, and present an alternative to Max Born's ad hoc probability hypothesis: random outcomes in experiments result not from ``wave-particle duality" or ``the existence of the quantum," but from sensitive dependence on initial conditions, as is common in the other sciences.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Nested Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a representation of an n-qubit register that parameterizes its statevector as a series of nested entanglements. We show that the recursive substructure of this representation provides a natural framework for automating the construction of quantum circuits for state preparation. It also allows for a straightforward treatment of pure state separability. We discuss a novel derivation of uniformly controlled rotations and the quantum Fourier transform within this representation, and consider the effects of single-qubit basis changes on its overall structure. We end with a discussion of the apparent connection between the compressibility of the state description in this representation, and the circuit complexity required to prepare it.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Characterizing stationary optomechanical entanglement in the presence of non-Markovian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optomechanical system, where a mechanical oscillator interacts with a Gaussian input optical field. In the linearized picture, we analytically prove that if the input light field is the vacuum state, or is frequency-independently squeezed, the stationary entanglement between the oscillator and the output optical field is independent of the coherent coupling between them, which we refer to as the universality of entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement cannot be generated by performing arbitrary frequency-dependent squeezing on the input optical field. Our results hold in the presence of general, Gaussian environmental noise sources, including non-Markovian noise.</description>

      <title>Holevo Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for multi-parameter estimation in nonlinear interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the potential of quantum advantage to surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), the nonlinear interferometers have garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of precision measurement. However, many practical applications require multi-parameter estimation. In this work, we discuss the precision limit of multi-parameter estimation of pure Gaussian states based on nonlinear interferometers, and derive the Holevo Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound (HCRB) for the case where both modes undergo displacement estimation. Furthermore, we compare our analytical results with the quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD-CRB), and with the result of the dual homodyne measurement. Through numerical analysis, we find that the HCRB equals the result of the dual homodyne measurement, whereas SLD-CRB is not saturable at small squeezed parameters. Therefore, this indicates that the HCRB is tight. Additionally, we provide intuitive analysis and visual representation of our numerical results in phase space.</description>

      <title>Distribution Relationship of Quantum Battery Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution relationship of quantum battery capacity is investigated. First, it is proved that for two-qubit X-states, the sum of the subsystem battery capacities does not exceed the total system's battery capacity, and the conditions are provided under which they are equal. Then define the difference between the total system's and subsystems'battery capacities as the residual battery capacity (RBC) and show that this can be divided into coherent and incoherent components. Furthermore, it is observed that this capacity monogamy relation for quantum batteries extends to general n-qubit X states and any n-qubit X state's battery capacity distribution can be optimized to achieve capacity gain through an appropriate global unitary evolution. Specifically, for general three-qubit X states, stronger distributive relations are derived for battery capacity. Quantum batteries are believed to hold significant potential for outperforming classical counterparts in the future. These findings contribute to the development and enhancement of quantum battery theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear entanglement detection strategy which detects entanglement that the linear detection strategy fails. We show that when the nonlinear entanglement detection strategy fails to detect the entanglement of an entangled state with two copies, it may succeed with three or more copies. Based on our strategy, a witness combined with a suitable quanutm mechanical observable may detect the entanglement that can not be detected by the witness alone. Moreover, our strategy can also be applied to detect multipartite entanglement by using the witnesses for bipartite systems, as well as to entanglement concentrations.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity initialization a logical qubit with multiple injections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction represents a significant advancement in large-scale quantum computing. However, achieving fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford logical gates with reduced overhead remains a challenge in the popular surface code strategy. Recent advances have underscored the need for a substantial code distance to attain complete fault tolerance. Here, we introduce a continuous fault-tolerant scheme for non-Clifford logical gates via multiple injections. Unlike existing protocols that focus on a single logical chain, our approach utilizes multiple logical chains, each can employ the same or different logical rotation angles, to initialize a non-Clifford state. Compared to previous efforts, our protocol significantly alleviates the challenges associated with the requirement for a large code distance and reduces the corresponding resource overhead, making it more feasible to be implemented in current mid-scale chips via the surface code strategy.</description>

      <title>Certified Random Number Generation using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, quantum technologies have made significant strides toward achieving quantum utility. However, practical applications are hindered by challenges related to scaling the number of qubits and the depth of circuits. In this paper, we investigate how current quantum computers can be leveraged for practical applications, particularly in generating secure random numbers certified by Quantum Mechanics. While random numbers can be generated and certified in a device-independent manner through the violation of Bell's inequality, this method requires significant spatial separation to satisfy the no-signaling condition, making it impractical for implementation on a single quantum computer. Instead, we employ temporal correlations to generate randomness by violating the Leggett-Garg inequality, which relies on the No-Signaling in Time condition to certify randomness, thus overcoming spatial constraints. By applying this protocol to existing quantum computers, we demonstrate the feasibility of secure, semi-device-independent random number generation using low-depth circuits with single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Universality of stationary entanglement in an optomechanical system driven by non-Markovian noise and squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems subjected to environmental noise give rise to rich physical phenomena. We investigate entanglement between a mechanical oscillator and the reflected coherent optical field in a general, not necessarily Markovian environment. For the input optical field, we consider stationary Gaussian states and frequency dependent squeezing. We demonstrate that for a coherent laser drive, either unsqueezed or squeezed in a frequency-independent manner, optomechanical entanglement is destroyed after a threshold that depends only on the environmental noises -- independent of the coherent coupling between the oscillator and the optical field, or the squeeze factor. In this way, we have found a universal entangling-disentangling transition. We also show that for a configuration in which the oscillator and the reflected field are separable, entanglement cannot be generated by incorporating frequency-dependent squeezing in the optical field.</description>

      <title>Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy production in the Di\'osi-Penrose (DP) model, one of the most extensively studied gravity-related collapse mechanisms, and one of its dissipative extensions. To this end, we analyze the behavior of a single harmonic oscillator, subjected to such collapse mechanisms, focusing on its phase-space dynamics and the time evolution of the entropy production rate, a central quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Our findings reveal that the original DP model induces unbounded heating, producing dynamics consistent with the Second Law of thermodynamics only under the assumption of an infinite-temperature noise field. In contrast, its dissipative extension achieves physically consistent thermalization in the regime of low dissipation strength. We further our study to address the complete dynamics of the dissipative extension, thus including explicitly non-Gaussian features in the state of the system that lack from the low-dissipation regime, using a short-time approach.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement of a bipartite system portrayed in a (3+1)D compact Minkowski manifold; quadridistances and quadrispeeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In special relativity, trajectories of particles, whether massive or massless, in 4D, can be displayed in the 3+1 Minkowski space-time manifold. On the other hand, in quantum mechanics, trajectories in phase space are not strictly defined because coordinate and linear momentum cannot be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision, as these variables do not commute with each other. They are not sharply defined within Hilbert space formalism. Nonetheless, out of the density matrix representing a quantum system the extracted information still yields an enhanced description of its properties, and by arranging adequately the matrix one can acquire additional information from its content. Following these lines of conduct, this paper focuses on a closely related issue, the definition and meaning of velocity and speed of a typical quantum phenomenon, the disentanglement for a bipartite system when its evolution is displayed in a 4D pseudo-space-time, whose coordinates are combinations of the density matrix entries. Formalism is based on the definition of a compact Minkowski manifold, where trajectories are defined using the same reasoning of special relativity in the Minkowski manifold. The space-like and time-like regions acquire different meanings, termed entangled-like and separable-like, respectively. The definition and meaning of velocity and speed of disentanglement follow naturally from the formalism. Depending on the dynamics of the physical system state, trajectories may go forth and back from entanglement to separability regions of the compact Minkowski manifold. When the physical time t is introduced as an intrinsic variable into the formalism, a phenomenon commonly known as sudden death occurs during irreversible evolution when a state that is initially entangled becomes separable.</description>

      <title>Luminescence thermometry based on photon emitters in nanophotonic silicon waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable measurement and accurate control of the temperature within nanophotonic devices is a key prerequisite for their application in both classical and quantum technologies. Established approaches use sensors that are attached in proximity to the components, which only offers a limited spatial resolution and thus impedes the measurement of local heating effects. Here, we therefore study an alternative temperature sensing technique that is based on measuring the luminescence of erbium emitters directly integrated into nanophotonic silicon waveguides. To cover the entire temperature range from 295 K to 2 K, we investigate two different approaches: The thermal activation of non-radiative decay channels for temperatures above 200 K and the thermal depopulation of spin- and crystal field levels at lower temperatures. The achieved sensitivity is 0.22(4) %/K at room temperature and increases up to 420(50) %/K at approximately 2 K. Within a few-minute measurement interval, we thus achieve a measurement precision that ranges from 0.04(1) K at the lowest studied temperature to 6(1) K at ambient conditions. In the future, the measurement time can be further reduced by optimizing the excitation pulse sequence and the fiber-to-chip coupling efficiency. Combining this with spatially selective implantation promises precise thermometry from ambient to cryogenic temperatures with a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers.</description>

      <title>Gain of squeezing via photon subtractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for generating a more squeezed than single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state by subtracting 2,4,6 photons from it. In general, the more photons are subtracted, the more gain of the squeezing (more of 3 dB) is observed in the measurement-induced continuous variable (CV) states of definite parity. However, the two-photon subtraction strategy is practically preferred. It can be implemented with higher success probability, wider squeezing gain width ~ 5 dB and least quadrature variance in the corresponding range of initial squeezing. We demonstrate the mitigating effect of a photon-number resolving (PNR) detector with non-unit quantum efficiency on the output characteristics of the measurement-induced CV states, resulting in their slight decrease compared to ideal photon subtraction. Use of a single photon in addition to the SMSV state at beam splitter (BS) input with subsequent registration of odd number of photons (say, 3 photons) allows the implementation of the measurement-induced even CV state which is several times brighter than the initial state and has lower quadrature noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents new constructions of quantum error correcting Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS for short) codes. These codes are mainly obtained by Sloane's classical combinations of linear codes applied here to the case of self-orthogonal linear codes. A new algebraic decoding technique is also introduced. This technique is exemplified on CSS codes obtained from BCH, Reed-Muller and projective geometry codes.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamic Cost of Ignorance: Thermal State Preparation with One Ancilla Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate a model of thermalization wherein a single ancillary qubit randomly interacts with the system to be thermalized. This not only sheds light on the emergence of Gibbs states in nature, but also provides a routine for preparing arbitrary thermal states on a digital quantum computer. For desired $\beta$ and random interaction $G$ the routine boils down to time independent Hamiltonian simulation and is represented by the channel $\Phi : \rho \mapsto \mathbb{E}_G {\rm Tr}_{\rm Env} \left[ e^{-i(H + \alpha G)t} \left(\rho \otimes \frac{e^{-\beta H_E}}{\mathcal{Z}}\right) e^{i (H + \alpha G)t} \right]$. We rigorously prove that these dynamics reduce to a Markov chain process in the weak-coupling regime with the thermal state as the approximate fixed point. We upper bound the total simulation time required in terms of the Markov chain spectral gap $\lambda_\star$, which we compute exactly in the ground state limit. These results are independent of any eigenvalue knowledge of the system, but we are further able to show that with knowledge of eigenvalue differences $\lambda_S(i) - \lambda_S(j)$, then the total simulation time is dramatically reduced. The ratio of the complete ignorance simulation cost to the perfect knowledge simulation cost scales as $\widetilde{O} \left({\frac{\|{H_S}\|^7}{\delta_{\rm min}^7 \epsilon^{3.5} \lambda_\star(\beta)^{3.5}}}\right)$, where $\delta_{\min}$ is related to the eigenvalue differences of the system. Additionally, we provide more specific results for single qubit and harmonic oscillator systems as well as numeric experiments with hydrogen chains. In addition to the algorithmic merits, these results can be viewed as broad extensions of the Repeated Interactions model to generic Hamiltonians with unknown interactions, giving a complete picture of the thermalization process for quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement and qubit error rate dependence on the exciton-phonon coupling in self-assembled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. In particular, for key distributions, a near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is one of the requirements for minimizing the qubit error rates. In this work, we theoretically investigate the polarization entangled photon pairs emitted by a quantum-dot radiative cascade embedded in a micropillar cavity. We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol to investigate the qubit error rate for the given degree of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that the measurement-induced transition can be detected using a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional.</description>

      <title>Contextuality with Pauli observables in cycle scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a fundamental marker of quantum non-classicality, which has emerged as a key resource for quantum computational advantage in multiple settings. Many such results hinge specifically on contextuality witnessed through Pauli measurements. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of (state-dependent) Pauli contextuality, focusing on cycle measurement scenarios, the simplest scenarios capable of exhibiting contextual behaviour. First, we study realizability of cycle scenarios with multi-qubit Pauli observables: we show that the maximum size of a cycle faithfully realizable by $m$-qubit Paulis is upper bounded by $3m$, while we construct explicit realizations of cycles of size $2m-1$ or $2m$, depending on whether $m \not\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ or $m \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. Then, we investigate the presence of contextuality: we prove that no $n$-cycle Pauli realization for $n &gt; 4$ can witness contextuality (on any quantum state), whereas for $n = 4$ every Pauli realization exhibits contextuality, attaining the quantum bound for all noncontextuality inequalities on some pure state. Finally, we discuss arbitrary Pauli scenarios in light of Vorob'ev's theorem, and show that, contrary to what our cycle characterization might suggest, the presence of $4$-cycles is not necessary for witnessing contextuality in general Pauli scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lindblad synthesis for noise model construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective noise models are essential for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of quantum systems, particularly in applications like quantum error mitigation and correction. However, even when noise processes are well-characterized in isolation, the effective noise channels impacting target quantum operations can differ significantly, as different gates experience noise in distinct ways. Here, we present a noise model construction method that builds an effective model from a Lindbladian description of the physical noise processes acting simultaneously to the desired gate operation. It employs the Magnus expansion and Dyson series, and can be utilized for both low-order symbolic and high-order numerical approximations of the noise channel of a multi-qubit quantum gate. We envision multiple use cases of our noise construction method such as (i) computing the corresponding noise channel from a learned Lindbladian, and (ii) generating the noise channel starting with physically motivated Lindbladians for a given hardware architecture. In doing so, we close the gap between physical Lindbladians and operational level noise model parameters. We demonstrate a strong agreement between our symbolic noise construction and full numerical Lindblad simulations for various two-qubit gates, in isolation and in three- and four-qubit scenarios, for a variety of physically motivated noise sources. Our symbolic construction provides a useful breakdown of how noise model parameters depend on the underlying physical noise parameters, which gives qualitative insight into the structure of errors. For instance, our theory provides insight into the interplay of Lindblad noise with the intended gate operations, and can predict how local Lindblad noise can effectively spread into multi-qubit error.</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability functions for deterministic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $n$, controlled by reliability exponents $E_1,E_2 \geq 0$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $E_1,E_2&gt;0$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Shift Rule in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are key techniques for efficient gradient estimation in variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs). In this paper, we propose its Bayesian variant, where Gaussian processes with appropriate kernels are used to estimate the gradient of the VQE objective. Our Bayesian PSR offers flexible gradient estimation from observations at arbitrary locations with uncertainty information and reduces to the generalized PSR in special cases. In stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the flexibility of Bayesian PSR allows the reuse of observations in previous steps, which accelerates the optimization process. Furthermore, the accessibility to the posterior uncertainty, along with our proposed notion of gradient confident region (GradCoRe), enables us to minimize the observation costs in each SGD step. Our numerical experiments show that the VQE optimization with Bayesian PSR and GradCoRe significantly accelerates SGD and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including sequential minimal optimization.</description>

      <title>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of rotation on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</description>

      <title>Observational signature of Lorentz violation in acceleration radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Lorentz violation (LV) has emerged as a vibrant area of research in fundamental physics. Despite predictions from quantum gravity theories that Lorentz symmetry may break down at Planck-scale energies, which are currently beyond experimental reach, its low-energy signatures could still be detectable through alternative methods. In this paper, we propose a quantum optical approach to investigate potential LV effects on the acceleration radiation of a freely falling atom within a black hole spacetime coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field. Our proposed experimental setup employs a Casimir-type apparatus, wherein a two-level atom serves as a dipole detector, enabling its interaction with the field to be modeled using principles from quantum optics. We demonstrate that LV can introduce distinct quantum signatures into the radiation flux, thereby significantly modulating particle emission rates. It is found that while LV effects are negligible at high mode frequencies, they become increasingly pronounced at lower frequencies. This suggests that detecting LV at low-energy scales may depend on advancements in low-frequency observational techniques or detectors.</description>

      <title>Implementing Large Quantum Boltzmann Machines as Generative AI Models for Dataset Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineering of solid-state materials without external driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of a low-temperature normal Fermi gas with contact interactions: an exact perturbative expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic quantum nature of jets and the Quark-Gluon Plasma makes the study of jet quenching a promising candidate to benefit from quantum computing power. Standing as a precursor of the full study of this phenomenon, we study the propagation of SU(3) partons in Quark-Gluon Plasma using quantum simulation algorithms. The algorithms are developed in detail, and the propagation of both quarks and gluons is analysed and compared with analytical expectations. The results, obtained with quantum simulators, demonstrate that the algorithm successfully simulates parton propagation, yielding results consistent with analytical baseline calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales. In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: We prove that certain classical cyclic redundancy check codes can be used for classical error correction and not just classical error detection. We extend the idea of classical cyclic redundancy check codes to quantum cyclic redundancy check codes. This allows us to construct quantum stabiliser codes which can correct burst errors where the burst length attains the quantum Reiger bound. We then consider a certain family of quantum cyclic redundancy check codes for which we present a fast linear time decoding algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We consider communication scenarios where one party sends quantum states of known dimensionality $D$, prepared with an untrusted apparatus, to another, distant party, who probes them with uncharacterized measurement devices. We prove that, for any ensemble of reference pure quantum states, there exists one such prepare-and-measure scenario and a linear functional $W$ on its observed measurement probabilities, such that $W$ can only be maximized if the preparations coincide with the reference states, modulo a unitary or an anti-unitary transformation. In other words, prepare-and-measure scenarios allow one to "self-test" arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states. Arbitrary extreme $D$-dimensional quantum measurements, or sets thereof, can be similarly self-tested. Our results rely on a robust generalization of Wigner's theorem, a well-known result in particle physics that characterizes physical symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular error mitigation protocol for running $\mathsf{BQP}$ computations on a quantum computer with time-dependent noise. Utilising existing tools from quantum verification and measurement-based quantum computation, our protocol interleaves standard computation rounds alongside test rounds for noise sampling and inherits an exponential bound (in the number of circuit runs) on the probability that a returned classical output is correct. We introduce a post-selection technique called \textit{basketing} to address time-dependent noise and reduce overhead. The result is an error mitigation protocol which requires minimal noise assumptions, making it straightforwardly implementable on existing, NISQ devices. We perform a demonstration of the protocol using classical noisy simulation, presenting a universal measurement pattern which directly maps to (and can be tiled on) the heavy-hex layout of current IBM hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results in relativistic quantum information and quantum thermodynamics have independently shown that in the quantum regime, a system may fail to thermalise when subject to quantum-controlled application of the same, single thermalisation channel. For example, an accelerating system with fixed proper acceleration is known to thermalise to an acceleration-dependent temperature, known as the Unruh temperature. However, the same system in a superposition of spatially translated trajectories that share the same proper acceleration fails to thermalise. Here, we provide an explanation of these results using the framework of quantum field theory in relativistic noninertial reference frames. We show how a probe that accelerates in a superposition of spatial translations interacts with incommensurate sets of field modes. In special cases where the modes are orthogonal (for example, when the Rindler wedges are translated in a direction orthogonal to the plane of motion), thermalisation does indeed result, corroborating the here provided explanation. We then discuss how this description relates to an information-theoretic approach aimed at studying quantum aspects of temperature through quantum-controlled thermalisations. The present work draws a connection between research in quantum information, relativistic physics, and quantum thermodynamics, in particular showing that relativistic quantum effects can provide a natural realisation of quantum thermodynamical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-electron interference in free space using two laser-triggered needle tips as independent electron sources, a fermionic realisation of the landmark Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometer. We calculate the two-electron interference pattern in a quantum path formalism taking into account the fermionic nature and the spin configuration of the electrons. We also estimate the Coulomb repulsion in the setup in a semiclassical approach. We find that antibunching resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and repulsion stemming from the Coulomb interaction can be clearly distinguished.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the \emph{robust shallow shadows protocol}. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

Abstract: Extensive research has been dedicated to the asymptotic theory of quantum metrology, where the goal is to determine the ultimate precision limit of quantum channel estimation when many accesses to the channel are allowed. The ultimate limit has been well established, but in general noiseless and controllable ancilla is required for attaining it. Little is known about the metrological performance without noiseless ancilla, which is more relevant in practical circumstances. In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework to address this problem, bridging quantum metrology and the asymptotic theory of quantum channels. Leveraging this framework, we prove sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated applications of the channel to estimate, both with and without applying interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an algorithm to identify explicitly the control operation.</description>

      <title>Learning with SASQuaTCh: a Novel Variational Quantum Transformer Architecture with Kernel-Based Self-Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent exploding growth in size of state-of-the-art machine learning models highlights a well-known issue where exponential parameter growth, which has grown to trillions as in the case of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), leads to training time and memory requirements which limit their advancement in the near term. The predominant models use the so-called transformer network and have a large field of applicability, including predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to the dynamics of physical systems. Here we present a variational quantum circuit architecture named Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), which builds networks of qubits that perform analogous operations of the transformer network, namely the keystone self-attention operation, and leads to an exponential improvement in parameter complexity and run-time complexity over its classical counterpart. Our approach leverages recent insights from kernel-based operator learning in the context of predicting spatiotemporal systems to represent deep layers of a vision transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms. To validate our approach, we consider image classification tasks in simulation and with hardware, where with only 9 qubits and a handful of parameters we are able to simultaneously embed and classify a grayscale image of handwritten digits with high accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative optimal control method of quantum systems, aimed at an implementation of a desired operation with optimal fidelity. The update step of the method is based on the linear response of the fidelity to the control operators, and its projection onto the mode functions of the corresponding operator. Our method extends methods such as gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) and variational quantum algorithms, by determining the fidelity gradient in a hyperparameter-free manner, and using it for a multiparameter update, capitalizing on the multimode overlap of the perturbation and the mode functions. This directly reduces the number of dynamical trajectories that need to be evaluated in order to update a set of parameters. We demonstrate this approach, and compare it to the standard GRAPE algorithm, for the example of a quantum gate on two qubits, demonstrating a clear improvement in convergence and optimal fidelity of the generated protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic cooling can be used to find correlated states of many-body quantum systems. It is based on quantum circuits that perform nonunitary operations, whose implementation can be challenging on near-term quantum computers. In this work we develop a method that uses inherent qubit noise to implement nonunitary operations and algorithmic cooling. In our approach, qubit decay during quantum computation is used to simulate dissipation of auxiliary-spin bath, which cools down a simulated system towards its ground state. We test the algorithm on IBM-Q devices and demonstrate the relaxation of system spins to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering, controlled by the definition of the system Hamiltonian. The ordering is stable as long as the algorithm is run. We are able to perform cooling and state stabilization for global systems of up to three system spins and four auxiliary spins. Our work paves the way for useful quantum simulations of many-body quantum systems on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithms for Logistics Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a job shop scheduling problem for an automatized robot in a high-throughput laboratory and a travelling salesperson problem with recently proposed digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO)algorithms. In DCQO, we find the solution of an optimization problem via an adiabatic quantum dynamics, which is accelerated with counterdiabatic protocols. Thereafter, we digitize the global unitary to encode it in a digital quantum computer. For the job-shop scheduling problem, we aim at finding the optimal schedule for a robot executing a number of tasks under specific constraints, such that the total execution time of the process is minimized. For the traveling salesperson problem, the goal is to find the path that covers all cities and is associated with the shortest traveling distance. We consider both hybrid and pure versions of DCQO algorithms and benchmark the performance against digitized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In comparison to QAOA, the DCQO solution is improved by several orders of magnitude in success probability using the same number of two-qubit gates. Moreover, we implement our algorithms on cloud-based superconducting and trapped-ion quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that circuit compression using counterdiabatic protocols is amenable to current NISQ hardware and can solve logistics scheduling problems, where other digital quantum algorithms show insufficient performance.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions with electric dipole moment and position-dependent mass in the presence of a magnetic field generated by magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the bound-state solutions for Dirac fermions with electric dipole moment (EDM) and position-dependent mass (PDM) in the presence of a radial magnetic field generated by magnetic monopoles. To achieve this, we work with the $(2+1)$-dimensional (DE) Dirac equation with nonminimal coupling in polar coordinates. Posteriorly, we obtain a second-order differential equation via quadratic DE. Solving this differential equation through a change of variable and the asymptotic behavior, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation. From this, we obtain the bound-state solutions of the system, given by the two-component Dirac spinor and by the relativistic energy spectrum. So, we note that such spinor is written in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials, and such spectrum (for a fermion and an antifermion) is quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the EDM $d$, PDM parameter $\kappa$, magnetic charge density $\lambda_m$, and on the spinorial parameter $s$. In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of $\kappa$ (i.e., $\kappa$ acts as a kind of ``external field or potential''). Besides, we also analyze the nonrelativistic limit of our results, that is, we also obtain the nonrelativistic bound-state solutions. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we discuss in detail the characteristics of the spectrum as well as graphically analyze its behavior as a function of $\kappa$ and $\lambda_m$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Validity condition for high-fidelity Digitized Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digitizing an adiabatic evolution is a strategy able to combine the good performance of gate-based quantum processors with the advantages of adiabatic algorithms, providing then a hybrid model for efficient quantum information processing. In this work we develop validity conditions for high fidelity digital adiabatic tasks. To this end, we assume a digitizing process based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which allows us to introduce a Digitized Adiabatic Theorem. As consequence of this theorem, we show that the performance of such a hybrid model is limited by the fundamental constraints on the adiabatic theorem validity, even in ideal quantum processors. We argue how our approach predicts the existence of intrinsic non-adiabatic errors reported by R. Barends et al., Nature 534, 222 (2016) through an empirical study of digital annealing. In addition, our approach allows us to explain the existence of a scaling of the number of Suzuki-Trotter blocks for the optimal digital circuit with respect to the optimal adiabatic total evolution time, as reported by G. B. Mbeng et al., Phys. Rev. B 100, 224201 (2019) through robust numerical analysis of digital annealing. We illustrate our results through two examples of digitized adiabatic algorithms, namely, the two-qubits exact-cover problem and the three-qubits adiabatic factorization of the number 21.</description>

      <title>Faster computation of nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of nonstabilizerness is fruitful due to its application in gate synthesis and classical simulation. In particular, the resource monotone called the stabilizer extent is a useful tool to estimate the simulation cost using rank-based simulators, one of the state-of-the-art simulators of Clifford+$T$ circuits. In this work, we propose faster numerical algorithms to compute the stabilizer extent. Our algorithm utilizes the Column Generation method, which iteratively updates the subset of pure stabilizer states used for calculation. This subset is selected based on the overlaps between all stabilizer states and a target state. In order to update the subset, we make use of a newly proposed subroutine for calculating the stabilizer fidelity that (i) achieves linear time complexity with respect to the number of stabilizer states, (ii) super-exponentially reduces the space complexity by in-place calculation, and (iii) prunes unnecessary states for the computation. As a result, our algorithm can compute the stabilizer fidelity and the stabilizer extent for Haar random pure states up to $n=9$ qubits, which naively requires a memory of 305 EiB. We further show that our algorithm runs faster when the target state vector is real. We prove that the problem size is reduced by $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ compared to the general cases, which makes it computable for the case of $n=10$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Cheaper and more noise-resilient quantum state preparation using eigenvector continuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace methods are powerful, noise-resilient methods that can effectively prepare ground states on quantum computers. The challenge is to get a subspace with a small condition number that spans the states of interest using minimal quantum resources. In this work, we will use eigenvector continuation (EC) to build a subspace from the low-lying states of a set of Hamiltonians. The basis vectors are prepared using truncated versions of standard state preparation methods such as imaginary time evolution (ITE), adiabatic state preparation (ASP), and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). By using these truncated methods combined with eigenvector continuation, we can directly improve upon them, obtaining more accurate ground state energies at a reduced cost. We use several spin systems to demonstrate convergence even when methods like ITE and ASP fail, such as ASP in the presence of level crossings and ITE with vanishing energy gaps. We also showcase the noise resilience of this approach beyond the gains already made by having shallower quantum circuits. Our findings suggest that eigenvector continuation can be used to improve existing state preparation methods in the near term.</description>

      <title>Beating the natural Grover bound for low-energy estimation and state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating ground state energies of many-body Hamiltonians is a central task in many areas of quantum physics. In this work, we give quantum algorithms which, given any $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$, compute an estimate for the ground state energy and prepare a quantum state achieving said energy, respectively. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of $H$ within additive error $\varepsilon M$, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, $M$ is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the runtime of our algorithms scales as $2^{cn/2}$ for $c&lt;1$, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking a standard square root Grover speedup for unstructured search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that an extensive fraction of the interactions can be neglected with a controlled error. What this ultimately implies is that even arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonians have structure in their low energy space, in the form of an exponential-dimensional low energy subspace.</description>

      <title>Operational simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of bipartite states via one-sided semi-device-independent steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a different form of quantum steering, i.e., certification of quantum steering in a one-sided semi-device-independent way, has been formulated [Jebarathinam \etal Phys. Rev. A 108, 042211 (2023)]. In this work, we use this phenomenon to provide operational simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases as quantified by the measures in [Wu \etal Scientific Reports 4, 4036 (2014)]. First, we show that for any bipartite state, such measure of simultaneous correlations in two mutually unbiased bases can be operationally identified as exhibiting one-sided semi-device-independent steering in a two-setting scenario. Next, we demonstrate that for two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides an operational quantification of information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. Then, we provide a different classification of two-qubit separable states with the above-mentioned information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases and the quantification of one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. Finally, we invoke quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to shed intuitions on the operational characterization of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states via one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. This provides us with a geometric visualization of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip magnetic field sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond requires scalable integration of 3D waveguides into diamond substrates. Here, we develop a sensing array device with an ensemble of shallow implanted NV centers integrated with arrays of laser-written waveguides for excitation and readout of NV signals. Our approach enables an easy-to-operate on-chip magnetometer with a pixel size proportional to the Gaussian mode area of each waveguide. The performed continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance on each waveguide gives an average dc-sensitivity value of $195 \pm 3 {nT}/\sqrt{Hz}$, which can be improved with lock-in-detection or pulsed-microwave sequences. We apply a magnetic field to separate the four NV crystallographic orientations of the magnetic resonance and then utilize a DC current through a straight wire antenna close to the waveguide to prove the sensor capabilities of our device. We reconstruct the complete vector magnetic field in the NV crystal frame using three different NV crystallographic orientations. By knowing the polarization axis of the waveguide mode, we project the magnetic field vector into the lab frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the sensitivity of light-pulse atom interferometers progressively relies on large-momentum transfer techniques. Precise control of such methods is imperative to exploit the full capabilities of these quantum sensors. One key element is the mitigation of deleterious effects such as parasitic paths deteriorating the interferometric signal. In this Letter, we present the experimental realization of dichroic mirror pulses for atom interferometry, its scalability to higher-order Bragg diffraction, and its robustness against initial momentum spread. Our approach selectively reflects resonant atom paths into the detected interferometer output, ensuring that these contribute to the signal with intent. Simultaneously, parasitic paths are efficiently transmitted by the mirror and not directed to the relevant interferometer outputs. This method effectively isolates the desired interferometric signal from noise induced by unwanted paths. It can be readily applied to existing setups capable of higher-order Bragg diffraction.</description>

      <title>Impact of time-retarded noise on dynamical decoupling schemes for qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the simplest and least resource-intensive methods to suppress decoherence for qubit operations, namely, dynamical decoupling (DD), is investigated for a broad range of realistic noise sources with time-retarded feedback. By way of example, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence is analyzed in a numerically rigorous manner accounting also for correlations between qubits and environments. Since experimentally noise sources are characterized through spectral densities, we adopt the spin-boson model as a suitable framework to describe the qubit dynamics under DD for a given spectral density $J(\omega) \propto \omega^s$. Motivated by the situation for superconducting qubits, the spectral exponent $s$ is varied from $s=1$ (Ohmic bath) to a substantially small value $0 &lt; s \ll 1$ (deep sub-Ohmic bath), in order to investigate the impact of time-nonlocal back action on DD performances for enhanced coherence times. As reference to the DD schemes, dynamics of a single qubit subject to Ramsey sequences without any pules and Hahn echo (HE) sequences are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Impact of Quasiparticles and Two-Level Systems on the Statistics of Superconducting Qubit Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09926</link>

Abstract: Temporal fluctuations in the superconducting qubit lifetime, $T_1$, bring up additional challenges in building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. While the exact mechanisms remain unclear, $T_1$ fluctuations are generally attributed to the strong coupling between the qubit and a few near-resonant two-level systems (TLSs) that can exchange energy with an assemble of thermally fluctuating two-level fluctuators (TLFs) at low frequencies. Here, we report $T_1$ measurements on the qubits with different geometrical footprints and surface dielectrics as a function of the temperature. By analyzing the noise spectrum of the qubit depolarization rate, $\Gamma_1 = 1/T_1$, we can disentangle the impact of TLSs, non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs), and equilibrium (thermally excited) QPs on the variance in $\Gamma_1$. We find that $\Gamma_1$ variances in the qubit with a small footprint are more susceptible to the QP and TLS fluctuations than those in the large-footprint qubits. Furthermore, the QP-induced variances in all qubits are consistent with the theoretical framework of QP diffusion and fluctuation. We suggest these findings can offer valuable insights for future qubit design and engineering optimization.</description>

      <title>A New World in the Depths of Microcrypt: Separating OWSGs and Quantum Money from QEFID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While in classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are widely regarded as the "minimal assumption," the situation in quantum cryptography is less clear. Recent works have put forward two concurrent candidates for the minimal assumption in quantum cryptography: One-way state generators (OWSGs), postulating the existence of a hard search problem with an efficient verification algorithm, and EFI pairs, postulating the existence of a hard distinguishing problem. Two recent papers [Khurana and Tomer STOC'24; Batra and Jain FOCS'24] showed that OWSGs imply EFI pairs, but the reverse direction remained open. In this work, we give strong evidence that the opposite direction does not hold: We show that there is a quantum unitary oracle relative to which EFI pairs exist, but OWSGs do not. In fact, we show a slightly stronger statement that holds also for EFI pairs that output classical bits (QEFID). As a consequence, we separate, via our oracle, QEFID, and one-way puzzles from OWSGs and several other Microcrypt primitives, including efficiently verifiable one-way puzzles and unclonable state generators. In particular, this solves a problem left open in [Chung, Goldin, and Gray Crypto'24]. Using similar techniques, we also establish a fully black-box separation (which is slightly weaker than an oracle separation) between private-key quantum money schemes and QEFID pairs. One conceptual implication of our work is that the existence of an efficient verification algorithm may lead to qualitatively stronger primitives in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Measurement time of weak measurements on large entangled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that starting only with strong, projective quantum measurements, experiments can be designed to allow weak measurements, which lead to random walk between the possible final measurement outcomes. However, one can ask the reverse question: starting with only weak measurements, can all the results of standard strong measurements be recovered? Prior work has shown that some results can be, such as the Born rule for the probability of measurement outcomes as a function of wave intensity. In this paper we show that another crucial result can be reproduced by purely weak measurements, namely the collapse of a many-body, nonlocally entangled wave function on a time scale comparable to the characteristic time of a single, local measurement; for an entangled state of a single excitation among $N$ qubits, we find the collapse time scales as a double logarithm of $N$. This result affirms the self-consistency of the hypothesis that spontaneous weak measurements lie at the base of all physical measurements, independent of human observers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Key Distribution with Entanglement Distillation and Classical Advantage Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing secure communication between distant parties is one of quantum technology's main goals. Although quantum key distribution promises information-theoretic security for sharing a secret key, the key rate heavily depends on the level of noise in the quantum channel. To overcome the noise, both quantum and classical techniques exist, i.e., entanglement distillation and classical advantage distillation. So far, these techniques have only been used separately from each other. Herein, we present a two-stage distillation scheme concatenating entanglement distillation with classical advantage distillation. For advantage distillation, we utilize a fixed protocol, specifically, the repetition code; in the case of entanglement distillation, we employ an enumeration algorithm to find the optimal protocol. We test our scheme for different noisy entangled states and demonstrate its quantitative advantage: our two-stage distillation scheme achieves finite key rates even in the high-noise regime where entanglement distillation or advantage distillation alone cannot afford key sharing. We also calculate the security bounds for relevant QKD protocols with our key distillation scheme and show that they exceed the previous security bounds with only advantage distillation. Since the advantage distillation part does not introduce further requirements on quantum resources, the proposed scheme is well-suited for near-term quantum key distribution tasks.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark states, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not have to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for super-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions (perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>End-to-end QKD network with non-localized trust</title>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wave Simulation with Sources and Loss Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating linear, anti-Hermitian (lossless) wave equations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, and time-independent media. This framework encompasses a broad class of wave equations, including the acoustic wave equation, Maxwell$'$s equations and the elastic wave equation. Our formulation is compatible with standard numerical discretization schemes and allows for the efficient implementation of multiple practically relevant time- and space-dependent sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subspace energies can be extracted and wave fields compared through an $l_2$ loss function, achieving optimal precision scaling with the number of samples taken. Additionally, we introduce techniques for incorporating boundary conditions and linear constraints that preserve the anti-Hermitian nature of the equations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, our framework achieves a quartic speed-up over classical solvers in 3D simulations, under conditions of sufficiently global measurements and compactly supported sources and initial conditions. This quartic speed-up is optimal for time-domain solutions, as the Hamiltonian of the discretized wave equations has local couplings. In summary, our framework provides a versatile approach for simulating wave equations on quantum computers, offering substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art classical methods.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Torque on an Inhomogeneous Chiral Body out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will experience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an object emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first order, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No force arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary (reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to the torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an inhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small quantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is provided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration will essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous chiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the realm of observability.</description>

      <title>Measured Hockey-Stick Divergence and its Applications to Quantum Pufferfish Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing several statistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantum data. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to perform all possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typically limitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end, here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence under several classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove several of its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it is efficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes of measurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states. Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizes optimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. With this connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods to quantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly, we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore its applications in ensuring privacy for channels.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum magnetometry with a laser-written integrated photonic diamond chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can act as a precise quantum sensor even under ambient conditions. In particular, to optimize thier sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system, without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a high-quality buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with a 4.5 ppm density of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 pT$.$Hz $^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 pT$.$Hz $^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for microscale sensing with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Hardness of Quantum One-Wayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output: respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators, the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators. This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c \log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit commitments.</description>

      <title>Permanent oscillations and solitary wave behavior in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on the emergence of thermodynamics in closed quantum systems under unitary time evolution arrived at the consensus that generic systems equilibrate under rather general assumptions. A new focus of the field is thus on exceptions. Persistent oscillations are one possible hallmark of non-ergodic time evolution. While time-crystalline behavior results from, e.g., many-body localization, here we show that ever-revolving solitary waves emerge in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems. This phenomenon is rather general for a variety of frustrated spin systems in one, two, and three dimensions as well as for Hubbard systems.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges, $e$, controlled with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-8}$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never demonstrated such an accuracy for a net flow. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty in the milliampere range, but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections. Here, we present a new programmable quantum current generator, which combines both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier in a quantum electrical circuit enabling the current scaling without errors. Thanks to a full quantum instrumentation, we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated currents, in the microampere range, at quantized values, $\pm(n/p)ef_\mathrm{J}$, with relative uncertainties less than $10^{-8}$, where $n$ and $p$ are integer control parameters and $f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency. This experiment sets the basis of a universal quantum realization of the electrical units, for example able of improving high-value resistance measurements and bridging the gap with other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity in open quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs) through counterdiabatic driving in quantum critical systems in the presence of dissipation. We evaluate unitary as well as nonunitary controls, such that the system density matrix follows a prescribed trajectory corresponding to the eigenstates of a time-dependent reference Hamiltonian at any instant of time. The strength of the dissipator control term for the low-energy states shows universal scaling close to criticality. Using the example of free-fermionic systems, in particular, the transverse-field Ising model, we show that in contrast to STAs in closed quantum critical systems, here, STAs may require multibody interactions terms, even away from criticality, owing to the change in entropy of the time-dependent target state. Further, the associated heat current shows an extremum, while power dissipation changes curvature, close to criticality, and analogous to unitary control, no operational cost is associated with implementation of the exact counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. We believe the counterdiabatic protocol studied here could be of fundamental importance for understanding STAs in many-body open quantum systems and could be highly relevant for varied topics involving open many-body quantum systems, such as quantum computation and many-body quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Prospects of phase-adaptive cooling of levitated magnetic particles in a hollow-core photonic-crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the phase of one of the counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position, followed by the subsequent updating of the control laser's phase leads to Stokes type of cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>
