      <title>Search for high-frequency gravitational waves via re-analysis of cavity axion data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monochromatic high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) provide a distinctive probe of new physics scenarios, most notably axion clouds around rotating black holes formed via superradiance. We reanalyzed data from the CAPP-12T MC (multi-cell) axion haloscope experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133,051802 (2024)]. The study covers a continuous $2\,$MHz frequency span centered at $5.311\,$GHz. No rescan candidates were found, and we set 90% confidence-level exclusion limits on the gravitational-wave strain, reaching $h_0 \approx 3.9 \times 10^{-21}$ in the most sensitive regions of the sky. Interpreted in the context of black-hole superradiance from axion clouds, the results exclude black holes with mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{-6}\,M_\odot$ within distances of $O(10^{-2})\,$AU from Earth, under benchmark assumptions. This work demonstrates the potential of electromagnetic resonant cavities as novel detectors of monochromatic HFGW and motivates future searches for both long-lived and transient signals.</description>

      <title>MEDIC: a network for monitoring data quality in collider experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.</description>

      <title>GPS-Synchronized Monitoring of Supernova Bursts in PandaX-4T: Enabling a Neutrino Trigger for Multi-Messenger Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landmark detection of neutrinos from SN 1987A marked the dawn of a new era in astrophysics, unequivocally establishing them as indispensable probes for investigating stellar evolution and supernova dynamics. Today, supernova burst neutrinos can be observed through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in tonne-scale liquid xenon detectors designed for direct dark matter detection. Capitalizing on this capability, we have developed and deployed a real-time supernova monitoring system for the PandaX-4T experiment. This system incorporates a GPS module providing millisecond-level timing precision, achieves a low false-alarm rate, and maintains high sensitivity to galactic supernova events. This robust methodology is directly scalable and slated for implementation in the next-generation PandaX-20T experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing low energy reconstruction and classification in KM3NeT/ORCA with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.</description>

      <title>WavePID: Studies of DOM-level waveform timing for track vs. cascade discrimination in IceCube at 5-100 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. Its densely instrumented sub-array and dedicated low-energy analyses provide sensitivity to neutrinos in the 5-100 GeV range, enabling precision studies of neutrino oscillations and searches for new physics. This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) are particles that are stable or that live long enough for their decays to be experimentally distinguishable in time or position from their production point. We provide an overview of the phenomenology and experimental signatures of LLPs, focusing on LLPs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We explain what determines a particle's lifetime and we show that LLPs are ubiquitous both within the Standard Model and beyond. We survey the methods used to experimentally detect and characterize particles at collider-based experiments, and discuss how searches for LLPs present both experimental challenges and exciting new possibilities for detection. Finally, we situate LHC searches for LLPs within the broader experimental landscape with a brief overview of searches for LLPs at lower-energy experiments and a discussion of astrophysical and cosmological probes offering complementary insight into the physics of LLPs beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the Cosmic Neutrino Background using matter interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how the Cosmic Neutrino Background can affect the measured phase difference in a matter interferometer. This phase is proportional to a difference in potential energies along the two interferometer paths. The relevant potentials here are the well-known neutrino matter potential and a potential related to the Stodolsky effect. We show how they can be rewritten in terms of scalar potentials, pseudo magnetic fields and spin-spin interactions. Unfortunately, current technology is unlikely to detect this effect and we discuss prospects for the future. We also briefly comment on fermionic Dark Matter which can give rise to very similar effects which can easily be larger than the neutrino case.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-violating Higgs-Gauge couplings with Higgsstrahlung at $e^-e^+$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of a future high-luminosity $e^-e^+$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s}=250~\text{GeV}$ to CP-violating and CP-conserving anomalous $hVV$ interactions via the Higgsstrahlung process. The effects of new physics are parameterized in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory~(SMEFT) framework through six dimension-6 operators modifying the $hVV$ vertices. Using polarized beams and exploiting polarization and spin correlation asymmetries reconstructed from Higgs decay products, we perform a comprehensive analysis across the three dominant decay modes, $h\to b\bar{b}$, $WW^\star$, and $ZZ^\star$. The $h\to WW^\star$ channel exhibits the highest sensitivity to $\mathcal{O}_{HW}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{W}}$, while the $b\bar{b}$ mode constrains the remaining operators with high statistical precision. Sensitivity studies incorporating luminosity scaling and systematic uncertainties show that the projected bounds improve significantly with increasing integrated luminosity, but saturate once experimental systematics exceed the few-percent level. These results highlight the crucial role of spin-based observables and beam polarization in achieving sub-percent precision on SMEFT coefficients at future lepton colliders.</description>

Abstract: The off-axis magnetic near detector of the T2K experiment has undergone a significant upgrade, including the construction and installation of two new Time Projection Chambers featuring innovative resistive Micromegas technology and a field cage composed of thin composite walls. This paper provides a detailed description of the new components of the chambers, including the gas system, gas monitoring chambers, and data acquisition system. Additionally, it reports the results of extensive testing using both neutrino beams and cosmic rays, with comparisons between data and Monte Carlo simulations. The new detectors achieve improved spatial resolution and enhanced particle identification capabilities which are crucial for the precision goals of the T2K experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.</description>

      <title>Higgs Production Classifier using Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable determination of the Higgs production mechanism in hadron collider experiments is essential in the program of the measurements of the Higgs couplings. We employ weak supervision, CWoLa in particular, to train deep neural networks using real data of the diphoton events, in the hope of reducing biases resulting from Monte Carlo simulations. Models based on the convolutional neural network and the transformer are tested and compared. In particular, the classification performance gets slightly better when the photon information is removed from training on the low-luminosity region of $H \to \gamma \gamma$. We explicitly show that the performance can be improved when the training dataset is enlarged by data augmentation using physics-motivated methods. We further demonstrate that the trained model can be successfully applied to the $H \to ZZ$ and $H \to Z\gamma$ events, showing that such classifiers are agnostic to Higgs decay modes provided they do not involve strong QCD corrections.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule predictions on gluonic tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{+-},0^{--}$ and $1^{\pm \pm}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the mass spectrum for tetraquark hybrid states, focusing on the $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ color configuration, within the framework of QCD sum rules. As an extension of our previous work on $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ states, we now construct 18 distinct interpolating currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$, $0^{--}$, and $1^{\pm\pm}$. Using operator product expansion (OPE) techniques and including nonperturbative contributions up to dimension six, we obtain key results: for the $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$ states, the predicted masses lie in the range of $7.2-7.3$ GeV, while the $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$ states have slightly lower masses, between 6.9 and 7.1 GeV. These predictions provide strong support for the possible existence of an $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ component within the di-$J/\psi$ structure reported by LHCb. Moreover, our analogous calculations for tetrabottom hybrid states yield mass ranges of $19.4-19.5$ GeV (for $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$) and $19.2-19.3$ GeV (for $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$), offering crucial references for future searches.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquark production in forward rapidity $pp$ collisions at LHC and FCC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of a fully charmed tetraquark state $T_{4c}$ in $pp$ collisions at forward rapidities through the fragmentation mechanism considering the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism and the solution of the running coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and the impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is estimated. Predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the $T_{4c}$ state are presented assuming different rapidities, distinct quantum numbers of the state and center-of-mass energies. Our results indicate that the higher cross-section is associated with the production of a tensor state $T_{4c}(2^{++})$, which is dominated by the gluon-initiated process. In contrast, the production of the axial-vector state $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ is dominated by the charm-initiated process and is very sensitive to the presence (or not) of an intrinsic charm.</description>

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment based in the USA and composed of a Near Detector (ND) complex at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), and a Far Detector (FD) complex located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) $\sim$1300\,km distant. DUNE will study neutrino oscillations looking for unresolved issues of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) such as CP violation in the leptonic sector, neutrino mass ordering and others, starting from the early 2030s. The FD, with a mass of $\sim$17\,kt, that will exploit both ionization and scintillation signals to detect neutrino interactions with Argon. Scintillating photons in LAr will be detected by the photon detection system (PDS) based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During a test campaign, different laboratories of the collaboration performed an investigation of the best SiPM candidates that fulfill the DUNE FD requirements. We identified two models of SiPM, produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), respectively. In this paper, we focus on the FBK selected model showing its main features. We will describe the characterization protocol, the results at both room and cryogenic temperatures and the photon detection efficiency measurements.</description>

      <title>Traces of the $X(3960)$ state in the femtoscopic $D_s^+ D_s^- $ correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The femtoscopic $ D_s^+D_s^-$ correlations are investigated to predict the signature of the not-yet-established $X(3960)$ state reported by the LHCb Collaboration, in three scenarios: resonant, virtual, or bound. In the last two scenarios, it might also be identified as the state $X(3930)$. The formalism employed to generate this structure dynamically is based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a general $S$-wave potential. We investigate how the relevant properties and observables characterizing this state--such as the pole position, scattering length, and effective range--might be affected by variations in the model parameters. The amplitudes encoding the distinct interpretations of the $X(3960)$ state are then used as input to calculate the femtoscopic correlation function of the $D_s^+ D_s^- $ pair, which is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($\chi$), a doublet fermion ($\Psi$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($\phi_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $\phi_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_\mu$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.</description>

Abstract: We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $\theta_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3\sigma$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.</description>

      <title>Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can acquire "refractive masses" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Search for a cH signal in the associated production of at least one charm quark with a Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first search for a cH signal sensitive to the coupling of the charm quark (c) to the Higgs boson (H) in the associated production of at least one charm quark with a Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The results are based on a data set of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Assuming the standard model (SM) rates for all other Higgs boson production processes, the observed (expected) upper limit at 95% confidence level on the cH signal strength is 243 (355) times the SM prediction. Under the same assumption, the observed (expected) allowed interval on the Higgs boson to charm quark coupling modifier, $\kappa_\mathrm{c}$, is $\lvert \kappa_\mathrm{c} \rvert$ $\lt$ 38.1 ($\lvert \kappa_\mathrm{c} \rvert$ $\lt$ 72.5) at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Search for an eV-scale sterile neutrino with the first six detection units of KM3NeT/ORCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of an eV-scale sterile neutrino has been proposed to explain several anomalous experimental results obtained over the course of the past 25 years. The first search for such a sterile neutrino conducted with data from KM3NeT/ORCA -- a water Cherenkov neutrino telescope under construction at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea -- is reported in this paper. GeV-scale atmospheric neutrino oscillations are measured by reconstructing the energy and arrival direction of up-going neutrinos that have traversed the Earth. This study is based on a data sample containing 5828 neutrino candidates collected with 6 detection units ($5\%$ of the complete detector), corresponding to an exposure of 433 kton-years. From the expected effect of an eV-scale sterile neutrino on the first $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$ standard oscillation maximum, simultaneous constraints are put on the magnitude of the $U_{\mu 4}$ and $U_{\tau 4}$ mixing elements assuming $\Delta m^2_{41} \geq 1$ eV$^2$. The results are compatible with the absence of mixing between active neutrinos and a sterile state, with $|U_{\mu 4}|^2 &lt; 0.138$ and $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 &lt; 0.076$ at a $90\%$ confidence level. Such constraints are compatible with the results reported by other long-baseline experiments, and indicate that with KM3NeT/ORCA it is possible to bring crucial contributions to sterile neutrino searches in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Search for Higgsinos in final states with low-momentum lepton-track pairs at 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for the pair production of Higgsinos in final states with large missing transverse momentum and either two reconstructed muons or a reconstructed lepton (muon or electron) and an isolated track. The analyzed data correspond to proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 137 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The signal scenario assumes two neutralino states, $\widetilde{\chi}^0_2$ and $\widetilde{\chi}^0_1$, with a small mass difference in the range 1$-$10 GeV and a chargino $\widetilde{\chi}^\pm_1$ with an intermediate mass. The analysis focuses on the decay of the heavier neutralino into the lighter one and a virtual Z boson, which decays into two same-flavor leptons. The leptons have small transverse momentum and/or a small opening angle between the identified muons. An isolated track is used to recover events in which only one of the two leptons is identified. Multivariate discriminants are used to enhance the sensitivity by efficiently rejecting backgrounds from SM processes or misreconstructed tracks and/or leptons. The search explores a unique phase space and probes a previously unexplored region of the signal model parameter space. Mass differences between the two neutralinos are probed down to 1.5 GeV, assuming a Higgsino mass of 100 GeV. The maximum excluded Higgsino mass is 115 GeV.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery strategy for standard model effective field theory searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel strategy to uncover indirect signs of new physics in collider data using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, offering notably improved sensitivity compared to traditional global analyses. Our approach leverages genetic algorithms to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional space of operator subsets, identifying deformations that improve agreement with data without relying on prior UV assumptions. This enables the systematic detection of SMEFT scenarios that outperform the Standard Model in explaining observed deviations. We validate the approach on current LHC and LEP measurements, perform closure tests with injected UV signals, and assess performance under high-luminosity projections. The algorithm successfully recovers relevant operator subsets and highlights directions in parameter space where deviations are most likely to emerge. Our results demonstrate the potential of SMEFT-based discovery searches driven by model selection, providing a scalable framework for future data analyses.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of Higgs-Gauge Boson couplings at the future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proposed $e^+e^-$ collider offers an ideal environment for precise estimation of Higgs boson properties which are of utmost importance to validate the Standard Model of particle physics. We investigate $hVV$ couplings, where $V\in \{Z,\gamma\}$ with single Higgs production associated with $Z$ boson at the proposed $e^+e^-$ machine with $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV, within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We employ the recoil mass of the dilepton system, to select the signal phase space, i.e, $Zh \to l^+l^-b\Bar{b}$ events. The constraints on the Wilson coefficients (WCs) are obtained using the optimal observable technique (OOT). On comparison with the current experimental limits at $68\%$ CL with $138$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity, our limits are tighter by a factor ranging from $1.5-10$ for CP even operators, while CP-odd WCs shows comparable limits.</description>

      <title>Discovering the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ in $B$ semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5 aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some features of the CUDACPP software which had not yet been documented, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlation" is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the first full-size production for ePIC TOF layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time (500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&amp;D program at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $\Omega_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>

      <title>Modified Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing confronted by JUNO $\theta_{12}$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The JUNO collaboration has released its first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations results, obtaining $\sin^2\theta_{12} = 0.3092\pm 0.0087$, an improvement in precision by a factor of 1.6 over previous combined results. We confront the minimally modified tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern is one of the most popular simple mixing scheme for neutrinos. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. Minimal modifications preserving one column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, yielding three patterns: a) unchanged third, b) unchanged second and c) unchanged first column. Pattern a) is excluded since it keeps $\theta_{13}=0$. Pattern b) predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ and specific CP phase correlations, but JUNO's smaller $|V_{e2}|$ disfavors it at more than 3.5$\sigma$. Pattern c), predicting $V_{e2} = \cos\tau/\sqrt{3}$, can be in agreement with current data within 1$\sigma$, and implies $\sin^2\theta_{12} = (1-3\sin^2\theta_{13})/3(1-\sin^2\theta_{13})$ and CP violating quantity $\sin \theta = \pm 0.998$. The negative sign favors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Upcoming experiments can further test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed SiPM Readout of Plastic Scintillating Fiber Detector for Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact and high-resolution solution. However, constructing a large-area SciFi detector demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, we present a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm, enabling up to $N_{\textrm{SiPM}}^{\textrm{max}}=C^{2}_{N_{\textrm{ele}}}$ SiPM channels to be read out using only ${N_{\textrm{ele}}}$ electronic channels. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the choice of appropriate diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. A multiplexed SciFi detector module comprising 21 SiPM channels read out through 7 electronic channels are constructed. Electronic tests show that this module exhibits low crosstalk between electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range from $\sim$10 to 122 photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further show that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to the direct (per SiPM channel) readout. These results verify that the proposed method provides a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.</description>
