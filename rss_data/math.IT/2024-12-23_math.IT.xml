      <title>Capacity and PAPR Analysis for MIMO Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling with High Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is a non-orthogonal transmission technique offering a promising solution for future generations of communications. This paper studies the capacity of FTN signaling in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for high acceleration factors. In our previous study [1], we found the capacity for MIMO FTN channels if the acceleration factor is larger than a certain threshold, which depends on the bandwidth of the pulse shape used. In this paper, we extend the capacity analysis to acceleration factors smaller than this mentioned threshold. In addition to capacity, we conduct peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) analysis and simulation for MIMO FTN for varying acceleration factors for both Gaussian and QPSK symbol sets. Our analysis reveals important insights about transmission power and received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation in FTN. As the acceleration factor approaches 0, if the transmission power is fixed, the received SNR diminishes, or if the received SNR is fixed, PAPR at the transmitter explodes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ group rings and automorphism groups of binary linear codes to construct new record-breaking binary linear codes. We consider the semidirect product of abelian groups and cyclic groups and use these groups to construct linear codes. Finally, we obtain some linear codes which have better parameters than the code in \cite{bib5}. All the calculation results and corresponding data are listed in the paper or posted online.</description>

      <title>Microservices-Based Framework for Predictive Analytics and Real-time Performance Enhancement in Travel Reservation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a framework of microservices-based architecture dedicated to enhancing the performance of real-time travel reservation systems using the power of predictive analytics. Traditional monolithic systems are bad at scaling and performing with high loads, causing backup resources to be underutilized along with delays. To overcome the above-stated problems, we adopt a modularization approach in decoupling system components into independent services that can grow or shrink according to demand. Our framework also includes real-time predictive analytics, through machine learning models, that optimize forecasting customer demand, dynamic pricing, as well as system performance. With an experimental evaluation applying the approach, we could show that the framework impacts metrics of performance such as response time, throughput, transaction rate of success, and prediction accuracy compared to their conventional counterparts. Not only does the microservices approach improve scalability and fault tolerance like a usual architecture, but it also brings along timely and accurate predictions, which imply a greater customer satisfaction and efficiency of operation. The integration of real-time analytics would lead to more intelligent decision-making, thereby improving the response of the system along with the reliability it holds. A scalable, efficient framework is offered by such a system to address the modern challenges imposed by any form of travel reservation system while considering other complex, data-driven industries as future applications. Future work will be an investigation of advanced AI models and edge processing to further improve the performance and robustness of the systems employed.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Text Compression Approach Using Transformer-based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text compression shrinks textual data while keeping crucial information, eradicating constraints on storage, bandwidth, and computational efficacy. The integration of lossless compression techniques with transformer-based text decompression has received negligible attention, despite the increasing volume of English text data in communication. The primary barrier in advancing text compression and restoration involves optimizing transformer-based approaches with efficient pre-processing and integrating lossless compression algorithms, that remained unresolved in the prior attempts. Here, we propose a transformer-based method named RejuvenateForme for text decompression, addressing prior issues by harnessing a new pre-processing technique and a lossless compression method. Our meticulous pre-processing technique incorporating the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm achieves compression ratios of 12.57, 13.38, and 11.42 on the BookCorpus, EN-DE, and EN-FR corpora, thus showing state-of-the-art compression ratios compared to other deep learning and traditional approaches. Furthermore, the RejuvenateForme achieves a BLEU score of 27.31, 25.78, and 50.45 on the EN-DE, EN-FR, and BookCorpus corpora, showcasing its comprehensive efficacy. In contrast, the pre-trained T5-Small exhibits better performance over prior state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Moment-optimal finitary isomorphism for i.i.d. processes of equal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finitary isomorphism theorem, due to Keane and Smorodinsky, raised the natural question of how "finite" the isomorphism can be, in terms of moments of the coding radius. More precisely, for which values does there exist an isomorphism between any two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments? [3, 4]. Parry [13] and Krieger [10] showed that those finite moments must be lesser than 1 in general, and Harvey and Peres [5] showed that they must be lesser than 1/2 in general. However, the question for the range between 0 and 1/2 remained open, and in fact no general construction of an isomorphism was shown to exhibit any non trivial finite moments. In the present work we settle this problem, showing that between any two aperiodic Markov processes (and i.i.d. processes in particular) of the same entropy, there exists an isomorphism f with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments for all t in (0,1/2). The isomorphism is constructed explicitly, and the tails of the radii are shown to be optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Variance of the sum of independent quantum computing errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sum of quantum computing errors is the key element both for the estimation and control of errors in quantum computing and for its statistical study. In this article we analyze the sum of two independent quantum computing errors, $X_1$ and $X_2$, and we obtain the formula of the variance of the sum of these errors: $$ V(X_1+X_2)=V(X_1)+V(X_2)-\frac{V(X_1)V(X_2)}{2}. $$ We conjecture that this result holds true for general quantum computing errors and we prove the formula for independent isotropic quantum computing errors.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Belief Propagation Decoder for LDPC Codes with Small Variable Node Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient data processing by imitating the event-based behavior of biological neurons. In previous work, we introduced the enlarge-likelihood-each-notable-amplitude spiking-neural-network (ELENA-SNN) decoder, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The decoder integrates SNNs into belief propagation (BP) decoding by approximating the check node (CN) update equation using SNNs. However, when decoding LDPC codes with a small variable node(VN) degree, the approximation gets too rough, and the ELENA-SNN decoder does not yield good results. This paper introduces the multi-level ELENA-SNN (ML-ELENA-SNN) decoder, which is an extension of the ELENA-SNN decoder. Instead of a single SNN approximating the CN update, multiple SNNs are applied in parallel, resulting in a higher resolution and higher dynamic range of the exchanged messages. We show that the ML-ELENA-SNN decoder performs similarly to the ubiquitous normalized min-sum decoder for the (38400, 30720) regular LDPC code with a VN degree of dv = 3 and a CN degree of dc = 15.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Beyond Diagonal RIS: A Universal Framework Applicable to Arbitrary Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems due to their ability to control the propagation environment in a hardware- and energy-efficient way. Recently, the concept of RISs has been extended to beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), which unlock the full potential of RISs thanks to the presence of tunable interconnections between RIS elements. While various algorithms have been proposed for specific BD-RIS architectures, a universal optimization framework applicable to arbitrary architectures is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this research gap by proposing an architecture-independent framework for BD-RIS optimization, with the main focus on sum-rate maximization and transmit power minimization in multiuser multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first incorporate BD-RIS architectures into the models by connecting the scattering matrix with the admittance matrix and introducing appropriate constraints to the admittance matrix. The formulated problems are then solved by our custom-designed partially proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (pp-ADMM) algorithms. The pp-ADMM algorithms are computationally efficient, with each subproblem either admitting a closed-form solution or being easily solvable. We further explore the extension of the proposed framework to general utility functions and multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve a better trade-off between performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. We also compare the performance of various BD-RIS architectures in MU-MISO systems using the proposed approach, which has not been explored before due to the lack of an architecture-independent framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient List-decoding of Polynomial Ideal Codes with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [BGM23, GZ23, AGL23], it was shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes are list decodable with optimal list size with high probability, i.e., they attain the Singleton bound for list decoding [ST20, Rot22, GST22]. We extend this result to the family of polynomial ideal codes, a large class of error-correcting codes which includes several well-studied families of codes such as Reed-Solomon, folded Reed-Solomon, and multiplicity codes. More specifically, similarly to the Reed-Solomon setting, we show that randomly punctured polynomial ideal codes over an exponentially large alphabet exactly achieve the Singleton bound for list-decoding; while such codes over a polynomially large alphabet approximately achieve it.
  Combining our results with the efficient list-decoding algorithm for a large subclass of polynomial ideal codes of [BHKS21], implies as a corollary that a large subclass of polynomial ideal codes (over random evaluation points) is efficiently list decodable with optimal list size. To the best of our knowledge, this gives the first family of codes that can be efficiently list decoded with optimal list size (for all list sizes), as well as the first family of linear codes of rate $R$ that can be efficiently list decoded up to a radius of $1 -R-\epsilon$ with list size that is polynomial (and even linear) in $1/\epsilon$. Our result applies to natural families of codes with algebraic structure such as folded Reed-Solomon or multiplicity codes (over random evaluation points).
  Our proof follows the general framework of [BGM23, GZ23, AGL23], but several new ingredients are needed. The main two new ingredients are a polynomial-ideal GM-MDS theorem (extending the algebraic GM-MDS theorem of [YH19, Lov21]), as well as a duality theorem for polynomial ideal codes, both of which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the principles of information theory, measure theory, and theoretical computer science, we introduce a signal deconvolution method with a wide range of applications to coding theory, particularly in zero-knowledge one-way communication channels, such as in deciphering messages (i.e., objects embedded into multidimensional spaces) from unknown generating sources about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our multidimensional space reconstruction method from an arbitrary received signal is proven to be agnostic vis-\`a-vis the encoding-decoding scheme, computation model, programming language, formal theory, the computable (or semi-computable) method of approximation to algorithmic complexity, and any arbitrarily chosen (computable) probability measure. The method derives from the principles of an approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capable of building a general-purpose model of models independent of any arbitrarily assumed prior probability distribution. We argue that this optimal and universal method of decoding non-random data has applications to signal processing, causal deconvolution, topological and geometric properties encoding, cryptography, and bio- and technosignature detection.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique for high-mobility communications based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning two parameters in the DAFT module, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely circumvent path overlap, thereby constituting a full representation of delay-Doppler profile. However, AFDM has a crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), stemming from randomness of modulated symbols. To reduce the PAPR of AFDM, a novel algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed in this letter. The GPS varying the pre-chirp parameter across subcarrier groups in a non-enumerated manner and then selects the signal with the smallest PAPR among all candidate signals. We detail the operational procedures of the GPS algorithm, analyzing GPS from four aspects: PAPR performance, computational complexity, spectral efficiency, and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS in reducing PAPR. At the cost of slight communication performance, AFDM with GPS can achieve better PAPR performance than orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) while maintaining a lower modulation complexity.</description>

Abstract: Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD) is a recently proposed soft-input forward error correction decoder for arbitrary binary linear codes. Inspired by recent proposals that leverage binary linear codebook structure to reduce the number of queries made by Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND), for binary linear codes that include a full-message single parity-check (SPC) bit, we show that it is possible to reduce the number of queries made by GCD by a factor of up to 2 with the greatest guesswork reduction realized at lower SNRs, without impacting decoding precision. Codes without a full-message SPC can be modified to include one by changing a column of the generator matrix to obtain a decoding complexity advantage, and we demonstrate that this can often be done without losing decoding precision. To practically avail of the complexity advantage, a noise effect pattern generator capable of producing sequences for given Hamming weights, such as the landslide algorithm developed for ORBGRAND, is necessary.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantages in (n,d)-&gt;1 Random Access Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Accurate Self-Attention Attribution for Message Passing Neural Networks via the Computation Tree Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in various popular message passing neural networks (MPNNs), enabling the model to adaptively control the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. Such attention-based MPNNs (Att-GNNs) have also been used as a baseline for multiple studies on explainable AI (XAI) since attention has steadily been seen as natural model interpretations, while being a viewpoint that has already been popularized in other domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, undermining the potential of attention as interpretations for Att-GNNs. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of Att-GNNs and their potential explainability via attention. To this end, we propose GATT, edge attribution calculation method for self-attention MPNNs based on the computation tree, a rooted tree that reflects the computation process of the underlying model. Despite its simplicity, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GATT in three aspects of model explanation: faithfulness, explanation accuracy, and case studies by using both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. In all cases, the results demonstrate that GATT greatly improves edge attribution scores, especially compared to the previous naive approach.

      <title>Modified Baum-Welch Algorithm for Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Turbo Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind estimation of intersymbol interference channels based on the Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm, a specific implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for training hidden Markov models, is robust and does not require labeled data. However, it is known for its extensive computation cost, slow convergence, and frequently converges to a local maximum. In this paper, we modified the trellis structure of the BW algorithm by associating the channel parameters with two consecutive states. This modification enables us to reduce the number of required states by half while maintaining the same performance. Moreover, to improve the convergence rate and the estimation performance, we construct a joint turbo-BW-equalization system by exploiting the extrinsic information produced by the turbo decoder to refine the BW-based estimator at each EM iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that the joint system achieves convergence in 10 EM iterations, which is 8 iterations less than a separate system design for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 4dB. Additionally, the joint system provides improved estimation accuracy with a mean square error (MSE) of $10^{-4}$ for an SNR of 6dB. We also identify scenarios where a joint design is not preferable, especially when the channel is noisy (e.g., SNR=2dB) and the decoder cannot provide reliable extrinsic information for a BW-based estimator.</description>
