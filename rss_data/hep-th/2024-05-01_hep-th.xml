      <title>Building the Blocks of Schwarzschild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild black hole can be ``resolved'' into bound states of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in four dimensions. These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies. These solutions pave the way for analogous constructions in supergravity and for a brane/anti-brane description of the Schwarzschild black hole in string theory.</description>

      <title>Flux vacua in type IIB compactifications on orbifolds: their finiteness and minimal string coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of (supersymmetric) moduli stabilisation in type IIB toroidal orientifolds with fluxes. We provide strong evidence towards the finiteness of the number of inequivalent vacua for a given total 3-form flux charge $N_{\rm flux}$. We also find that the minimal value of the string coupling $g_s$ is given in terms of $N_{\rm flux}$ and present strong evidence for the asymptotic relation $g_{s,\,\rm{min}}\sim c/N_{\rm flux}^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1,2$, valid for not too small $N_{\rm flux}$, where $c$ is an order 1 coefficient and $\alpha$ depends on the orbifold. Imposing tadpole cancellation, $N_{\rm flux}$ is bounded from the number of orientifold O3-planes. Combined with the flux quantisation, this reduces considerably the allowed vacua while the lower bound of the string coupling is then not far from unity. On the other hand, the presence of negative D3-brane charge induced by magnetised D7-branes breaks supersymmetry and relaxes the bound, allowing significantly smaller values for $g_s$.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets and their hypermultiplet couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an off-shell $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal cubic vertex for the hypermultiplet coupled to an arbitrary integer higher spin ${\bf s}$ gauge $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplet % in flatfour-dimensional space. in a general $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity background. We heavily use $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ harmonic superspace that provides an unconstrained superfield Lagrangian description. We start with $\mathcal{N}=2$ global superconformal symmetry transformations of the free hypermultiplet model and require invariance of the cubic vertices of general form under these transformations and their gauged version. As a result, we deduce $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ unconstrained analytic superconformal gauge potentials for an arbitrary integer ${\bf s}$. These are the basic ingredients of the approach under consideration. We describe the properties of the gauge potentials, derive the corresponding superconformal and gauge transformation laws, and inspect the off-shell contents of the thus obtained $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin ${\bf s}$ multiplets in the Wess-Zumino gauges. The spin ${\bf s}$ multiplet involves $8(2{\bf s} -1)_B + 8(2{\bf s}-1)_F$ essential off-shell degrees of freedom. The cubic vertex has the generic structure higher spin gauge superfields $\times$ hypermultiplet supercurrents. We present the explicit form of the relevant supercurrents.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Novel Insights in Quantum Dynamics through Extended Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in the study of the model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK), as elucidated in a recent paper, we embark on a re-evaluation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Our motivation stems from the insights gained from the DSSYK model, particularly its ability to capture essential features of quantum dynamics and gravitational effects. In this work, we delve into the SYK model, uncovering precise solutions for the two-point function and self-energy that have not been previously reported. Building upon the advancements made in particle physics phenomenology, we extend the SYK model to encompass tensor field theory. Through the incorporation of a cutoff term to ensure convergence, we substantially advance our understanding of quantum many-body physics. Our investigation extends to experimental parameter estimation and the exploration of cutoff dependency in random couplings, providing invaluable insights into system dynamics. The introduction of a novel tensor field theory replaces conventional fermionic degrees of freedom with tensorial counterparts, leading to the discovery of intriguing phase transition phenomena characterized by a first-order transition. Furthermore, we elucidate a direct linear relationship between the coupling parameter and the cutoff scale. These findings not only shed light on emergent behavior across both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems but also pave the way for further theoretical and experimental exploration, inspired by the recent advancements in the SYK model.</description>

      <title>$N=(2,2)$ superfields and geometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one)in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study space-time filling unstable D-brane coupled to gravity. We find Hamiltonian for this D-brane and then we implement Brown-Kuchar formalism for this system. We calculate algebra of constraints of deparametrized theory and we show that for large $T$ the Poisson brackets between new constraints are zero. Then we define gauge invariant functions on phase space following deparametrization construction introduced in [9].</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conserved charges and 2-kink collision in quasi-integrable potential KdV models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a particular deformation of the potential KdV model (pKdV) and construct the quasi-conservation laws by a direct method. The charge densities, differing from their integrable counterpart with homogeneous degree terms, exhibit mixed scale dimension terms. The modifications of the charges around the soliton interaction regions are examined by numerically simulating some representative anomalies. We show numerically the elastic scattering of two kinks for a wide range of values of the deformation parameters. It is discussed an anomaly cancellation mechanism to define an exact conservation law of the usual pKdV model, and a renormalization procedure is introduced for some divergent charges by subtructing the continuous linear background contribution. The KdV-type equations are quite ubiquitous in several areas of non-linear science, such as the study of General Relativity in $AdS_{3}$, Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductivity and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>How to define the Unruh-DeWitt detector on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum of an accelerating observer is defined on the local inertial frame, which is called a ``moving frame''. However, in the discussion of the Unruh-deWitt detector, many papers define the vacuum on a fixed frame. This paper discusses the Unruh-deWitt detector by defining the vacuum directly on the local inertial frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the exact WKB.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement to confinement by generalizing BRST symmetry on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the theory in the quadratic gauge on 4-sphere, $\mathbb{S}^{4}$ consists of two phases namely, the confined and the deconfined phases. A suitable finite field dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformation interrelates two different gauge fixed theories. In this paper, we use the FFBRST technique on the curved space for the first time and elaborate a novel application of it. We propose two different formulations of this technique that transform the deconfined phase action on sphere to the confined phase action on sphere inside the quadratic gauge. Both proposed passages change the phase with BRST invariance to the phase without BRST invariance unlike usual connections where the FFBRST operation leave the BRST symmetry intact and there is a unique field theoretic essence of them, which makes them particularly important to study. Thus, the two different field redefinitions act as a new mechanism that execute phase transition between two real QCD phases on 4-sphere other than ghost condensation process.</description>

      <title>The strong CP problem revisited and solved by the gauge group topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the non-perturbative result that the $\theta$ angle which defines the vacuum structure is not a $c$-number free parameter, as suggested by the instanton semi-classical approximation, but instead one of the points of the spectrum of the central operator $\tilde{\theta}$ which describes the gauge group topology. Hence, the value of such an angle should not be \textit{a priori} fixed, but rather be determined, as any quantum operator, by the infinite volume limit of the functional integral, where the fermionic mass term uniquely fixes the phase, with $&lt; \tilde{\theta} &gt; = \theta_M$, the mass angle. Such an equality is stable under radiative corrections performed before the infinite volume limit of the functional integral.
  The mechanisms is carefully controlled in the massive Schwinger model with attention to the infrared problems, to the volume effects induced by boundary terms and with a careful discussion of the infinite volume limit of the functional integral. The extension to the QCD case relies on the choice of modified APS boundary conditions which do not break chiral symmetry, allowing for the crucial role of the fermionic mass term in uniquely determining the phase, with a solution of the strong $CP$ problem.</description>

      <title>Trace conservation laws in $T^2/Z_m$ orbifold gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theory compactified on an orbifold is defined by gauge symmetry, matter contents, and boundary conditions. There are equivalence classes (ECs), each of which consists of physically equivalent boundary conditions. We propose the powerful necessary conditions, trace conservation laws (TCLs), which achieve a sufficient classification of ECs in U(N) and SU(N) gauge theories on $T^2/Z_m$ orbifolds $(m=2,3,4,6)$. The TCLs yield the equivalent relations between the diagonal boundary conditions without relying on an explicit form of gauge transformations. The TCLs also show the existence of off-diagonal ECs, which consist only of off-diagonal matrices, on $T^2/Z_4$ and $T^2/Z_6$. After the sufficient classification, the exact numbers of ECs are obtained.</description>

      <title>Toward the application of large-$N$ deconfinement to SU(3) QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally known for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory at finite temperature that phase transitions are manifested by taking the large-$N$ limit. Since the large-$N$ theory undergoes two thermodynamic phase transitions, a nontrivial intermediate phase can be realized in addition to the phases classified as the conventional confined and deconfined phases. In this talk, we discuss that a similar picture can be applied to QCD with $N=3$. In particular, we analyze the gauge configurations of lattice QCD calculations involving dynamical quarks and show the results of an analysis of the deviation due to finite-temperature effects from the Haar randomness expected at zero temperature in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory, using physical pictures suggested by the large-$N$ theory.</description>

      <title>Scale and Conformal Invariance in 2d Sigma Models, with an Application to N=4 Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adapting previously known arguments concerning Ricci flow and the c-theorem, we give a direct proof that in a two-dimensional sigma-model with compact target space, scale invariance implies conformal invariance in perturbation theory. This argument, which applies to a general sigma-model constructed with a target space metric and B-field, is in accord with a more general proof in the literature that applies to arbitrary two-dimensional quantum field theories. Models with extended supersymmetry and a B-field are known to provide interesting test cases for the relation between scale invariance and conformal invariance in sigma-model perturbation theory. We give examples showing that in such models, the obstructions to conformal invariance suggested by general arguments can actually occur in models with target spaces that are not compact or complete. Thus compactness of the target space, or at least a suitable condition of completeness, is necessary as well as sufficient to ensure that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in models of this type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we comment on the path integral formulation of string theory on $\mathcal{M}\times\text{S}^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ where $\mathcal{M}$ is any hyperbolic 3-manifold. In the special case of $k=1$ NS-NS flux, we provide a covariant description of the worldsheet theory and argue that the path integral depends only on the details of the conformal boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}$, making the background independence of this theory manifest. We provide a simple path integral argument that the path integral localizes onto holomorphic covering maps from the worldsheet to the boundary. For closed manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, the gravitational path integral is argued to be trivial. This implies that the bulk gravitational theory has precisely one state in its Hilbert space. Finally, we comment on the effect of continuous deformations of the worldsheet theory which introduce non-minimal string tension.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Tunneling Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tunneling Potential Formalism was introduced to calculate the tunneling actions that control vacuum decay as an alternative to the standard Euclidean Formalism. The new approach sets the problem as a simple variational problem in field space with decay described by a tunneling potential function $V_t$ that extremizes a simple action functional $S[V_t]$ and has a number of appealing properties that have been presented elsewhere. In this note I discuss several instances in which this $V_t$ approach seems to give more than one would have expected a priori, as the following: the $V_t$ describing the decay is a minimum of the new action $S[V_t]$ rather than a saddle point; the decay of AdS, dS or Minkowski vacua are governed by a unique universal $S[V_t]$ which also gives the Hawking-Moss instanton in the appropriate limit; physically relevant solutions beyond the Coleman-De Luccia (CdL) bounce, like pseudo-bounces or bubbles of nothing (BoNs), show up in a straightforward way as generalizations of the CdL bounce, with the correct boundary conditions; in cases for which the Euclidean action calculation requires the inclusion of particular boundary terms (like for BoNs or for the decay of AdS maxima above the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound) $S[V_t]$ gives the correct result without the need of including any boundary term.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in 2D from String Theory: SymTFTs, Intrinsic Relativeness, and Anomalies of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized global symmetries, in particular non-invertible and categorical symmetries, have become a focal point in the recent study of quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we investigate aspects of symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) and anomalies of non-invertible symmetries for 2D QFTs from a string theory perspective. Our primary focus is on an infinite class of 2D QFTs engineered on D1-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularities. We derive 3D SymTFTs from the topological sector of IIB supergravity and discuss the resulting 2D QFTs, which can be intrinsically relative or absolute. For intrinsically relative QFTs, we propose a sufficient condition for them to exist. For absolute QFTs, we show that they exhibit non-invertible symmetries with an elegant brane origin. Furthermore, we find that these non-invertible symmetries can suffer from anomalies, which we discuss from a top-down perspective. Explicit examples are provided, including theories for $Y^{(p,k)}(\mathbb{P}^2)$, $Y^{(2,0)}(\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1)$, and $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_4$ geometries.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Analysis of Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime Within External fields with Aharonov-Bohm interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersymmetric analysis of spinning cosmic string spacetime, involving an electron in magnetic fields, has been conducted. We examined the Dirac system within extended special functions known as exceptional orthogonal polynomials. Corresponding Dirac system is transformed to a relativistic system with a nonlinear isotonic oscillator. Furthermore, new potential models that extend the radial oscillator by adding rational terms are expressed in terms of the exceptional orthogonal Laguerre $X_{m}$ polynomial. The necessary analyses of the potential, energy levels, and probability density graphs are introduced for various cosmic string topological defects and Aharonov-Bohm interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction: I. General framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Hawking showed that natural states for free quantum matter fields on classical spacetimes that solve the spherically symmetric vacuum Einstein equations are KMS states of non-vanishing temperature. Although Hawking's calculation does not include backreaction of matter on geometry, it is more than plausible that the corresponding Hawking radiation leads to black hole evaporation which is in principle observable.
  Obviously, an improvement of Hawking's calculation including backreaction is a problem of quantum gravity. Since no commonly accepted quantum field theory of general relativity is available yet, it has been difficult to reliably derive the backreaction effect. An obvious approach is to use black hole perturbation theory of a Schwarzschild black hole of fixed mass and to quantise those perturbations. But it is not clear how to reconcile perturbation theory with gauge invariance beyond linear perturbations.
  In a recent work we proposed a new approach to this problem that applies when the physical situation has an approximate symmetry, such as homogeneity (cosmology), spherical symmetry (Schwarzschild) or axial symmetry (Kerr). The idea, which is surprisingly feasible, is to first construct the non-perturbative physical (reduced) Hamiltonian of the reduced phase space of fully gauge invariant observables and only then to apply perturbation theory directly in terms of observables. The task to construct observables is then disentangled from perturbation theory, thus allowing to unambiguosly develop perturbation theory to arbitrary orders.
  In this first paper of the the series we outline and showcase this approach for spherical symmetry and second order in the perturbations for Einstein-Klein-Gordon-Maxwell theory. Details and generalisation to other matter and symmetry and higher orders will appear in subsequent companion papers.</description>

Abstract: In this second paper of our series we focus on the classical pure gravity sector of spherically symmetric black hole perturbations and expand the reduced Hamiltonian to second order. To compare our manifestly gauge invariant formalism with established results in the literature we have to translate our results derived in Gullstrand-Painlev\'e gauge to the gauges used in those works. After several canonical transformations we expectedly find exact agreement with the Hamiltonian given by Moncrief which generates the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations of motion for the linear axial (often denoted odd) and polar (often denoted even) perturbations respectively. This confirms the validity of our method which immediately generalises to higher orders.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend reduced phase space approach to black hole perturbation theory to Maxwell matter. We expand the resulting reduced Hamiltonian to second order in the graviton and photon perturbations and find that the corresponding equations of motion match the ones derived in the literature. Accordingly our approach reproduces previous results at second order. Its real virtue lies in the fact that it extends to any order in perturbation theory in a manifestly gauge invariant fashion.</description>

      <title>Topological holography for fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological holography is a conjectured correspondence between the symmetry charges and defects of a $D$-dimensional system with the anyons in a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order: the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). Topological holography is conjectured to capture the topological aspects of symmetry in gapped and gapless systems, with different phases corresponding to different gapped boundaries (anyon condensations) of the SymTFT. This correspondence was previously considered primarily for bosonic systems, excluding many phases of condensed matter systems involving fermionic electrons. In this work, we extend the SymTFT framework to establish a topological holography correspondence for fermionic systems. We demonstrate that this fermionic SymTFT framework captures the known properties of $1+1D$ fermion gapped phases and critical points, including the classification, edge-modes, and stacking rules of fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs), and computation of partition functions of fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs). Beyond merely reproducing known properties, we show that the SymTFT approach can additionally serve as a practical tool for discovering new physics, and use this framework to construct a new example of a fermionic intrinsically gapless SPT phase characterized by an emergent fermionic anomaly.</description>

      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this paper, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free on-site microscopic symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are labeled by a positive integer $Q$ and constructed by a deformation of the 2d classical XY model, defined on any lattice, with an on-site potential that preserves a discrete $Q$-fold spin rotation and reflection symmetry. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of Landau-incompatible transitions are easily seen, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase are obtained, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We present quantum models with anomaly-free symmetries that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

Abstract: Starting from billiard partitions which arose recently in the description of periodic trajectories of ellipsoidal billiards in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we introduce a new type of separable integer partition classes, called type B. We study the numbers of basis partitions with $d$ parts and relate them to the Fibonacci sequence and its natural generalizations. Remarkably, the generating series of basis partitions can be related to the quiver generating series of symmetric quivers corresponding to the framed unknot via knots-quivers correspondence, and to the count of Schr\"oder paths.</description>

Abstract: A scalar field with an exponential potential in FLRW universe admits the exact solution. We uncover the hidden symmetries behind the system by utilising the Eisenhart lift of field theories. We find that a conformal Killing vector field in the field space exists only for a particular combination of exponential functions which includes a single exponential potential. This implies the existence of additional conserved quantity and explains the integrability of the system.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

If the electric charge or magnetic charge is nonzero, we show that nontrivial differentiable time-periodic Majorana fermions do not exist outside the event horizon in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetimes, and between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Small Instanton Effects on Composite Axion Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of small instanton effects on the axion mass in the composite accidental axion (CAA) models. These models are designed to address the axion quality problem, where QCD gauge symmetry is embedded as an unbroken diagonal subgroup of a product gauge group. These models contain small instantons not included in low-energy QCD, which could enhance the axion mass significantly. However, in the CAA models, our analysis reveals that these effects on the axion mass are non-vanishing but are negligible compared to the QCD effects. This highlights the important role of anomalous but non-spontaneously broken U(1) symmetries in restricting the impact of small instantons on the axion mass. Our study provides crucial insights into the dynamics within CAA models and suggests broader implications for understanding small instanton effects in other composite axion models.</description>

Abstract: We discretize Chern-Simons couplings in gauge invariant way. We obtain (p+q)-forms representing Chern-Simons couplings on (p + q)-simplexes from wedge products of p- and q-forms on p- and q-simplexes, respectively, where p- and q-simplexes form (p+q)-simplexes by having a common vertex. We show that the Chern-Simons couplings on simplicial complexes reduce to Chern-Simons couplings on the manifolds in a continuum limit. Moreover, we prove that a typical discretized Chern-Simons term that has the Chern-Simons coupling is gauge invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \cite{DESI:2024mwx} combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of the complete quadratic (in torsion and nonmetricity) metric-affine gravity. Namely, we add to the scalar-curvature gravitational Lagrangian, the 17 independent quadratic (parity-even and parity-odd) torsion and nonmetricity invariants. Sticking to a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and assuming a perfect hyperfluid source, we explore the new effects that torsion and nonmetricity bring into play. It is shown that the inclusion of these invariants offers rich phenomenology. In particular, some well-known examples of exotic matter like cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff matter, etc., emerge quite naturally as manifestations of the fluid's intrinsic structure (hypermomentum). By studying the extended Friedmann equations in the complete quadratic theory and isolating the various parts of the hypermomentum, we find a plethora of solutions with interesting features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model in which the Gauss-Bonnet invariant holds the quintessence at a fixed point, respecting an initial $Z_2$ symmetry in the radiation-dominated era. This results in an early dark energy, which becomes significant around the matter-radiation equality era. However, due to $Z_2$ symmetry breaking, scalarization occurs, leading to a rapid reduction in the early dark energy density. The model then quickly behaves like the $\Lambda$CDM model. This scenario alleviates the Hubble tension and aligns with the assumption that the gravitational wave speed is infinitesimally close to the speed of light.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. How these two contributions are distributed has not been seriously investigated. Meanwhile, a dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields, whose application to cosmology is not straightforward. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral gravitational waves around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that resembles the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis scenario. This approach allows us to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we conjecture that level-crossing does not seem to be efficient while the charge accumulation in the vacuum likely takes place. Phenomenological implication is also discussed in the context of gravitational leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: We show that the geometry of the asymptotic infinities of Minkowski spacetime (in $d+1$ dimensions) is captured by homogeneous spaces of the Poincar\'e group: the blow-ups of spatial (Spi) and timelike (Ti) infinities in the sense of Ashtekar--Hansen and a novel space Ni fibering over $\mathscr{I}$. We embed these spaces \`a la Penrose--Rindler into a pseudo-euclidean space of signature $(d+1,2)$ as orbits of the same Poincar\'e subgroup of O$(d+1,2)$. We describe the corresponding Klein pairs and determine their Poincar\'e-invariant structures: a carrollian structure on Ti, a pseudo-carrollian structure on Spi and a "doubly-carrollian" structure on Ni. We give additional geometric characterisations of these spaces as grassmannians of affine hyperplanes in Minkowski spacetime: Spi is the (double cover of the) grassmannian of affine lorentzian hyperplanes; Ti is the grassmannian of affine spacelike hyperplanes and Ni fibers over the grassmannian of affine null planes, which is $\mathscr{I}$. We exhibit Ni as the fibred product of $\mathscr{I}$ and the lightcone over the celestial sphere. We also show that Ni is the total space of the bundle of scales of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$ and show that the symmetry algebra of its doubly-carrollian structure is isomorphic to the symmetry algebra of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$; that is, the BMS algebra. We show how to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime from any of its asymptotic geometries, by establishing that points in Minkowski spacetime parametrise certain lightcone cuts in the asymptotic geometries. We include an appendix comparing with (A)dS and observe that the de Sitter groups have no homogeneous spaces which could play the r\^ole that the celestial sphere plays in flat space holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss kinematical features of conformal Carroll field theories in three dimensions (3d). Conformal extension of Carroll algebra is infinite dimensional even in 3d unlike its relativistic counterpart, and hence 3d Carroll CFTs share similarities with 2d CFT. We provide a construction for the conserved charges for Carrollian CFTs and an expression for stress tensor OPEs consistent with the algebra of charges. We discuss a free field model where these symmetries are realised and explicitly compute the OPEs verifying our construction. In addition we comment on the possibility of extending the conformal symmetries to diffeomorphisms of spatial slice for these Carrollian theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the arbitrariness of boundary conditions (BCs) on $S^1/Z_2$ brane-world models with the gauge group $U(N)$. The BCs are chosen independently on the branes and the bulk in this model. There are numerous choices for BCs in general, but some of the BCs are connected through gauge transformations. We show that the equivalent relations are obtained on the UV-brane without relying on specific transformation parameters. There is no other equivalent relation on the UV-brane. On the other hand, we find that a gauge transformation with a kink connects all the BCs on the bulk and IR-brane. It means that the arbitrariness of BCs is completely solved on the bulk and the IR-brane except for the UV-brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic classification of scalar field theories whose amplitudes admit a double copy formulation and identify two building blocks at 4-point and 13 at 5-point. Using the 4-point blocks as bootstrap seeds, this naturally leads to a single copy theory that is a gauged NLSM. Moreover, its double copy includes a novel theory that can be written in terms of Lovelock invariants of an induced metric, and includes Dirac-Born-Infeld and the special Galileon in specific limits. The amplitudes of these Goldstone modes have two distinct soft behaviour regimes, corresponding to a hybrid of non-linear symmetries.</description>

      <title>String amplitudes and mutual information in confining backgrounds: the partonic behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13454v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the background of several holographic confining backgrounds, we present the connections between the behaviors of string scattering amplitudes and mutual information. We lay down the analogies between the logarithmic branch cut behavior of the string scattering amplitude in $4d$, $ \mathcal{A}_4 $, at low and medium Mandelstam variable $s$ observed in \cite{Bianchi:2021sug}, which is due to the dependence of the string tension on the holographic coordinate, and the branch cut behavior observed in mutual information and critical distance $D_c$ at low-cut-off variable $u_{KK}$ studied in our previous work \cite{Ghodrati:2021ozc}. It can also be seen that in both cases, as $s$ or $u_{KK}$ increases, the peaks in the branch cuts fade away in the form of $\text{Re}\lbrack \mathcal{A}_4 \rbrack \propto s^{-1}$. Then, we used modular flow and modular Hamiltonian as intermediary concept to further clarify the observed connection. We discussed how mutual information itself can detect chaos in various scenarios. In addition, we considered two examples of Compton scattering between two photons and also the decay of a highly excited string into two tachyons and scrutinized the pattern of entanglement entropy and the change in the mutual information in these examples. Then, the kink-kink and kink-antikink scatterings as simple models of scattering in confining geometries have been used to examine the fractal structures in the scatterings of topological defects. Finally, the relationships between Regge conformal block and quantum error correction codes through pole-skipping and chaos bound have been postulated. These observed connections can further establish the ER$=$EPR conjecture and the general interdependence between the scattering amplitudes and entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constant and Maximum of Entropy for de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are at least two cosmological constants calling for explanation. The first one describes the quasi-de Sitter inflation in the early universe, and the second describes the current acceleration of the universe associated with dark energy. An approach to the computation of the inflationary cosmological constant in the early universe is proposed. The tunneling and no-boundary proposals suggest that the ground state of the early universe is the de Sitter space. In this paper it is argued that the radius of the de Sitter space, i.e. the cosmological constant, can be computed using the principle of maximum entropy. The universe emerges from ``nothing" that corresponds to a minimum of entropy. The entropy reaches its maximal value for the 4-dimensional de Sitter space with the inflationary cosmological constant $\Lambda=3\pi\,\exp\{-\psi(3/2)\}$, where $\psi$ is the digamma function, $\Lambda\approx 9.087$ in Planck units.</description>

Abstract: We construct supersymmetric fermionic Wilson loops along general curves in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and along general planar curves in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal $SU(N)\times SU(N)$ quiver theory. These loops are generalizations of the Zarembo loops and are cohomologically equivalent to them. In $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, we compute their expectation values and verify the cohomological equivalence relation up to the order $g^4$ in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on thermal transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the picture of partial deconfinement developed in recent years for large-$N$ gauge theories, we propose a new way of analyzing and understanding thermal phase transition in QCD. We find nontrivial support for our proposal by analyzing the WHOT-QCD collaboration's lattice configurations for SU(3) QCD in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions with up, down, and strange quarks.
  We find that the Polyakov line (the holonomy matrix around a thermal time circle) is governed by the Haar-random distribution at low temperatures. The deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures can be measured via the character expansion, or equivalently, via the expectation values of the Polyakov loop defined by the various nontrivial representations of SU(3).
  We find that the Polyakov loop corresponding to the fundamental representation and loops in the higher representation condense at different temperatures. This suggests that there are (at least) three phases, one intermediate phase existing in between the completely-confined and the completely-deconfined phases. Our identification of the intermediate phase is supported also by the condensation of instantons: by studying the instanton numbers of the WHOT-QCD configurations, we find that the instanton condensation occurs for temperature regimes corresponding to what we identify as the completely-confined and intermediate phases, whereas the instantons do not condense in the completely-deconfined phase.
  Our characterization of confinement based on the Haar-randomness explains why the Polyakov loop is a good observable to distinguish the confinement and the deconfinement phases in QCD despite the absence of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ center symmetry.</description>

      <title>Axions and Superfluidity in Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective field theory (EFT) for dynamical axions in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) is presented. A pseudoscalar axion excitation is predicted in WSMs at sufficiently low temperatures, independently of the strength of the Weyl fermion self-coupling. For strong fermion self-coupling the axion is the gapless Goldstone boson of chiral $U(1)^{\text{ch}}$ spontaneous symmetry breaking. For weak fermion self-coupling an axion is also generated at non-zero chiral density for Weyl nodes displaced in energy, as a gapless collective mode of correlated fermion pair excitations of the Fermi surface. This is an explicit example of the extension of Goldstone's theorem to symmetry breaking by the axial anomaly itself. In both cases the axion is a chiral density wave or phason mode of the superfluid state of the WSM, and the Weyl fermions form a chiral condensate $\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ at low temperatures. In the presence of an applied magnetic field the axion mode becomes gapped, in analogy to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in a superconductor. 't Hooft anomaly matching from ultraviolet to infrared scales is directly verified in the EFT approach. WSMs thus provide an interesting quantum system in which superfluid, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and a dynamical axion are predicted to follow directly from the axial anomaly in a consistent EFT that may be tested experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We study on-shell functions in the kinematic space for the Coulomb branch of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. We construct BCFW bridges that help us build bigger on-shell functions. As a consequence, we provide on-shell diagram formulations for BCFW shifts that correspond to various mass configurations. We will use this to calculate the quadruple cut for the one-loop amplitude on the Coulomb branch and maximal cuts for higher-loops. We make preliminary comments on finding the inequivalent set of on-shell functions for the Coulomb branch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group $SO(d+1,1)$ makes an appearance both as the conformal group of Euclidean space in $d$ dimensions and as the isometry group of de Sitter spacetime in $d+1$ dimensions. While this common feature can be taken as a hint towards holography on de Sitter space, understanding the representation theory has importance for cosmological applications where de Sitter spacetime is relevant. Among the categories of $SO(d+1,1)$ unitary irreducible representations, discrete series is important in physical applications because they are expected to capture gauge fields. However, they are also the most difficult ones to recognize in field theoretical examples compared to representations from the other categories. Here we point towards some examples where we are able to recognize discrete series representations from fields on de Sitter and highlight some of the properties of these representations.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we review the classical covariant formulation of Yang-Mills theory and general relativity in the presence of spacetime boundaries, focusing mainly on the derivation of the presymplectic forms and their properties. We further revisit the introduction of the edge modes and the conditions which justify them, in the context where only field-independent gauge transformations are considered. We particularly show that the presence of edge modes is not justified by gauge invariance of the presymplectic form, but rather by the condition that the presymplectic form is degenerate on the initial field space, which allows to relate this presymplectic form to the symplectic form on the gauge reduced field space via pullback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, "quasi-local" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new formula called a mode recombination formula, and we can recast the effective potential at finite temperature in one-loop approximation for fermion and scalar fields on the $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}^1 \times R^{D-(p+1)}\times\prod_{i=1}^pS_i^1$ into a convenient form for discussing nonanalytic terms, which cannot be written in the form of any positive integer power of the field-dependent mass squared, in the effective potential. The formula holds irrespective of whether the field is a fermion or a scalar and of boundary conditions for spatial $S_i^1$ directions and clarifies the importance of zero modes in the Matsubara and Kaluza-Klein modes for the existence of the nonanalytic terms. The effective potential is drastically simplified further to obtain the nonanalytic terms in easier and more transparent way. In addition to reproducing previous results, we find that there exists no nonanalytic term for the fermion field with arbitrary boundary condition for the spatial $S_i^1$ direction, which is also the case for the scalar field with the antiperiodic boundary condition for the spatial direction.</description>

      <title>Solution Generation of a Capped Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation developed in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat, stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC) having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2 ]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent. Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

Abstract: We study the integrability and the Bethe/Gauge correspondence of the Generalized Calogero-Moser system proposed by Berntson, Langmann and Lenells which we call the elliptic quadruple Calogero-Moser system (eqCM). We write down the Dunkl operators which give commuting Hamiltonians of the quantum integrable system. We identify the gauge theory in correspondence is a supergroup version of the gauge origami, from which we construct the transfer matrix of the eqCM system.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetry TFT of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory has the peculiar property that its one-form symmetry defects have non-trivial braiding, namely they are charged under the same symmetry they generate, which is then anomalous. This poses a few puzzles in describing the corresponding Symmetry TFT in a four-dimensional bulk. First, the braiding between lines at the boundary seems to be ill-defined when such lines are pulled into the bulk. Second, the Symmetry TFT appears to be too trivial to allow for topological boundary conditions encoding all the different global variants. We show that both of these puzzles can be solved by including endable (tubular) surfaces in the class of bulk topological operators one has to consider. In this way, we are able to reproduce all global variants of the theory, with their symmetries and their anomalies. We check the validity of our proposal also against a top-down holographic realization of the same class of theories.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of symmetry descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many cases the symmetry structure of quantum field theories can be neatly encoded into their associated symmetry theory (SymTFT), a topological field theory in one dimension higher. For geometrically engineered QFTs in string theory this SymTFT has been argued to arise from the background geometry, essentially by integration of the topological sector of string theory on the horizon of the geometry transverse to the QFT locus. In this paper we clarify some subtle aspects of this proposal. We take a higher dimensional approach, where the ten dimensional string theory fields to be integrated arise as edge modes of a topological field theory in eleven dimensions. The resulting construction provides a SymTFT generalisation of the descent procedure for anomalies.</description>

      <title>Assisted baryon number violation from $4k+2$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton decay in six dimensions orbifolded on square $T^2/Z_2$ is highly suppressed at tree-level. This is because baryon number violating (BNV) operators containing only the zero mode of bulk fermions must satisfy the selection rule $\frac{3}{2} \Delta B \pm \frac{1}{2}\Delta L = 0 \ mod \ 4$. In this article, we show that the above relation does not prohibit mass dimension-6 BNV operators containing Kaluza Klein (KK) partners of the bulk fermions. Together with `spinless' adjoint scalar partner of hypercharge gauge boson (the Dark Matter candidate), these novel operators generate Dark Matter assisted proton decay at mass dimension-8. Here, with explicit examples of scalar and vector baryon number violating interactions, we discuss the importance of such $\Delta B=1 =\Delta L$ and $\Delta B=2=\Delta L$ operators and derive the limit on New Physics.</description>

      <title>Inelastic decay from integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of integrable systems is the purely elastic scattering of their excitations. Such systems possess an extensive number of locally conserved charges, leading to the conservation of the number of scattered excitations, as well as their set of individual momenta. In this work, we show that inelastic decay can nevertheless be observed in circuit QED realizations of integrable boundary models. We consider the scattering of microwave photons off impurities in superconducting circuits implementing the boundary sine-Gordon and Kondo models, which are both integrable. We show that not only inelastic decay is possible for the microwave photons, in spite of integrability, and thanks to a nonlinear relation between them and the elastically-scattered excitations, but also that integrability in fact provides powerful analytical tools allowing to obtain exact expressions for response functions describing the inelastic decay. Using the framework of form factors, we calculate the total inelastic decay rate and elastic phase shift of the microwave photons, extracted from a 2-point response function. We then go beyond linear response and obtain the exact energy-resolved inelastic decay spectrum, using a novel method to evaluate form factor expansions of 3-point response functions, which could prove useful in other applications of integrable quantum field theories. We relate our results to several recent photon splitting experiments, and in particular to recent experimental data that provides evidence for the elusive Schmid-Bulgadaev dissipative quantum phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00930v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Image of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by equatorial thin accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of the cosmological constant on black hole images, we have developed a comprehensive analytical method for simulating images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by equatorial thin accretion disks. Through the application of explicit equations, we simulate images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by both prograde and retrograde accretion disks, examining the impact of the cosmological constant on their characteristic curves, relative sizes, and observed intensities. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to Kerr black holes, the cosmological constant not only diminishes the relative size of a black hole but also amplifies its luminosity. Moreover, an observer's relative position in the universe ($r_0/r_C$) can influence both the relative size and luminosity of a black hole, where $r_0$ is the distance from the observer to the black hole, $r_C$ is the cosmological horizon determined by the value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in gravitational waves and observational bounds from third-generation detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze parity-violating effects in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). For this purpose, we adopt a newly proposed parametrized post-Einstenian (PPE) formalism, which encodes modified gravity corrections to the phase and amplitude of GW waveforms. In particular, we focus our study on three well-known examples of parity-violating theories, namely Chern-Simons, Symmetric Teleparallel and Hor\v ava-Lishitz gravity. For each model, we identify the PPE parameters emerging from the inclusion of parity-violating terms in the gravitational Lagrangian. Thus, we use the simulated sensitivities of third-generation GW interferometers, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, to obtain numerical bounds on the PPE coefficients and the physical parameters of binary systems. In so doing, we find that deviations from General Relativity cannot be excluded within given confidence limits. Moreover, our results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in the relative accuracy of the GW parameters compared to the values inferred from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. In this respect, the present work demonstrates the power of next-generation GW detectors to probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Static sphere observers and geodesics in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze null- and spacelike radial geodesics in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime connecting two conjugate static sphere observers, i.e. free-falling observers at a fixed radius in between the two horizons. We explicitly determine the changes in the causal structure with respect to these natural observers as a result of the inward bending of the black hole singularity, as well as the outward bending of asymptotic infinity. Notably, the inward and outward bending changes as a function of the black hole mass, first increasing towards a maximum and then decreasing to vanish in the extreme Nariai limit. For a generic mass of the black hole this implies the existence of finite size (temporal) windows for the presence of symmetric radial geodesics between the static sphere observers probing the interior region of the black hole, as well as the exterior de Sitter region. We determine the size of the interior (black hole) and exterior (de Sitter) temporal windows in $4$, $5$ and $6$ spacetime dimensions, finding that they are equal in $D=5$, and compute the proper lengths of the symmetric radial geodesics. We comment on the implications for information exchange and the potential role of the symmetric radial geodesics in a geodesic approximation of static sphere correlators in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Finding origins of CMB anomalies in the inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

Abstract: Ever since its discovery by Roy Kerr in 1963, the geometry around rotating, electrostatically-neutral black holes, otherwise known as Kerr black holes, has significantly contributed to theoretical developments in the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and beyond. Extremal Kerr black holes, in which the spin parameter of the rotating black hole is at a maximum without breaching certain postulates, has especially been of interest to the research community due to its sensitivity to higher order corrections to Einstein's theory of relativity. In this paper, we review some unresolved open questions regarding the discontinuity of certain properties of the Kerr black hole as it approaches the extreme limit. These include the form of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the nature of vanishing entropy, and the disappearance of the trapped surface as a Kerr black hole approaches extremality. We conclude that current theories are likely not suitable for studies of extremal black holes, and we posit that further development in theory may likely require a quantum approach to gravity. G=c=1 and Einstein summation convention are assumed throughout this paper.</description>
