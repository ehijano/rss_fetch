      <title>Ulam meets Turing: constructing quadratic maps with non-computable SRB measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1946, S. Ulam invented Monte Carlo method, which has since become the standard numerical technique for making statistical predictions for long-term behaviour of dynamical systems. We show that this, or in fact any other numerical approach can fail for the simplest non-linear discrete dynamical systems given by the logistic maps $f_{a}(x)=ax(1-x)$ of the unit interval. We show that there exist computable real parameters $a\in (0,4)$ for which almost every orbit of $f_a$ has the same asymptotical statistical distribution in $[0,1]$, but this limiting distribution is not Turing computable.</description>

      <title>Existence of Invariant Measures for Delay Equations with Stochastic Negative Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of invariant probability measures for generic stochastic differential equations with finite time delay. Applications include the Mackey--Glass equations and Nicholson's blowflies equation, each perturbed by a (small) multiplicative noise term. Solutions to these stochastic negative feedback systems persist globally and all solutions are bounded above in probability. It turns out that the occurrence of finite time blowups and boundedness in probability of solutions and solution segments are closely related. A non-trivial invariant measure is shown to exist if and only if there is at least one initial condition for which the solution remains bounded away from zero in probability. The noise driving the dynamical system is allowed to be an integrable L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>Historical behavior of skew products and arcsine laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of historical behavior for almost every point in the setting of skew products with one-dimensional fiber dynamics. Under suitable ergodic conditions, we establish that a weak form of the arcsine law leads to the non-convergence of Birkhoff averages along almost every orbit. As an application, we show that this phenomenon occurs for one-step skew product maps over a Bernoulli shift, where the stochastic process induced by the iterates of the fiber maps is conjugate to a random walk.
  Furthermore, we revisit known examples of skew products that exhibit historical behavior almost everywhere, verifying that they fulfill the required ergodic and probabilistic conditions. Consequently, our results provide a unified and generalized framework that connects such behaviors to the arcsine distribution of the orbits.</description>

      <title>Global convergence for time-periodic systems with negative feedback and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the discrete-time dynamical system generated by the Poincare map T of a time-periodic closed-loop negative feedback system, we present an amenable condition which enables us to obtain the global convergence of the orbits. This yields the global convergence to the harmonic periodic solutions of the corresponding time-periodic systems with negative feedback. Our approach is motivated by embedding the negative feedback system into a larger time-periodic monotone dynamical systems. We further utilize the theoretical results to obtain the global convergence to periodic solutions for the time periodically-forced gene regulatory models. Numerical simulations are exhibited to illustrate the feasibility of our theoretical results for this model.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Transformations and Their Discrete Maharam Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two abstract constructions for building new measurable dynamical systems from existing ones and study their ergodic properties. The first of these constructions, a "reciprocal transformation," produces a type of non-singular transformation where the measures of subsets are distorted in a simple way. We then introduce the "discrete Maharam extension" which associates an infinite measure-preserving transformation to each reciprocal transformations. We give some preliminary results about the ergodic theory of each of these constructions, mention ongoing work, as well as conjectures and questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric uniformization of cellular branched covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of branched covering maps on topological $n$-spheres $\mathcal{S}^n$ called expanding cellular Markov branched covers which might be viewed as analogs of expanding Thurston maps. Similarly as expanding Thurston maps, expanding cellular Markov branched covers admit visual metrics. In this paper, we study the quasisymmetric uniformization problem corresponding to visual metrics of expanding cellular Markov branched covers. More precisely, for a cellular Markov branched cover $f\colon \mathbb{S}^n\to \mathbb{S}^n$ and a visual metric $\varrho$ of $f$, we prove that $\varrho$ is quasisymmetrically equivalent to the chordal metric if and only if $f$ is uniformly quasiregular, and the local multiplicity of the family $\{f^m\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded uniformly.</description>

      <title>Inheritance of shadowing for dynamical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the single-perturbation approach (developed in our earlier publications for the case of a single map) to the analysis of the shadowing property for semigroups of endomorphisms. Our approach allows to give a constructive representation for a true trajectory which shadows a given pseudo-trajectory. One of the main motivations is the question of inheritance: does the presence of shadowing for all generators of a semigroup imply shadowing for the semigroup and vice versa. Somewhat surprisingly, the answer to these questions is generally negative. Moreover, the situation with shadowing turns out to be quite different in a semigroup and in a non-autonomous system, despite the fact that the latter can be represented as a single branch of the former.</description>

Abstract: We present a disease transmission model that considers both explicit and non-explicit factors. This approach is crucial for accurate prediction and control of infectious disease spread. In this paper, we extend the spread model from our previous works \cite{ban2021mathematical,ban2023randomspread, ban2023mathematical, ban2023spread} to a projected spread model that considers both hidden and explicit types. Additionally, we provide the spread rate for the projected spread model corresponding to the topological and random models. Furthermore, examples and numerical results are provided to illustrate the theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper enriches the topological horseshoe theory using finite subshift theory in symbolic dynamical systems, and develops an elementary framework addressing incomplete crossing and semi-horseshoes. Two illustrative examples are provided: one from the perturbed Duffing system and another from a polynomial system proposed by Chen, demonstrating the prevalence of semi-horseshoes in chaotic systems. Moreover, the semi-topological horseshoe theory enhances the detection of chaos and improves the accuracy of topological entropy estimation.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of contact Hamiltonian systems II: Variational construction of asymptotic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our study of the dynamics of contact Hamiltonian systems in \cite{JY}, but without monotonicity assumption. Due to the complexity of general cases, we focus on the behavior of action minimizing orbits. We pick out certain action minimizing invariant sets $\{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}_u\}$ in the phase space naturally stratified by solutions $u$ to the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using an extension of characteristic method, we establish the existence of semi-infinite orbits that is asymptotic to some $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}_u$ and heteroclinic orbits between $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}_u$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}_v$ for two different solutions $u$ and $v$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pendulum Forced by a Magnetic Excitation with Position-Dependent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a magnetic pendulum under time-varying magnetic excitation with a position-dependent phase. The system exhibits complex chaotic and regular dynamics, validated through simulations and experiments. The mathematical model, based on a physical setup, includes a magnetic excitation torque with phase dependence on the dynamic variable. Bifurcation analyses confirm the rich multistability of the system, showcasing periodic attractors, period-doubling bifurcations, and chaotic behavior. Experimental validation demonstrates a high agreement between numerical and experimental results, supporting the efficacy of the proposed model. The study sheds light on the system's sensitivity to changes in magnetic interaction, providing insights into controlling resonance energy exchange in coupled magnetic pendulum systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the relation between the functions that give first integrals of full symmetric Toda system (an important Hamilton system on the space of traceless real symmetric matrices) and the vector fields on the group of orthogonal matrices: it is known that this system is equivalent to an ordinary differential equation on the orthogonal group, and we extend this observation further to its first integrals. As a by-product we describe a representation of the Lie algebra of $B^+(\R)$-invariant functions on the dual space of Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\R)$ (under the canonical Poisson structure) by vector fields on $SO_n(\R)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. Thus, any two words in $\mathcal{W}_n$ have a common subsequence of length $n-o(n)$, which implies that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Bernoulli. The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt{n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <title>NN-ResDMD: Learning Koopman Representations for Complex Dynamics with Spectral Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing long-term behaviors in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains a significant challenge. The Koopman operator framework has emerged as a powerful tool to address this issue by providing a globally linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics. However, existing methods for approximating the Koopman operator and its spectral components, particularly in large-scale systems, often lack robust theoretical guarantees. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduces a spectral residual measure to assess the convergence of the estimated Koopman spectrum, which helps filter out spurious spectral components. Nevertheless, it depends on pre-computed spectra, thereby inheriting their inaccuracies. To overcome its limitations, we introduce the Neural Network-ResDMD (NN-ResDMD), a method that directly estimates Koopman spectral components by minimizing the spectral residual. By leveraging neural networks, NN-ResDMD automatically identifies the optimal basis functions of the Koopman invariant subspace, eliminating the need for manual selection and improving the reliability of the analysis. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate that NN-ResDMD significantly improves both accuracy and scalability, making it an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Model of an Open, Decentralized Computational Network with Incentive-Based Load Balancing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model that enables permissionless and decentralized networks for complex computations. We explore the integration and optimize load balancing in an open, decentralized computational network. Our model leverages economic incentives and reputation-based mechanisms to dynamically allocate tasks between operators and coprocessors. This approach eliminates the need for specialized hardware or software, thereby reducing operational costs and complexities. We present a mathematical model that enhances restaking processes in blockchain systems by enabling operators to delegate complex tasks to coprocessors. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental simulations, showcasing its ability to optimize reward distribution, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency.
  Our approach facilitates a more flexible and scalable network through the use of economic commitments, adaptable dynamic rating models, and a coprocessor load incentivization system. Supported by experimental simulations, the model demonstrates its capability to optimize resource allocation, enhance system resilience, and reduce operational risks. This ensures significant improvements in both security and cost-efficiency for the blockchain ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Random walks and Lorentz processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks and Lorentz processes serve as fundamental models for Brownian motion. The study of random walks is a favorite object of probability theory, whereas that of Lorentz processes belongs to the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Here, we first present examples where the method based on the probabilistic approach led to new insights into the study of the Lorentz process. Motivated by a 1981 question of Sinai about limiting laws for planar locally perturbed Lorentz processes, we first derived that, in the plane, local perturbations of homogeneous random walks leave the limit laws and the limiting processes unchanged - independently whether the walk had bounded or unbounded jumps. Afterward, we obtained probabilistic statements for local perturbations of planar Lorentz processes with finite horizon. (Similar statements for local perturbations of Lorentz processes with infinite horizon is a most interesting open problem!) Often an interesting consequence of a local limit theorem for a process is the recurrence of the same process. In this way, our approach also provides an alternative proof for a 2003 result of Lenci about the recurrence of the locally perturbed Lorentz processes with finite horizon. Afterward an unsolved problem, related to Sinai 1981 question, is formulated as an analogous problem in the language of random walks.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate the $q$-difference linear system corresponding to the $q$-Painlev\'e equation of type $A_7^{(1)'}$ as a Riemann-Hilbert problem on a circle. Then, we consider the Fredholm determinant built from the jump of this Riemann-Hilbert problem and prove that it satisfies bilinear relations equivalent to $P(A_7^{(1)'})$. We also find the minor expansion of this Fredholm determinant in explicit factorized form and prove that it coincides with the Fourier series in $q$-deformed conformal blocks, or partition functions of the pure $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory, including the cases with the Chern-Simons term. Finally, we solve the connection problem for these isomonodromic tau functions, finding in this way their global behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of periodic perturbations of an attracting robust heteroclinic cycle defined on the two-sphere is studied by reducing the analysis to that of a one-parameter family of maps on a circle. The set of zeros of the family forms a bifurcation diagram on the cylinder. The different bifurcation diagrams and the transitions between them are obtained as the strength of attraction of the cycle and the amplitude of the periodic perturbation vary. We determine a threshold in the cycle's attraction strength above which frequency locked periodic solutions with arbitrarily long periods bifurcate from the cycle as the period of the perturbation decreases. Below this threshold further transitions are found giving rise to a frequency locked invariant torus and to a frequency locked suspended horseshoe, arising from heteroclinic tangencies in the family of maps.</description>

Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of ergodic averages and other stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ergodic map $T$ and a non-constant, real-valued $f \in L^1$, the ergodic averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x) = \frac{1} {N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(T^n x)$ converge a.e., but the convergence is never monotone. Depending on particular properties of the function $f$, the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ may or may not actually fluctuate around the mean value infinitely often a.e. We will prove that a.e. fluctuation around the mean is the generic behavior. That is, for a fixed ergodic $T$, the generic non-constant $f\in L^1$ has the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ fluctuating around the mean infinitely often for almost every $x$. We also consider fluctuation for other stochastic processes like subsequences of the ergodic averages, convolution operators, weighted averages, uniform distribution and martingales. We will show that in general, in these settings fluctuation around the limit infinitely often persists as the generic behavior.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduction of the Finite-Element Model of a Tribomechadynamics Benchmark Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bolted joints can exhibit nonsmooth and significantly nonlinear dynamics. Finite Element Models (FEMs) of this phenomenon require fine spatial discretizations, inclusion of nonlinear contact and friction laws, as well as geometric nonlinearity. Owing to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of such models, full-order dynamic simulations are computationally expensive. In this work, we use the theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs) to construct a data-driven, smoothed reduced model for a 187,920-dimensional FEM model of a broadly studied Tribomechadynamics benchmark structure with bolted joints. We train the 4-dimensional reduced model using only a few transient trajectories of the full unforced FEM model. We show that this smooth model accurately predicts the experimentally observed nonlinear forced response of the full nonsmooth benchmark problem.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Invariant Distributions of Partially Hyperbolic Systems: Fractal Graphs, Excessive Regularity, and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach linking fractal geometry to partially hyperbolic dynamics, revealing several new phenomena related to regularity jumps and rigidity. One key result demonstrates a sharp phase transition for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms $f \in \mathrm{Diff}^\infty_{\mathrm{vol}}(\mathbb{T}^3)$ with a contracting center direction: $f$ is $C^\infty$-rigid if and only if both $E^s$ and $E^c$ exhibit H\"older exponents exceeding the expected threshold. Specifically, we prove:
  If the H\"older exponent of $E^s$ exceeds the expected value, then $E^s$ is $C^{1+}$ and $E^u \oplus E^s$ is jointly integrable.
  If the H\"older exponent of $E^c$ exceeds the expected value, then $W^c$ forms a $C^{1+}$ foliation.
  If $E^s$ (or $E^c$) does not exhibit excessive H\"older regularity, it must have a fractal graph.
  These and related results originate from a general non-fractal invariance principle: for a skew product $F$ over a partially hyperbolic system $f$, if $F$ expands fibers more weakly than $f$ along $W^u_f$ in the base, then for any $F$-invariant section, if $\Phi$ has no a fractal graph, then it is smooth along $W^u_f$ and holonomy-invariant.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new conjecture on the stable fractal or stable smooth behavior of invariant distributions in typical partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a topologically transitive system on the unit interval, one can investigate the cover time, i.e. time for an orbit to reach certain level of resolution in the repeller. We introduce a new notion of dimension, namely the stretched Minkowski dimension, and show that under mixing conditions, the asymptotics of typical cover times are determined by Minkowski dimensions when they are finite, or by stretched Minkowski dimensions otherwise. For application, we show that for countably full-branched affine maps, results using the usual Minkowski dimensions fail to produce a finite log limit of cover times whilst the stretched version gives an finite limit. In addition, cover times of irrational rotations are explicitly calculated as counterexamples, due to the absence of mixing.</description>

      <title>Real Forms of Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By complexifying a Hamiltonian system one obtains dynamics on a holomorphic symplectic manifold. To invert this construction we present a theory of real forms which not only recovers the original system but also yields different real Hamiltonian systems which share the same complexification. This provides a notion of real forms for holomorphic Hamiltonian systems analogous to that of real forms for complex Lie algebras. Our main result is that the complexification of any analytic mechanical system on a Grassmannian admits a real form on a compact symplectic manifold. This produces a `unitary trick' for Hamiltonian systems which curiously requires an essential use of hyperk\"ahler geometry. We demonstrate this result by finding compact real forms for the simple pendulum, the spherical pendulum, and the rigid body.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of the notion of in-splits from symbolic dynamics to topological graphs and, more generally, to C*-correspondences. We demonstrate that in-splits provide examples of strong shift equivalences of C*-correspondences. Furthermore, we provide a streamlined treatment of Muhly, Pask, and Tomforde's proof that any strong shift equivalence of regular C*-correspondences induces a (gauge-equivariant) Morita equivalence between Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. For topological graphs, we prove that in-splits induce diagonal-preserving gauge-equivariant *-isomorphisms in analogy with the results for Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Additionally, we examine the notion of out-splits for C*-correspondences.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and averaging in partially hyperbolic systems with fast and slow variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of dynamical systems obtained by coupling an Anosov map on the two-dimensional torus -- the chaotic system -- with the identity map on the one-dimensional torus -- the neutral system -- through a dissipative interaction. We show that the two systems synchronize: the trajectories evolve toward an attracting invariant manifold, and the full dynamics is conjugated to its linearization around the invariant manifold. As a byproduct, we obtain that there exists a unique exponentially mixing physical measure. When the interaction is small, the evolution of the variable which describes the neutral system is very close to the identity; hence, it appears as a slow variable with respect to the variable which describes the chaotic system, and which is wherefore named the fast variable. We demonstrate that, seen on a suitably long time scale, the slow variable effectively follows the solution of a deterministic differential equation obtained by averaging over the fast variable. More precisely, we prove that the invariant manifold is in probability close to the fixed point of the averaged dynamics and that the difference between the exact evolution of the slow variable, seen from the invariant manifold, and its averaged evolution is in probability exponentially decreasing for arbitrarily large times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, J. Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors) spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, every year millions of people become victims of this disease and many even lose their lives. Medical professionals and the government could take accurate measures to protect the people only when the disease dynamics are understood clearly. In this work, we propose a compartmental model to study the dynamics of malaria. We consider the transmission rate dependent on temperature and altitude. We performed the steady state analysis on the proposed model and checked the stability of the disease-free and endemic steady state. An artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the formulated model to predict the trajectory of all five compartments following the mathematical analysis. Three different neural network architectures namely Artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), and Recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to estimate these parameters from the trajectory of the data. To understand the severity of a disease, it is essential to calculate the risk associated with the disease. In this work, the risk is calculated using dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) from the trajectory of the infected people.</description>

Abstract: We provide a 3 dimensional contact geometric characterization of Anosov 3-flows based on interactions with Reeb dynamics. We investigate basic properties of the space of the resulting geometries. A technical theorem on asymptotic synchronization of adapted norms is proved, which can be of broader interest.</description>
