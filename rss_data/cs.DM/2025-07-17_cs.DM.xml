      <title>Quantitative Edge Eigenvector Universality for Random Regular Graphs: Berry-Esseen Bounds with Explicit Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds for edge eigenvector statistics in random regular graphs. For any $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with fixed $d \geq 3$ and deterministic unit vector $\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{e}$, we prove that the normalized overlap $\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle$ satisfies \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \left|\mathbb{P}\left(\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle \leq x\right) - \Phi(x)\right| \leq C_d N^{-1/6+\varepsilon} \] where $\mathbf{u}_2$ is the second eigenvector and $C_d \leq \tilde{C}d^3\varepsilon^{-10}$ for an absolute constant $\tilde{C}$. This provides the first explicit convergence rate for the recent edge eigenvector universality results of He, Huang, and Yau \cite{HHY25}.
  Our proof introduces a single-scale comparison method using constrained Dyson Brownian motion that preserves the degree constraint $\tilde{H}_t\mathbf{e} = 0$ throughout the evolution. The key technical innovation is a sharp edge isotropic local law with explicit constant $C(d,\varepsilon) \leq \tilde{C}d\varepsilon^{-5}$, enabling precise control of eigenvector overlap dynamics.
  At the critical time $t_* = N^{-1/3+\varepsilon}$, we perform a fourth-order cumulant comparison with constrained GOE, achieving optimal error bounds through a single comparison rather than the traditional multi-scale approach. We extend our results to joint universality for the top $K$ edge eigenvectors with $K \leq N^{1/10-\delta}$, showing they converge to independent Gaussians. Through analysis of eigenvalue spacing barriers, critical time scales, and comparison across multiple proof methods, we provide evidence that the $N^{-1/6}$ rate is optimal for sparse regular graphs. All constants are tracked explicitly throughout, enabling finite-size applications in spectral algorithms and network analysis.</description>

      <title>The complete edge relaxation for binary polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the multilinear polytope defined as the convex hull of the feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial optimization problem. We define a relaxation in an extended space for this polytope, which we refer to as the complete edge relaxation. The complete edge relaxation is stronger than several well-known relaxations of the multilinear polytope, including the standard linearization, the flower relaxation, and the intersection of all possible recursive McCormick relaxations. We prove that the complete edge relaxation is an extension of the multilinear polytope if and only if the corresponding hypergraph is alpha-acyclic; i.e., the most general type of hypergraph acyclicity. This is in stark contrast with the widely-used standard linearization which describes the multilinear polytope if and only if the hypergraph is Berge-acyclic; i.e., the most restrictive type of hypergraph acyclicity. We then introduce a new class of facet-defining inequalities for the multilinear polytope of alpha-cycles of length three, which serve as the generalization of the well-known triangle inequalities for the Boolean quadric polytope.</description>

      <title>A 1/2-Approximation for Budgeted $k$-Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by taking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike standard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for the solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the subset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that the greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular maximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether a firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack constraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question affirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses an appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the greedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically tight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many value oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We further show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone problem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it well-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from (Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\tilde O(n^2k^2)$ time.
  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from an optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to evaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous analysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved approximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method naturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader constraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>

      <title>Chorded cycle facets of the clique partitioning polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities are a class of valid inequalities for the clique partitioning polytope. It is known that for $q \in \{2, \tfrac{k-1}{2}\}$, these inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if $k$ is odd. Here, we characterize such facets for arbitrary $k$ and $q$. More specifically, we prove that the $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if two conditions are satisfied: $k = 1$ mod $q$, and if $k=3q+1$ then $q=3$ or $q$ is even. This establishes the existence of many facets induced by $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities beyond those previously known.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums.
  We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes.
  To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds.
  Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>From Signed Networks to Group Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define a "group graph" which encodes the symmetry in a dynamical process on a network. Group graphs extend signed networks, where links are labelled with plus or minus one, by allowing link labels from any group and generalising the standard notion of balance. I show that for processes on a balanced group graph the time evolution is completely determined by the network topology, not by the group structure. This unifies and extends recent findings on signed networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024a) and complex networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024b). I will also relate the results discussed here to related work such as the "group graph" of Harary (1982), a "voltage graph" (Gross, 1974) and a "gain graph" (Zaslavsky 1989). Finally, I will review some promising applications for network dynamics and symmetry-driven modelling including status, edges with a zero label, weak balance, unbalanced group graphs and using monoids.</description>
