      <title>Residual Symmetry Reductions and Painlev\'e Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces the novel concept of Painlev\'e solitons -- waves arising from the interaction between Painlev\'e waves and solitons in integrable systems. Painlev\'e solitons may also be viewed as solitons propagating against a Painlev\'e wave background, in analogy with the established notion of elliptic solitons, which refer to solitons on an elliptic wave background. By employing a novel symmetry decomposition method aided by nonlocal residual symmetries, we explicitly construct (extended) Painlev\'e II solitons for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and (extended) Painlev\'e IV solitons for the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-droplet interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose atom interferometers based on quantum droplet (QD), which is also being reported as a superior platform for interferometry. The emphasis has been given to harmonic-oscillator (HO) or ring-shaped potentials. In the HO trap, a Gaussian barrier induces coherent splitting; in the ring, one or two barriers guide the splitting and subsequent recombination. The atom number and relative mean-field interaction strength critically affect the interferometric performance. The transmission-coefficient analysis identifies values of the barrier parameters for the balanced $50:50$ splitting. The post-recombination atom-number imbalance serves as a sensitive indicator of the relative phase between merging daughter QDs. We demonstrate that the HO-based setup may serve as a tilt-meter and target detector, and the ring geometry may be used as a compact QD Sagnac interferometer for rotation sensing.</description>

      <title>Controller for rejection of the first harmonic in a periodic signal with uncertain delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plant (the system to be controlled) is disturbed by a periodic external force with a broad spectrum of Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) is assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by a control force, whereas the other harmonics should be preserved without distortion. Because the measured plant data have an unknown amount of time delay (dead time) and the sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, therefore the amplitude and phase of a sine-type control force are also unknown. Based on the internal model principle, we developed a feedback controller described as a linear time-invariant system that can remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting its control force parameters. Using this controller, we aimed to further extend the capabilities of a newly developed high-speed, large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy. In such a scanning technique, the sample is rotated, and the tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces a parasitic first Fourier harmonic, which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>
