      <title>Beyond the Numbers: Causal Effects of Financial Report Sentiment on Bank Profitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study establishes the causal effects of market sentiment on firm profitability, moving beyond traditional correlational analyses. It leverages a causal forest machine learning methodology to control for numerous confounding variables, enabling systematic analysis of heterogeneity and non-linearities often overlooked. A key innovation is the use of a pre-trained FinancialBERT to generate sentiment scores from quarterly reports, which are then treated as causal interventions impacting profitability dynamics like returns and volatilities. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from NEPSE, NRB, and individual financial institutions, the research employs SHAP analysis to identify influential profit predictors. A two-pronged causal analysis further explores how sentiment's impact is conditioned by Loan Portfolio/Asset Composition and Balance Sheet Strength/Leverage. Average Treatment Effect analyses, combined with SHAP insights, reveal statistically significant causal associations between certain balance sheet and expense management variables and profitability. This advanced causal machine learning framework significantly extends existing literature, providing a more robust understanding of how financial sentiment truly impacts firm performance.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Evolving Composition of Inbound Tourism Demand: A Bayesian Compositional Time Series Approach Using Platform Booking Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the composition of guest origin markets evolves over time is critical for destination marketing organizations, hospitality businesses, and tourism planners. We develop and apply Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average (BDARMA) models to forecast the compositional dynamics of guest origin market shares using proprietary Airbnb booking data spanning 2017--2024 across four major destination regions. Our analysis reveals substantial pandemic-induced structural breaks in origin composition, with heterogeneous recovery patterns across markets. The BDARMA framework achieves the lowest average forecast error across all destination regions, outperforming standard benchmarks including na\"ive forecasts, exponential smoothing, and SARIMA on log-ratio transformed data. For EMEA destinations, BDARMA achieves 23% lower forecast error than naive methods, with statistically significant improvements. By modeling compositions directly on the simplex with a Dirichlet likelihood and incorporating seasonal variation in both mean and precision parameters, our approach produces coherent forecasts that respect the unit-sum constraint while capturing complex temporal dependencies. The methodology provides destination stakeholders with probabilistic forecasts of source market shares, enabling more informed strategic planning for marketing resource allocation, infrastructure investment, and crisis response.</description>
