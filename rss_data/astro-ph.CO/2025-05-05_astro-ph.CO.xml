      <title>ACT DR6 Insights on the Inflationary Attractor models and Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models and their post-inflationary reheating dynamics in light of the latest CMB data from ACT DR6 combined with Planck18, BICEP/$Keck$ 2018, and DESI (collectively denoted P-ACT-LB-BK18). Focusing on both E and T type attractor potentials, we analyze how inflationary observables namely the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are indirectly influenced by reheating parameters such as the reheating temperature $T_{\text{RH}}$, the inflaton equation-of-state $w_\phi$, and the inflaton's couplings to Starndard Model particles. We incorporate indirect constraints from the overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly via $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds on BBN, which become significant for stiff post-inflationary dynamics. Our results show that E-models permit a wide range of reheating scenarios, including matter-like reheating ($w_\phi = 0$), while T-models are viable only for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.44$. We derive bounds on inflaton-Standard Model couplings for both decay and scattering channels and identify parameter regimes compatible with recent ACT data for successful reheating. These findings establish a robust connection between inflationary theory, thermal history, and particle phenomenology, and provide predictive targets for future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>SHAPE: cosmology with cluster halo intrinsic alignments from subhalo distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters trace the most massive dark matter haloes, whose shapes and orientations reflect the imprint of the cosmic large-scale tidal field. This paper introduces the Subhalo-based Halo Alignment and Projected Ellipticity (SHAPE) technique, which reconstructs cluster halo shapes from the projected distribution of subhaloes, providing a novel approach to investigate intrinsic alignment (IA) correlations between cluster halo shapes and the surrounding density field. We measure halo shapes and orientations using different line-of-sight projection depths and find that, with modest projection depths, the shapes and orientations recovered by SHAPE show good agreement with those measured directly from the simulation particles. Using these SHAPE-derived shapes, we compute IA correlation functions from N-body simulations in both real and redshift space. The IA correlation multipoles exhibit features consistent with baryon acoustic oscillations around 100 Mpc/h and show redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects that agree well with predictions from a non-linear alignment model incorporating RSD. We further demonstrate that the structure growth rate parameter can be robustly estimated without bias from these IA correlations, providing a new avenue for cosmological parameter estimation. Expanding the IA correlations in an associated Legendre basis yields results consistent with those from the standard Legendre expansion, but with improved statistical significance. These results suggest that SHAPE may enhance cosmological parameter constraints in future galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Hubble constant, sound horizon and cosmography from late-time Universe observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has become one of the central problems in cosmology. In this work, we determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ and sound horizon $r_d$ by using the combination of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) from DESI surveys, time-delay lensed quasars from H0LiCOW collaborations and the Pantheon supernovae observations. We consider two cosmological approaches, i.e., Taylor series and Pad\'{e} polynomials, to avoid cosmological dependence. The reason for using this combination of data is that the absolute distance provided by strong gravitational lensing helps anchor the relative distance of BAO, and supernovae provide a robust history of universe evolution. {{Combining the 6 time-delay distance (6$D_{\Delta t}$) plus 4 angular diameter distance to the deflector (4$D_d$) measurements of time-delay lensed quasars,}} the BAO and the type Ia of supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets, we obtain a model-independent result of $r_d = 138.2_{-3.9}^{+3.3}$ Mpc and $H_0 = 72.9^{+1.8}_{-1.8}$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ for the Taylor series cosmography and $r_d = 137.0_{-3.7}^{+3.2}$ Mpc and $H_0 = 73.1_{-1.7}^{+1.8}$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ for the Pad\'{e} polynomials cosmography. The determination of $r_d$ and $H_0$ prefers larger $H_0$ and smaller $r_d$ than Planck data under the assumption of flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. However, the values of $H_0$ are consistent with the $H_0$ determination from SH0ES collaboration.</description>

      <title>RVSNUpy: A Python Package for Spectroscopic Redshift Measurement Based on Cross-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RVSNUpy, a new Python package designed to measure spectroscopic redshifts. Based on inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation, RVSNUpy determines the redshifts by comparing observed spectra with various rest-frame template spectra. We test the performance of RVSNUpy based on ~ 6000 objects in the HectoMAP redshift survey observed with both SDSS and MMT/Hectospec. We demonstrate that a slight redshift offset (~ 40 km/s) between SDSS and MMT/Hectospec measurements reported from previous studies results from the small offsets in the redshift template spectra used for SDSS and Hectospec reductions. We construct the universal set of template spectra, including empirical SDSS template spectra, carefully calibrated to the rest frame. Our test for the HectoMAP objects with duplicated observations shows that RVSNUpy with the universal template spectra yields the homogeneous redshift from the spectra obtained with different spectrographs. We highlight that RVSNUpy is a powerful redshift measurement tool for current and future large-scale spectroscopy surveys, including A-SPEC, DESI, 4MOST, and Subaru/PFS.</description>

      <title>The Boost Operator: Properties, Computation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation of radiation signals (e.g., photon occupation number and integrated intensity) between moving frames is a common task is physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Here we show that the required boost operator, relating the frequency-dependent spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients of the considered observable between the frames, is directly given by the aberration kernel with the Doppler weight parameter being replaced by a differential operator. The aberration kernel has been previously studied in great detail, meaning that this simplification allows us to directly compute the boost operator using the expressions of the aberration kernel. As a preparatory step, we generalize the differential equation that determines the aberration kernel to general Doppler weight. This avoids the intermediate step of Doppler-weight raising and lowering operations in computations of the boost operator. We then clarify all the properties of the boost operator (e.g., raising and lowering operations, symmetries and commutation relations) and derive a formal operator differential equation for the boost operator. This differential equation allows us to quickly generate the boost operator for which we give exact expressions up to second order in v/c. For illustration, we then apply the boost operator to transformations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), validating that measurements of the lowest CMB multipoles do not allow determining the amplitude of the primordial CMB dipole. We also derive the kinematic corrections to the Thomson scattering process (to all orders in v/c), giving explicit expressions up to second order in v/c, showcasing an application of the boost operator in radiative transfer problems.</description>

      <title>On the tension between DESI DR2 BAO and CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement shows inconsistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation in $\Lambda$CDM. We used the Bayesian suspiciousness and goodness-of-fit tension metrics to quantify the significance of the tension. Both tension metrics consistently confirm a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between DESI BAO and CMB. We identified the key assumptions of $\Lambda$CDM underlying the tension between BAO and CMB. If the tension is physical, one or multiple of the assumptions might need to be broken by the potential new physics addressing the tension. In particular, the analysis shows that if dynamical dark energy is the only new physics behind the tension, phantom crossing is required to restore concordance between CMB and BAO.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ significantly enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data, suggesting that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Prospects for disentangling dark matter with weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the degeneracy between the effects of ultra-light axion dark matter and baryonic feedback in suppressing the matter power spectrum. We forecast that galaxy shear data from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) could limit an axion of mass $m = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to be $\lesssim 5\%$ of the dark matter, stronger than any current bound, if the interplay between axions and feedback is accurately modelled. Using a halo model emulator to construct power spectra for mixed cold and axion dark matter cosmologies, including baryonic effects, we find that galaxy shear is sensitive to axions from $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the capacity to set competitive bounds across much of this range. For axions with $m \sim 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the scales at which axions and feedback impact structure formation are similar, introducing a parameter degeneracy. We find that, with an external feedback constraint, we can break the degeneracy and constrain the axion transfer function, such that LSST could detect a $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ axion comprising 10\% of the dark matter at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. Direct reconstruction of the non-linear matter power spectrum provides an alternative way of analysing weak lensing surveys, with the advantage of identifying the scale-dependent features in the data that the dark matter model imposes. We advocate for dedicated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with an axion dark matter component so that upcoming galaxy and cosmic microwave background lensing surveys can disentangle the dark matter-baryon transfer function.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Higgs Inflation with ACT Observations through Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs inflation model with nonminimal coupling, while disfavored by the 1$\sigma$ region of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) observational data, can be reconciled with the ACT data by incorporating the effects of reheating. In this paper, we consider reheating with a constant equation of state $w_{re}$. To simultaneously satisfy the ACT data and ensure that the temperature at the end of reheating is above the threshold required for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we find that the equation of state must satisfy $w_{re} \gtrsim 2/3$. For the special cases of $w_{ re} = 2/3$ and $w_{ re} = 1$, the number of e-folds during reheating must lie within the ranges $31.6 \leq N_{ re} \leq 32.8$ and $15.8 \leq N_{ re} \leq 27.3$, respectively. Our findings suggest that by considering reheating, a wide range of inflationary models, such as $R^2$ inflation, hilltop inflation, E-model inflation, and T-model inflation, can also be made consistent with the ACT observational data.</description>

      <title>Addressing the too-big-to-fail problem and the void phenomenon through a modified initial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of early-time initial conditions on nonlinear structure formation and evolution within the framework of the semi-analytical Excursion Set Theory (EST). Our analysis reveals that adding a Gaussian bump to the initial curvature power spectrum at small scales enhances the abundance of massive halos while sharply reducing the number of small-mass halos, and consequently, satellite galaxies. Moreover, this modification increases the frequency of major mergers while suppressing high-mass-ratio minor mergers. These features may offer resolutions to the missing satellite and Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problems. In underdense regions -- voids -- the same modifications increase the likelihood of finding massive halos embedded in voids while similarly decreasing the small-halo population, and consequently, faint galaxies. This behavior suggests a potential solution to the void phenomenon, in which embedded halos, despite being too massive, were too rare to be noticed. More precisely, our results indicate that an excess of massive structures emerges at mass scales near the center of the Gaussian bump: $k_* = 1.85 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$ and $k_* = 3.95 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$. These scales correspond to mass scales of $M_* = 10^{11}$ and $M_* = 10^{10}$, respectively. This modification extends up to two orders of magnitude in higher mass scales, while reducing the abundance of halos below $M_*$ by two to three orders of magnitude. Additionally, we find that evolutionary conditions, halo-in-halo, and particularly halo-in-void statistics serve as more sensitive and complementary probes for differentiating among cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from a Different Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative way of analysing Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements via rotations to define new quantities Dperp and Dpar. These quantities allow simple tests of consistency with the Planck LCDM cosmology. The parameter Dperp is determined with negligible uncertainty from Planck under the assumption of LCDM. Comparing with measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find that the measurements of Dperp from Data Release 2 (DR2) move into significantly better agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology compared to DESI Data Release 1 (DR1). The quantity in the orthogonal direction Dpar provides a measure of the physical matter density omega_m in the LCDM cosmology. The DR2 measurements of Dpar\ also come into better agreement with Planck LCDM compared to the earlier DR1 results. From the comparison of Planck and DESI BAO measurements, we find no significant evidence in support of evolving dark energy. We also investigate a rotation in the theory space of the w_0 and w_a parameterization of the dark energy equation-of-state w(z). We show that the combination of DESI BAO measurements and the CMB constrain w(z=0.5) = -0.996 pm 0.046, i.e. very close to the value expected for a cosmological constant. We present a critique of the statistical methodology employed by the DESI collaboration and argue that it gives a misleading impression of the evidence in favour of evolving dark energy. An Appendix shows that the cosmological parameters determined from the Dark Energy Survey 5 Year supernova sample are in tension with those from
  DESI DR2 and parameters determined by Planck.</description>

      <title>Impact of anisotropic photon emission from sources during the epoch of reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reionisation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) was driven by the first stars, galaxies, and accreting black holes. However, the relative importance of these sources and the efficiency by which ionising photons escape into the IGM remain poorly understood. Most reionisation modelling frameworks assume idealised, isotropic emissions. We investigate this assumption by examining a suite of simulations incorporating directed, anisotropic photon emissions. We find that such anisotropic emissions of ionising photons yield a different reionisation geometry compared to the standard, isotropic, case. During the early stages of reionisation (when less than 30 per cent of the Universe is ionised), simulations with narrow photon leakage channels produce smaller ionised bubbles on average. However, these bubbles grow to similar sizes during the middle stages of reionisation. This anisotropy not only produces a distinctive evolution of the size distribution of the ionised regions, but also imprints a feature onto the spherically averaged power spectra of the 21-cm signal throughout reionisation. We observe a suppression in power by about 10-40 per cent at scales corresponding to wavenumbers $k = 0.1-1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to the range in which current radio interferometers are most likely to measure the power spectrum. The simulation with the narrowest channel of ionisation emission shows the strongest suppression. However, this anisotropic emission process does not introduce any measurable anisotropy in the 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>DUCA: Dynamic Universe Cosmological Analysis. II. The impact of clustering dark energy on the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of cosmology, and the halo mass function (HMF) serves as a fundamental tool for extracting cosmological information. Previous calibrations of the HMF in dynamical dark energy (DE) models either assumed a homogeneous DE component or a fixed sound speed of unity, which strongly suppresses DE perturbations. We extend the HMF calibration to clustering dark energy (CDE) models by allowing for a sound speed $(c_{\rm s})$ value different than unity. This generalization enables a broader description of the impact of DE perturbations on structure formation. Our approach builds upon the DUCA simulation suite that accounts for DE at the background and perturbative levels. We present an HMF calibration based on introducing an effective peak height while maintaining the multiplicity function as previously calibrated. The effective peak height is written as a function of the peak height computed using the matter power spectrum of the homogeneous DE case, but it is modulated by the amplitude of DE and matter perturbations on the non-homogeneous case at the turnaround. The model depends on one single parameter, which we calibrate using $N$-body simulations, following a Bayesian approach. The resulting HMF model achieves sub-percent accuracy over a wide range of $c_{\rm s}$ values. Our analysis reveals that, although the overall impact of CDE on halo abundances remains modest (typically a few percent), the effects are more pronounced in non-phantom DE scenarios. Our model qualitatively agrees with predictions based on the spherical collapse model, but predicts a significantly lower impact for low $c_{\rm s}$. Our results underscore the need for more precise modeling of CDE's nonlinear regime. Numerical simulations and theoretical approaches must be advanced to capture the complex interplay between DE perturbations and matter fully.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Inflationary Gravitational Waves with Two Years of SPT-3G Data</title>

Abstract: We present a measurement of the $B$-mode polarization power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies at 32 $\le$ $\ell$ $&lt;$ 502 for three bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz using data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope. This work uses SPT-3G observations from the 2019 and 2020 winter observing seasons of a $\sim$1500 deg$^2$ patch of sky that directly overlaps with fields observed with the BICEP/Keck family of telescopes, and covers part of the proposed Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 deep fields. Employing new techniques for mitigating polarized atmospheric noise, the SPT-3G data demonstrates a white noise level of 9.3 (6.7) $\mu$K-arcmin at $\ell \sim 500$ for the 95 GHz (150 GHz) data, with a $1/\ell$ noise knee at $\ell$=128 (182). We fit the observed six auto- and cross-frequency $B$-mode power spectra to a model including lensed $\Lambda$CDM $B$-modes and a combination of Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. This work characterizes foregrounds in the vicinity of the BICEP/Keck survey area, finding foreground power consistent with that reported by the BICEP/Keck collaboration within the same region, and a factor of $\sim$ 3 higher power over the full SPT-3G survey area. Using SPT-3G data over the BICEP/Keck survey area, we place a 95% upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r &lt; 0.25$ and find the statistical uncertainty on $r$ to be $\sigma(r) = 0.067$.</description>

      <title>Photo- and Hadrodisintegration constraints on massive relics decaying into neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the cosmological constraints on the decay of a relic particle $\phi$ into neutrinos, $\phi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu}$, in particular those arising from the observed light-element abundances in the early Universe. We focus on the late-time disintegration of the light elements previously synthesised during BBN. Several processes are relevant, including final-state radiation associated with the decay, as well as subsequent interactions of the injected neutrinos with the thermal background neutrinos or between themselves. All processes generically contribute to the production of electromagnetic and often also hadronic material and may therefore induce late-time photodisintegration and hadrodisintegration reactions, i.e.~the destruction of light elements that have previously been formed during BBN. Here, we examine this scenario with a Monte-Carlo inspired probabilistic approach rather than Boltzmann techniques, taking into account all of these different reactions as well as their interplay. We find the resulting constraints to be very significant, covering a broad range of previously unexplored masses and lifetimes of the relic source particle.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Dark Core: Helioseismic and neutrino flux constraints on a compact solar center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As dark matter appears to comprise most of the Galactic mass, some of it may accumulate in the cores of stars, thereby making the Sun a laboratory for constraining various dark matter theories. We consider the effects on the solar structure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates that include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We calibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the mass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with variable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-2}~\rm{M}_\odot$ and assess their properties.
  We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux measurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at least $\sim 1\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations impose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\sim 10^{-5}~\rm{M}_\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\rm{M}_\odot$ dark core appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We nevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in the solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may instead be emulating. Finally, we show that future measurements of solar $g$~modes may constrain dark core masses down to $10^{-7}~\rm{M}_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Using Active Learning to Improve Quasar Identification for the DESI Spectra Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey uses an automatic spectral classification pipeline to classify spectra. QuasarNET is a convolutional neural network used as part of this pipeline originally trained using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper we implement an active learning algorithm to optimally select spectra to use for training a new version of the QuasarNET weights file using only DESI data, specifically to improve classification accuracy. This active learning algorithm includes a novel outlier rejection step using a Self-Organizing Map to ensure we label spectra representative of the larger quasar sample observed in DESI. We perform two iterations of the active learning pipeline, assembling a final dataset of 5600 labeled spectra, a small subset of the approx 1.3 million quasar targets in DESI's Data Release 1. When splitting the spectra into training and validation subsets we meet or exceed the previously trained weights file in completeness and purity calculated on the validation dataset with less than one tenth of the amount of training data. The new weights also more consistently classify objects in the same way when used on unlabeled data compared to the old weights file. In the process of improving QuasarNET's classification accuracy we discovered a systemic error in QuasarNET's redshift estimation and used our findings to improve our understanding of QuasarNET's redshifts.</description>

      <title>High optical to X-ray polarization ratio reveals Compton scattering in BL Lacertae's jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars, supermassive black hole systems (SMBHs) with highly relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight, are the most powerful long-lived emitters of electromagnetic emission in the Universe. We report here on a radio to gamma-ray multiwavelength campaign on the blazar BL Lacertae with unprecedented polarimetric coverage from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The observations caught an extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear polarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%. In stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the X-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less than 7.4% (3sigma confidence level). We argue here that this observational result rules out a hadronic origin of the high energy emission, and strongly favors a leptonic (Compton scattering) origin, thereby breaking the degeneracy between hadronic and leptonic emission models for BL Lacertae and demonstrating the power of multiwavelength polarimetry to address this question. Furthermore, the multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely prominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for the first time by the relaxation of a magnetic "spring" embedded in the newly injected plasma. This suggests that the plasma jet can maintain a predominant toroidal magnetic field component parsecs away from the central engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilized the Edelson and Malkan (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) selection techniques and other methods to identify AGN candidates that were monitored during the Kepler prime and K2 missions. Subsequent to those observations, we obtained 125 long-slit optical spectra with the Lick 3-m telescope, 58 spectra with the Palomar 5-m telescope, and three with the Keck 10-m telescope to test these identifications. Of these 186 AGN candidates, 105 were confirmed as Type 1 AGN and 35 as Type 2 AGN, while the remaining 46 were found to have other identifications (e.g., stars and normal galaxies). This indicated an overall reliability of about 75%, while the two main methods had much higher reliability, 87%-96%. The spectra indicated redshifts out to z = 3.4. Then, we examined the AGN sample properties through the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich diagram and compared the AGN's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with those from the literature. We found that our sample yielded the same AGN population as those identified through other methods, such as optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The Simplest Dark Matter Model at the Edge of Perturbativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly sensitive direct detection dark matter experiments are testing important regions of parameter space for WIMP dark matter and pushing many models to the multi-TeV regime. This brings into question the perturbativity of these models. In this context, and in light of the new limits from the LZ experiment, we investigate the status of the simplest thermal dark matter model: a singlet scalar, real or complex, coupled to the Higgs boson. We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the direct detection rates as well as for the annihilations driving thermal freeze-out. For the complex case, we find that the entire perturbative region is excluded by direct detection. For the real case we find that the mass should be $\gtrsim 20\,{\rm TeV}$ at NLO, compared with the $\gtrsim 30\,{\rm TeV}$ LO limit. We highlight that a three-fold improvement on WIMP spin independent interactions can fully test the real scalar model in the perturbative regime. Finally, for both models, there is still an allowed (albeit narrow) region near the Higgs resonance where couplings are perturbative.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between pair-created universes bridged by a wormhole and its implications to big bang cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks Euclidean wormhole as a bridge, we investigate the power spectrum and the entanglement between two pair-created universes. We construct a suitable global vacuum for the perturbations of the inflaton field in the Euclidean regime, which becomes a mixed state when restricted to one of the paired universes. This mixed state leads to an enhancement of the power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. In addition, entanglement between the two universes is realized by the existence of the wormhole. Thus, the power spectrum enhancement in the long-wavelength regime might be evidence of our universe being created from a Euclidean wormhole that was entangled with a partner universe, and hence our universe does not begin with a pure state.</description>

      <title>SIMPLE: Simple Intensity Map Producer for Line Emission</title>

Abstract: We present the Simple Intensity Map Producer for Line Emission (SIMPLE), a public code for quickly simulating mock line-intensity maps, and an analytical framework for modeling intensity maps including observational effects. SIMPLE can be applied to any spectral line sourced by galaxies. The SIMPLE code is based on lognormal mock catalogs of galaxies including positions and velocities and assigns luminosities following the luminosity function. After applying a selection function to distinguish between detected and undetected galaxies, the code generates an intensity map, which can be modified with anisotropic smoothing, noise, a mask, and sky subtraction, and calculates the power spectrum multipoles. We show that the intensity autopower spectrum and the galaxy-intensity cross-power spectrum agree well with the analytical estimates in real space. We derive and show that the sky subtraction suppresses the intensity autopower spectrum and the cross-power spectrum on scales larger than the size of an individual observation. As an example application, we make forecasts for the sensitivity of an intensity mapping experiment similar to the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) to the cross-power spectrum of Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies and the Ly$\alpha$ intensity. We predict that HETDEX will detect the galaxy-intensity cross-power spectrum on scales of $0.04\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 1\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lagrangian bias estimators and the cumulant bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxies is a highly complex phenomenon currently impossible to predict deterministically. However, by using a statistical $\textit{bias}$ relation, it becomes possible to robustly model the average abundance of galaxies as a function of the underlying matter density field. Understanding the properties and parametric description of the bias relation is key to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys. Here, we contribute to this topic primarily in two ways: (1) We develop a new set of probabilistic estimators for bias parameters using the moments of the Lagrangian galaxy environment distribution. These estimators include spatial corrections at different orders to measure bias parameters independently of the damping scale. We report robust measurements of a variety of bias parameters for haloes, including the tidal bias and its dependence with spin at a fixed mass. (2) We propose an alternative formulation of the bias expansion in terms of "cumulant bias parameters" that describe the response of the logarithmic galaxy density to large-scale perturbations. We find that cumulant biases of haloes are consistent with zero at orders $n &gt; 2$. This suggests that: (i) previously reported bias relations at order $n &gt; 2$ are an artefact of the entangled basis of the canonical bias expansion; (ii) the convergence of the bias expansion may be improved by phrasing it in terms of cumulants; (iii) the bias function is very well approximated by a Gaussian -- an avenue which we explore in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model where early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field {\it i.e.}, two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential, which is chosen phenomenologically. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. But, at the perturbation level the potential shows significant difference with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. Even after the presence of required EDE solution in all four potentials we don't get any significant improvement in the value of $H_0$. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also see that the data prefers $\Lambda$CDM model over the considered scalar field models at least for the data combinations with Pantheon$+$ and Union3.</description>

      <title>Redshift evolution of the X-ray and UV luminosity relation of quasars: calibrated results from SNe Ia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars could serve as standard candles if the relation between their ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities can be accurately calibrated. Previously, we developed a model-independent method to calibrate quasar standard candles using the distances-redshift relation reconstructed from Type Ia supernova at z&lt;2 using Gaussian process regression. Interestingly, we found that the calibrated quasar standard candle dataset preferred a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts above z&gt;2. One interpretation of these findings is that the calibration parameters of the quasar UV-X-ray luminosity relationship evolves with redshift. In order to test the redshift dependence of the quasar calibration in a model-independent manner, we divided the quasar sample whose redshift overlap with the redshift coverage of Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation into two sub-samples: a low-redshift quasar sub-sample and a high-redshift quasar sub-sample. Our present results show that there is about a 4$\sigma$ inconsistency between the quasar parameters inferred from the high-redshift quasar sub-sample and from the low-redshift sub-sample if no evolution of the quasar relation is considered. This inconsistency suggests the necessity of considering redshift evolution for the relationship between the quasars$'$ ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities. We then test an explicit parametrization of the redshift evolution of the quasar calibration parameters via $\gamma(z) = \gamma_0+\gamma_1(1+z)$ and $\beta(z)=\beta_0+\beta_1(1+z)$. Combining this redshift-dependent calibration relationship with the distance-redshift relationship reconstructed from Pantheon+ supernova compilation, we find the high-redshift sub-sample and low-redshift sub-sample become consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level, which means that the parameterized form of $\gamma(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ works well at describing the evolution of the quasar calibration parameters.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for Large Scale Structure (LSS) perturbation theory, that solves the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for the distribution function in full phase space. This approach relaxes the usual apriori assumption of negligible velocity dispersion underlying the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT). We apply the new method to rederive the usual SPT kernels up to third order in the perturbative expansion. We also show that a counterterm, identical to the one introduced by standard Effective Field Theory (EFT) methods, naturally arises within our framework. We finish by making a precise connection to EFT techniques, which reveals the necessity of the EFTofLSS to self-consistently model the long-wavelength fluid, and illustrates the importance of having theoretical control over short distance fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>

Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <title>PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, characterized by discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant from early and late universe probes, remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. Building upon our previous analysis of individual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of simultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at specific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in Cepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$), metallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our comprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of approximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most statistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$, and $M_B$, yielding $\Delta \text{AIC} \simeq -9.2$ and $\Delta \text{BIC} \simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong evidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate that the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with CMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that alleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be resolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities rather than requiring new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A forest of gravitational waves in our Galactic Centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the Galactic Centre, we can expect a population of a few tens of early extreme-mass ratio inspirals (E-EMRIs) and extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). Depending on their evolutionary stage, they can be highly eccentric, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens or hundreds, or nearly circular, with SNRs as large as a few thousand. Their individual signals combine into a common signal, which can complicate the resolution of other types of sources. We have calculated the foreground signal of continuous E-EMRIs and XMRIs using a catalog based on the expected number of sources and a realistic phase-space distribution. The forest of E-EMRIs will cover a large portion of the LISA sensitivity curve, obscuring the signals of some massive black hole binaries, verification binaries, and harmonics of EMRIs in their polychromatic phase. The combined signal from XMRIs will be much weaker but still affect intermediate-mass black hole binaries. Due to the large SNR, this forest can be also found in other galactic nuclei, such as that of the Andromeda galaxy. Even under conservative assumptions, the forest created by E-EMRIs and XMRIs in our Galactic Centre will likely pose a challenge for resolving other types of sources, as their contribution is non-coherent and exhibits large SNRs.</description>

      <title>Differences in baryonic and dark matter scaling relations of galaxy clusters: A comparison between IllustrisTNG simulations and observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the self-similar baryonic mass fraction scaling relations between galaxy clusters from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey and the IllustrisTNG state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Using samples of 218 (TNG100) and 1605 (TNG300) friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes within $0.0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ and $M_{200c} \geq 7 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, we fit the scaling relations using Simple Power Law (SPL), Broken Power Law (BPL), and General Double Power Law (GDPL) models through non-linear least squares regression. The SPL model reveals null slopes for the baryonic fraction as a function of redshift, consistent with self-similarity. Observations and simulations agree within $1{-}2\sigma$, suggesting comparable baryonic scaling slopes. We identify $\sim$13.8$-$14.1 per cent of baryons as "missing", primarily in the form of intracluster light (ICL) across all halo masses and warm gas in low-mass haloes. High-mass haloes ($\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \geq 14$) adhere to self-similarity, while low-mass haloes exhibit deviations, with the breakpoint occurring at $\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \sim 14$, where baryons are redistributed to the outskirts. Our findings suggest that the undetected warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and baryon redistribution by feedback mechanisms are complementary solutions to the "missing baryon" problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

Abstract: We derive new approximations for quintessence solutions that are simpler and an order of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature, which from an observational perspective \emph{makes numerical calculations superfluous}. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation yields $\sim 0.1\%$ maximum relative errors of $H(z)/H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}(z)$ for the observationally viable inverse power law scalar field potentials, and similarly for viable thawing quintessence models using two slow-roll parameters. The approximations are trivially computed from the scalar field potential and as an application we give \emph{analytic} expressions for the CPL parameters calculated from an arbitrary scalar field potential for thawing and tracking quintessence models.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we present a systematic search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflow features using \textit{JWST} medium-band images in the GOODS-S field. This is done by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 8.4$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By fitting their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 50\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.</description>

      <title>SMILES: Potentially Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$. We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2$ using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H$\alpha$ coverage, spanning $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1$. The galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$, is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H$\alpha$ coverage, we find that $\log\xi_{\rm ion}$ is positively correlated with $\log(1+\delta)$, with a slope of $0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}$. Additionally, the mean $\xi_{\rm ion}$ for galaxies in overdense regions ($\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1$) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions ($\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1$). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that low-mass primordial black holes cannot constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in our universe due to their predicted short lifetimes from the conventional Hawking radiation and evaporation process. Assuming physical black holes are nonsingular--likely due to quantum gravity or other high-energy physics--we demonstrate that a large class of nonsingular black holes have finite evaporation temperatures. This can lead to slowly evaporating low-mass black holes or to remnant mass states that circumvent traditional evaporation constraints. As a proof of concept, we explore the limiting curvature hypothesis and the evaporation process of a nonsingular black hole solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We identify generic features of the radiation profile and compare them with known regular black holes, such as the Bardeen solution in four dimensions. Remnant masses are proportional to the fundamental length scale, and we argue that slowly evaporating low-mass nonsingular black holes, or remnants, are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state, $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found that the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent bound of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas 1-$\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$. These bounds however depend on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables. We have further utilized the predictions from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD in order to obtain bounds on the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us constrain the model parameters further. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity wave signal by these CMB missions may rule out Mukhanov parametrization.</description>

      <title>The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z&lt;1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Our analysis shows that majority of the main progenitor branches of the present-day GV galaxies entered the green valley at $z&lt;1$. We also find that a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the main progenitor branches had already crossed the green valley and joined the red sequence by $z=0.1$, indicating that some galaxies may undergo late-time rejuvenation, that allows them to reenter the green valley by the present day. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of vacuum energy compensation due to interaction of a scalar field $\phi$ with curvature scalar of the form $\beta R \phi^2 f(\phi) $ is proposed. It is shown that with a simple power form of $f(\phi)$ the exponential expansion, induced by vacuum energy (or what is the same by cosmological constant), is transformed into canonical cosmological evolution of the universe dominated by relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>Luminosity and stellar mass functions of faint photometric satellites around spectroscopic central galaxies from DESI Year-1 Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>
