      <title>Hybrid-Field 6D Movable Antenna for Terahertz Communications: Channel Modeling and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs.
  Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Secrecy Rate and Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for RIS-Aided VLC Systems: RSMA Versus NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Channel Estimation for Fluid Antenna Systems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains -- particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in high-dimensional FAS.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Time-Frequency Phase-Shifted Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach (IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs, the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Precoding for Near-Field Secure Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios. Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-enabled Secure Semantic Communication Against Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, AN is introduced into semantic communication systems for the first time to prevent semantic eavesdropping. However, the introduction of AN also poses challenges for the legitimate receiver in extracting semantic information. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have demonstrated their powerful capabilities in generating multimedia content. Here, the paired pluggable modules are carefully designed using DDPM. Specifically, the pluggable encryption module generates AN and adds it to the output of the semantic transmitter, while the pluggable decryption module before semantic receiver uses DDPM to generate the detailed semantic information by removing both AN and the channel noise. In the scenario where the transmitter lacks eavesdropper's knowledge, the artificial Gaussian noise (AGN) is used as AN. We first model a power allocation optimization problem to determine the power of AGN, in which the objective is to minimize the weighted sum of data reconstruction error of legal link, the mutual information of illegal link, and the channel input distortion. Then, a deep reinforcement learning framework using deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In the scenario where the transmitter is aware of the eavesdropper's knowledge, we propose an AN generation method based on adversarial residual networks (ARN). Unlike the previous scenario, the mutual information term in the objective function is replaced by the confidence of eavesdropper correctly
  retrieving private information. The adversarial residual network is then trained to minimize the modified objective function. The simulation results show that the diffusion-enabled pluggable encryption module prevents semantic eavesdropping while the pluggable decryption module achieves the high-quality semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $k$-hash distances and rates of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k \leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds on the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler proof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov and by Bishnoi D'haeseleeer and Gijswijt. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>Computational Irreducibility as the Foundation of Agency: A Formal Model Connecting Undecidability to Autonomous Behavior in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a "minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments. Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction, offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI, and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally irreducible universe.</description>

      <title>Statistical CSI Acquisition for Multi-frequency Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR) method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while effectively reducing system overhead.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Balancing Client Participation in Federated Learning Using AoI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients. However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$ and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning environments.</description>

      <title>Testing Message-Passing Concurrency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key computational question underpinning the automated testing and verification of concurrent programs is the \emph{consistency question} -- \emph{given a partial execution history, can it be completed in a consistent manner?} Due to its importance, consistency testing has been studied extensively for memory models, as well as for database isolation levels. A common theme in all these settings is the use of shared-memory as the primal mode of interthread communication. On the other hand, modern programming languages, such as Go, Rust and Kotlin, advocate a paradigm shift towards channel-based (i.e., message-passing) communication. However, the consistency question for channel-based concurrency is currently poorly understood.
  In this paper we lift the study of fundamental consistency problems to channels, taking into account various input parameters, such as the number of threads executing, the number of channels, and the channel capacities. We draw a rich complexity landscape, including upper bounds that become polynomial when certain input parameters are fixed, as well as hardness lower bounds. Our upper bounds are based on novel algorithms that can drive the verification of channel consistency in automated verification tools. Our lower bounds characterize minimal input parameters that are sufficient for hardness to arise, and thus shed light on the intricacies of testing channel-based concurrency. In combination, our upper and lower bounds characterize the boundary of \emph{tractability/intractability} of verifying channel consistency, and imply that our algorithms are often (nearly) optimal.</description>

Abstract: Arbitrary matrices $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, randomly perturbed in an additive manner using a random matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, are shown to asymptotically almost surely satisfy the so-called {\sl robust null space property} whilst asymptotically meeting the optimal number of measurements required for {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms. A wide range of random perturbation matrices is considered; in that, $R$ is allowed to be sub-gaussian, sub-exponential, as well as extremely heavy-tailed, where only the first $\log n$ moments of each entry of $R$ are bounded. A key tool driving our proofs is {\sl Mendelson's small-ball method} ({\em Learning without concentration}, J. ACM, Vol. $62$, $2015$).</description>

      <title>A Connection Between Learning to Reject and Bhattacharyya Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</description>

      <title>New construction of Locally Perfect Nonlinear Functions with Application to Sequences Sets with Low Ambiguity Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Ambiguity Zone (LAZ) sequences play a pivotal role in modern integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Recently, Wang et al.\cite{WangZhou2025} proposed a definition of locally perfect nonlinear functions (LPNFs) and constructed three classes of both periodic and aperiodic LAZ sequence sets with flexible parameters by applying such functions and interleaving method. Some of these LAZ sequence sets are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Ye-Zhou-Liu-Fan-Lei-Tang bounds under certain conditions. In this paper, we proceed with the constructions of the three new classes of LPNFs with new parameters. By using these LPNFs, we also present a series of LAZ sequence sets with more flexible parameters, addressing the limitations of existing parameter choices. Furthermore, our results show that one of these classes is asymptotically optimal in both the periodic and aperiodic cases, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna for 6G Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings \((a, b, c)\), there exists a string \(z\) such that each of the values of conditional Kolmogorov complexity \(C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)\) is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We provide a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple \((a, b, c)\) for which no such string \(z\) exists. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on recent bounds on point-line incidences over prime fields. As an application, we show that this impossibility implies lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in the information-theoretic behavior of projective planes over fields with and without proper subfields.</description>

Abstract: We present several algorithms to generate tables for asymmetric numeral systems and prove that they are optimal in terms of discrepancy. In turn, this gives rise to the strongest proven bound on entropy loss. We further give improved theoretical bounds for the entropy loss in tabled asymmetric numeral systems and a brief empirical evaluation of the stream variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar codes with large kernels achieve optimal error exponents but are difficult to construct when low decoding complexity is also required. We address this challenge under recursive maximum likelihood decoding (RMLD) using a rein-forcement learning approach based on the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm. The resulting method, PolarZero, consistently matches exhaustive search in identifying low-complexity kernels, and discovers a size-16 kernel with complexity comparable to handcrafted designs. Our results suggest that PolarZero is a scalable tool for large-kernel design, where brute-force search is no longer feasible.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit an exceptional capacity for generalization in practical applications. This work aims to capture the effect and benefits of depth for supervised learning via information-theoretic generalization bounds. We first derive two hierarchical bounds on the generalization error in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the 1-Wasserstein distance between the train and test distributions of the network internal representations. The KL divergence bound shrinks as the layer index increases, while the Wasserstein bound implies the existence of a layer that serves as a generalization funnel, which attains a minimal 1-Wasserstein distance. Analytic expressions for both bounds are derived under the setting of binary Gaussian classification with linear DNNs. To quantify the contraction of the relevant information measures when moving deeper into the network, we analyze the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) coefficient between consecutive layers of three regularized DNN models: $\mathsf{Dropout}$, $\mathsf{DropConnect}$, and Gaussian noise injection. This enables refining our generalization bounds to capture the contraction as a function of the network architecture parameters. Specializing our results to DNNs with a finite parameter space and the Gibbs algorithm reveals that deeper yet narrower network architectures generalize better in those examples, although how broadly this statement applies remains a question.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rate Control for Deep Video Compression with Rate-Distortion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep video compression has made significant progress in recent years, achieving rate-distortion performance that surpasses that of traditional video compression methods. However, rate control schemes tailored for deep video compression have not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based $\lambda$-domain rate control scheme for deep video compression, which determines the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each to-be-coded frame based on the rate-distortion-$\lambda$ (R-D-$\lambda$) relationships directly learned from uncompressed frames, achieving high rate control accuracy efficiently without the need for pre-encoding. Moreover, this content-aware scheme is able to mitigate inter-frame quality fluctuations and adapt to abrupt changes in video content. Specifically, we introduce two neural network-based predictors to estimate the relationship between bitrate and $\lambda$, as well as the relationship between distortion and $\lambda$ for each frame. Then we determine the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each frame to achieve the target bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high rate control accuracy at the mini-GOP level with low time overhead and mitigates inter-frame quality fluctuations across video content of varying resolutions.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing: A Robust Method for Quantum Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections. This work contributes a valuable tool to the field of Quantum Information Science.</description>

      <title>Invariant Bridges Between Four Successive Points: A New Tool for Data Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet powerful invariant relation connecting four successive terms of a class of exponentially decaying alternating functions. Specifically, for the sequence defined by f(n) = ((1/2)^n + (-1)^n) / n, we prove that the combination [(n-2)f(n-2) + (n-3)f(n-3)] / [n f(n) + (n-1)f(n-1)] is universally equal to 4 for all integers n &gt;= 4. This invariant bridge across four points opens new possibilities for predictive coding, data compression, and error detection. We demonstrate how the relation can be used to reconstruct missing data, verify data integrity, and reduce redundancy in data streams with minimal computational overhead. The simplicity and universality of this invariant make it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in information theory and coding systems.</description>
