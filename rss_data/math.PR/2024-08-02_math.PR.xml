      <title>Littlewood-Offord problems for the Curie-Weiss models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Littlewood-Offord problems in one dimension for the Curie-Weiss models. To be more precise, we are interested in \[Q_n^{+}:=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\sup_{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\geq 1}P(\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\varepsilon_i\in(x-1,x+1)),\] \[Q_n=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\sup_{|v_1|,|v_2|,\ldots,|v_n|\geq 1}P(\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\varepsilon_i\in(x-1,x+1))\] where the random variables $(\varepsilon_i)_{i=1,2,\ldots,n}$ are spins in Curie-Weiss models. This is a generalization of classical Littlewood-Offord problems from Rademacher random variables to possibly dependent random variables. In particular, it includes the case of general i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. We calculate the asymptotics of $Q_n^{+}$ and $Q_n$ as $n\to\infty$ and observe the phenomena of phase transitions. Besides, we prove that the supremum in the definition of $Q_n^{+}$ is attained when $v_1=v_2=\cdots=v_n=1$. When $n$ is even, the supremum in the definition of $Q_n$ is attained when one half of $(v_i)_i$ equals to $1$ and the other half equals to $-1$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Domination of Exit Times for Random Walks and Brownian Motion with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, by an elementary use of Girsanov's transform we show that the exit time for either a biased random walk or a drifted Brownian motion on a symmetric interval is stochastically monotone with respect to the drift parameter. In the random walk case, this gives an alternative proof of a recent result of E. Pek\"oz and R. Righter in 2024. Our arguments in both discrete and continuous cases are parallel to each other. We also outline a simple SDE proof for the Brownian case based on a standard comparison theorem.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the maximum of a reducible two-type branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion, defined as a particle system on the real line in which particles of two types move according to independent Brownian motions and create offspring at a constant rate. Particles of type $1$ can give birth to particles of types $1$ and $2$, but particles of type $2$ only give birth to descendants of type $2$. Under some specific conditions, Belloum and Mallein in \cite{BeMa21} show that the maximum position $M_t$ of all particles alive at time $t$, suitably centred by a deterministic function $m_t$, converge weakly. In this work, we are interested in the decay rate of the following upper large deviation probability, as $t\rightarrow\infty$, \[ {\mathbb P}(M_t\geq \theta m_t),\quad \theta&gt;1. \] We shall show that the decay rate function exhibits phase transitions depending on certain relations between $\theta$, the variance of the underling Brownian motion and the branching rate.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for free multiplicative Brownian motions via spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After some normalization, the logarithms of the ordered singular values of Brownian motions on $GL(N,\mathbb F)$ with $\mathbb F=\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ form Weyl-group invariant Heckman-Opdam processes on $\mathbb R^N$ of type $A_{N-1}$. We use classical elementary formulas for the spherical functions of $GL(N,\mathbb C)/SU(N)$ and the associated Euclidean spaces $H(N,\mathbb C)$ of Hermitian matrices, and show that in the $GL(N,\mathbb C)$-case, these processes can be also interpreted as ordered eigenvalues of Brownian motions on $H(N,\mathbb C)$ with particular drifts. This leads to an explicit description for the free limits for the associated empirical processes for $N\to\infty$ where these limits are independent from the parameter $k$ of the Heckman-Opdam processes. In particular we get new formulas for the distributions of the free multiplicative Browniam motion of Biane. We also show how this approach works for the root systems $B_N, C_N, D_N$.</description>

      <title>Outliers and bounded rank perturbation for non-Hermitian random band matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider general non-Hermitian square random matrices $X$ that include a wide class of random band matrices with independent entries. Whereas the existence of limiting density is largely unknown for these inhomogeneous models, we show that spectral outliers can be determined under very general conditions when perturbed by a finite rank deterministic matrix. More precisely, we show that whenever $\mathbb{E}[X]=0,\mathbb{E}[XX^*]=\mathbb{E}[X^*X]=\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbb{E}[X^2]=\rho\mathbf{1}$, and under mild conditions on sparsity and entry moments of $X$, then with high possibility all eigenvalues of $X$ are confined in a neighborhood of the support of the elliptic law with parameter $\rho$. Also, a finite rank perturbation property holds: when $X$ is perturbed by another deterministic matrix $C_N$ with bounded rank, then the perturbation induces outlying eigenvalues whose limit depends only on outlying eigenvalues of $C_N$ and $\rho$. This extends the result of Tao on i.i.d. random matrices and O'rourke and Renfrew on elliptic matrices to a family of highly sparse and inhomogeneous random matrices, including all Gaussian band matrices on regular graphs with degree at least $(\log N)^3$. A quantitative convergence rate is also derived. We also consider a class of finite rank deformations of products of at least two independent elliptic random matrices, and show it behaves just as product i.i.d. matrices.</description>

      <title>Loop percolation versus link percolation in the random loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Muhl2019], Peter M\"uhlbacher showed that in the random loop model without loop weights, a loop phase transition (assuming it exists) cannot occur at the same parameter as the percolation phase transition of the occupied edges. In this work, we give a quantitative version of this result, specifying a minimal gap between the percolation phase transition and a possible loop phase transition. A substantial part of our argument also works for weighted loop models.</description>

      <title>ISDE with logarithmic interaction and characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider certain random matrix eigenvalue dynamics, akin to Dyson Brownian motion, introduced by Rider and Valko. We show that from every initial condition, including ones involving coinciding coordinates, the dynamics, enhanced with more information, converge on path-space to an infinite-dimensional Feller-continuous diffusion process. We show that the limiting diffusion solves an infinite-dimensional system of stochastic differential equations (ISDE) with logarithmic interaction. Moreover, we show convergence in the long-time limit of the infinite-dimensional dynamics starting from any initial condition to the equilibrium measure, given by the inverse points of the Bessel determinantal point process. As far as we can tell, this is: (a) the first path-space convergence result of random matrix dynamics starting from every initial condition to an infinite-dimensional Feller diffusion, (b) the first construction of solutions to an ISDE with logarithmic interaction from every initial condition for which the singular drift term can be defined at time $0$, (c) the first convergence to equilibrium result from every initial condition for an ISDE of this kind. The argument splits into two parts. The first part builds on the method of intertwiners introduced and developed by Borodin and Olshanski. The main new ingredients are a uniform, in a certain sense, approximation theorem of the spectrum of a family of random matrices indexed by an infinite-dimensional space and an extension of the method of intertwiners to deal with convergence to equilibrium. The second part introduces a new approach towards convergence of the singular drift term in the dynamics and for showing non-intersection of the limiting paths via certain ``characteristic polynomials" associated to the process. We believe variations of it will be applicable to other infinite-dimensional dynamics coming from random matrices.</description>

      <title>Bonus-malus Systems vs Delays in Claims Reporting and Settlement: Analysis of Ruin Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our paper explores a discrete-time risk model with time-varying premiums, investigating two types of correlated claims: main claims and by-claims. Settlement of the by-claims can be delayed for one time period, representing real-world insurance practices. We examine two premium principles based on reported and settled claims, using recursively computable finite-time ruin probabilities to evaluate the performance of time-varying premiums. Our findings suggest that, under specific assumptions, a higher probability of by-claim settlement delays leads to lower ruin probabilities. Moreover, a stronger correlation between main claims and their associated by-claims results in higher ruin probabilities. Lastly, the premium adjustment principles based on settled claims experience contribute to higher ruin probabilities compared to those based on reported claims experience, assuming all other factors remain constant. Notably, this difference becomes more pronounced when there is a high likelihood of by-claim delays.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 1. 3-D Insulating Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of steady-state for $3$-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with insulating boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We use Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to get the global existence of solutions around the steady state. Compared with the deterministic case, due to the stochastic forces, the momentum does not have the temporal derivative, which causes troubles to the energy estimates. We establish the asymptotic stability about the spatial derivatives by the weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from the deterministic case. The existence of invariant measure generated by the solutions to the evolving semiconductor equations is shown from the a priori energy estimates. Furthermore, the invariant measure is exactly the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, in which the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state plays an essential role.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new distribution over the unit interval which can be characterized as a ratio of the type Z=Y/(X+Y) where X and Y are two correlated Birnbaum-Saunders random variables. The stress-strength probability between X and Y is calculated explicitly when the respective scale parameters are equal. Two applications of the ratio distribution are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Lyons Conjecture I: Subgroup Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07]. This conjecture, originated in probability theory, is well known (cf. [Gel18]) to be equivalent to the statement that every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic. We disprove this last statement.
  In this part we introduce subgroup tests. These tests are finite distributions over continuous functions from the space of subgroups of the free group to $\{0,1\}$. Subgroup tests provide a general framework in which one can study invariant random subgroups of the free group. Classical notions such as group soficity and group stability arise naturally in this framework. By the correspondence between subgroups of the free group and Schreier graphs, one can view subgroup tests as a property testing model for certain edge-labeled graphs. This correspondence also provides the connection to random networks.
  Subgroup tests have values, which are their asymptotic optimal expectations when integrated against co-sofic invariant random subgroups. Our first main result is that, if every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic, then one can approximate the value of a subgroup test up to any positive additive constant. Our second main result is an essentially value preserving correspondence between certain non-local games and subgroup tests. By composing this correspondence with a stronger variant of the reduction in MIP*=RE [JNV+21], proved in the companion paper [BCV24], we deduce that approximating the sofic value of a subgroup test is as hard as the Halting Problem, and in particular, undecidable. The combination of our two main results proves the existence of non co-sofic invariant random subgroups of the free group.</description>

      <title>The iterative persuasion-polarization opinion dynamics and its mean-field analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Iterative Persuasion-Polarization (IPP) model to study the dynamics of opinion formation and change within a population. The IPP model integrates mechanisms of persuasion and repulsion, where individuals influence each other through interactions that can either align opinions incrementally or lead to greater divergence. The probability of each interaction type is governed by a parameter $\alpha$, representing the population's receptiveness to persuasion. We investigate how these interaction dynamics shape the long-term distribution of opinions, examining conditions that promote consensus or polarization. By deriving a system of nonlinear and autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we provide a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the distributional behavior of opinions in large populations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of social influence dynamics and their implications in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total variation. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we compute the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for large-scale stochastic systems with non-zero initial states and controlled diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new strategies to reduce the dimension of large-scale controlled stochastic differential equations with non-zero initial states. The first approach transforms the original setting into a stochastic system with zero initial states. This transformation naturally leads to equations with controlled diffusion. A detailed analysis of dominant subspaces and bounds for the reduction error is provided in this controlled diffusion framework. Subsequently, we introduce a reduced system for the original framework and prove an a-priori error bound for the first ansatz. This bound involves so-called Hankel singular values that are linked to a new pair of Gramians. A second strategy is presented that is based on the idea of reducing control and initial state dynamics separately. Here, different Gramians are used in order to derive a reduced model and their relation to dominant subspaces are pointed out. We also show an a posteriori error bound for the second approach involving two types of Hankel singular values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary distributions of multivariate diffusion processes have recently been proposed as probabilistic models of causal systems in statistics and machine learning. Motivated by these developments, we study stationary multivariate diffusion processes with a sparsely structured drift. Our main result gives a characterization of the conditional independence relations that hold in a stationary distribution. The result draws on a graphical representation of the drift structure and pertains to conditional independence relations that hold generally as a consequence of the drift's sparsity pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

Abstract: Over the last years, there has been a significant amount of work studying the power of specific classes of computationally efficient estimators for multiple statistical parametric estimation tasks, including the estimators classes of low-degree polynomials, spectral methods, and others. Despite that, our understanding of the important class of MCMC methods remains quite poorly understood. For instance, for many models of interest, the performance of even zero-temperature (greedy-like) MCMC methods that simply maximize the posterior remains elusive.
  In this work, we provide an easy to check condition under which the low-temperature Metropolis chain maximizes the posterior in polynomial-time with high probability. The result is generally applicable, and in this work, we use it to derive positive MCMC results for two classical sparse estimation tasks: the sparse tensor PCA model and sparse regression. Interestingly, in both cases, we also leverage the Overlap Gap Property framework for inference (Gamarnik, Zadik AoS '22) to prove that our results are tight: no low-temperature local MCMC method can achieve better performance. In particular, our work identifies the "low-temperature (local) MCMC threshold" for both sparse models. Interestingly, in the sparse tensor PCA model our results indicate that low-temperature local MCMC methods significantly underperform compared to other studied time-efficient methods, such as the class of low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>A characterization of equivalent martingale probability measures in a mixed renewal risk model with applications in Risk Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a given aggregate process $S$ is a compound mixed renewal process under a probability measure $P$, we provide a characterization of all probability measures $Q$ on the domain of $P$ such that $Q$ and $P$ are progressively equivalent and $S$ is converted into a compound mixed Poisson process under $Q$. This result extends earlier works of Delbaen &amp; Haezendonck [2], Embrechts &amp; Meister [5], Lyberopoulos &amp; Macheras [11], and of the authors [14]. Implications to the ruin problem and to the computation of premium calculation principles in an insurance market possessing the property of no free lunch with vanishing risk are also discussed.</description>

      <title>New combinatorial identity for the set of partitions and limit theorems in finite free probability theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a refined combinatorial identity for the set of partitions of $\{1,\dots, n\}$, which plays an important role in investigating several limit theorems related to finite free convolutions. Firstly, we present the finite free analogue of Sakuma and Yoshida's limit theorem. That is, we provide the limit of $\{D_{1/m}((p_d^{\boxtimes_d m})^{\boxplus_d m})\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ as $m\rightarrow\infty$ in two cases: (i) $m/d\rightarrow t$ for some $t&gt;0$, or (ii) $m/d\rightarrow0$. The second application presents a central limit theorem for finite free multiplicative convolution. We establish a connection between this theorem and the multiplicative free semicircular distributions through combinatorial identities. Our last result gives alternative proofs for Kabluchko's limit theorems concerning the unitary Hermite and the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Moments of polynomial functionals in Levy-driven queues with secondary jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $J(\cdot)$ be a compound Poisson process with rate $\lambda&gt;0$ and a jumps distribution $G(\cdot)$ concentrated on $(0,\infty)$. In addition, let $V$ be a random variable which is distributed according to $G(\cdot)$ and independent from $J(\cdot)$. Define a new process $W(t)\equiv W_V(t)\equiv V+J(t)-t$, $t\geq0$ and let $\tau_V$ be the first time that $W(\cdot)$ hits the origin. A long-standing open problem due to Iglehart (1971) and Cohen (1979) is to derive the moments of the functional $\int_0^\tau W(t)\,{\rm d}t$ in terms of the moments of $G(\cdot)$ and $\lambda$. In the current work, we solve this problem in much greater generality, i.e., first by letting $J(\cdot)$ belong to a wide class of spectrally-positive L\'evy processes and secondly, by considering more general class of functionals. We also supply several applications of the existing results, e.g., in studying the process $x\mapsto \int_0^{\tau_x}W_x(t)\,{\rm d}t$ defined on $x\in[0,\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that non-doubling metric spaces can be characterized as those that contain arbitrarily large sets of approximately equidistant points and use this to show that, for $\gamma \in (0,2]$, the $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity metric is almost surely not doubling and thus cannot be quasisymmetrically embedded into any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. This generalizes the corresponding result of Troscheit for the Brownian map (which is equivalent to the case $\gamma = \sqrt{8/3}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new approach in the definition of two-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions. Namely, we introduce the classes of two-dimensional long-tailed, of twodimensional dominatedly varying and of two-dimensional consistently varying distributions. Next, we define the closure property with respect to two-dimensional convolution and to joint max-sum equivalence in order to study if they are satisfied by these classes. Further we examine the joint behavior of two random sums, under generalized tail asymptotic independence. Afterward we study the closure property under scalar product and two dimensional product convolution and by these results we extended our main result in the case of jointly randomly weighted sums. Our results contained some applications where we establish the asymptotic expression of the ruin probability in a two-dimensional discrete-time risk model.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Markovian randomized equilibria in Dynkin games of war-of-attrition-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optimal stopping problems, a Markov structure guarantees Markovian optimal stopping times (first exit times). Surprisingly, there is no analogous result for Markovian stopping games once randomization is required. This paper addresses this gap by proving the existence of Markov-perfect equilibria in a specific type of stopping game - a general nonzero-sum Dynkin games of the war-of-attrition type with underlying linear diffusions. Our main mathematical contribution lies in the development of appropriate topologies for Markovian randomized stopping times. This allows us to establish the existence of equilibria within a tractable and interpretable class of stopping times, paving the way for further analysis of Markovian stopping games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cowan and Zabczyk (1978) introduced a continuous-time generalisation of the best-choice (secretary) problem, where offers arrive at epochs of a homogeneous Poisson process. We expand their work to encompass the last-success problem under the Karamata-Stirling success profile. In this setting, the $k$th trial is a success with probability $p_k=\theta/(\theta+k-1)$, where $\theta &gt; 0$. In the best-choice setting ($\theta=1$), the myopic strategy is optimal, and the proof hinges on verifying the monotonicity of certain critical roots. We extend this crucial result to the last-success case by exploiting a connection to the sign of the derivative in the first parameter of a quotient of Kummer's hypergeometric functions. Finally, we derive bounds and asymptotics of the critical roots, strengthening and improving the findings of Ciesielski and Zabczyk (1979).</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on continuous univariate probability distributions, like McKay distributions, $K$-distribution, generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and generalised McKay distributions, with support $[0,\infty),$ which are related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and in most cases we show that they belong to the class infinitely divisible distributions, self-decomposable distributions, generalized gamma convolutions and hyperbolically completely monotone densities. Some of the results are known, however the proofs are new and we use special functions technique. Integral representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions as well as of quotients of Gaussian hypergeometric functions, or modified Bessel functions of the second kind play an important role in our study. In addition, by using a different approach we rediscover a Stieltjes transform representation due to Hermann Hankel for the product of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and we also deduce a series of new Stieltjes transform representations for products, quotients and their reciprocals concerning modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. By using these results we obtain new infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions with Laplace transforms related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. Moreover, we show that the new Stieltjes transform representations have some interesting applications and we list some open problems which may be of interest for further research. In addition, we present a new proof via the Pick function characterization theorem for the infinite divisibility of the ratio of two gamma random variables and we present some new Stieltjes transform representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Random walk on dynamical percolation in Euclidean lattices: separating critical and supercritical regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random walk on dynamical percolation of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., the two-dimensional triangular lattice $\mathcal{T}$), where each edge (resp., each site) can be either open or closed, refreshing its status at rate $\mu\in (0,1/e]$. The random walk moves along open edges in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., open sites in $\mathcal{T}$) at rate $1$. For the critical regime $p=p_c$, we prove the following two results: on $\mathcal{T}$, the mean squared displacement of the random walk from $0$ to $t$ is at most $O(t\mu^{5/132-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$; on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq 11$, the corresponding upper bound for the mean squared displacement is $O(t \mu^{1/2}\log(1/\mu))$. For the supercritical regime $p&gt;p_c$, we prove that the mean squared displacement on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is at least $ct$ for some $c=c(d)&gt;0$ that does not depend on $\mu$.</description>

Abstract: At high temperature, the overlap of two particles chosen independently according to the Gibbs measure of the branching Brownian motion converges to zero as time goes to infinity. We investigate the precise decay rate of the probability to obtain an overlap greater than $a$, for some $a&gt;0$, in the whole subcritical phase of inverse temperatures $\beta \in [0,\beta_c)$. Moreover, we study this probability both conditionally on the branching Brownian motion and non-conditionally. Two sub-phases of inverse temperatures appear, but surprisingly the threshold is not the same in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07217v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the Keller-Segel model coupled to stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (KS-SNS, for short), which describes the dynamics of oxygen and bacteria densities evolving within a stochastically forced 2D incompressible viscous flow. Our main goal is to investigate the existence and uniqueness of global solutions (strong in the probabilistic sense and weak in the PDE sense) to the KS-SNS system. A novel approximate KS-SNS system with proper regularization and cut-off operators in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is introduced, and the existence of approximate solution is proved by some a priori uniform bounds and a careful analysis on the approximation scheme. Under appropriate assumptions, two types of stochastic entropy-energy inequalities that seem to be new in their forms are derived, which together with the Prohorov theorem and Jakubowski-Skorokhod theorem enables us to show that the sequence of approximate solutions converges to a global martingale weak solution. In addition, when $\chi(\cdot)\equiv \textrm{const.}&gt;0$, we prove that the solution is pathwise unique, and hence by the Yamada-Wantanabe theorem that the KS-SNS system admits a unique global pathwise weak solution.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>
