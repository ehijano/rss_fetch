      <title>A Change Language for Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs) are general-purpose computable representations of some domain, such as human anatomy, and are frequently a crucial part of modern information systems. Most of these structures change over time, incorporating new knowledge or information that was previously missing. Managing these changes is a challenge, both in terms of communicating changes to users, and providing mechanisms to make it easier for multiple stakeholders to contribute.
  To fill that need, we have created KGCL, the Knowledge Graph Change Language, a standard data model for describing changes to KGs and ontologies at a high level, and an accompanying human-readable controlled natural language. This language serves two purposes: a curator can use it to request desired changes, and it can also be used to describe changes that have already happened, corresponding to the concepts of "apply patch" and "diff" commonly used for managing changes in text documents and computer programs. Another key feature of KGCL is that descriptions are at a high enough level to be useful and understood by a variety of stakeholders--for example, ontology edits can be specified by commands like "add synonym 'arm' to 'forelimb'" or "move 'Parkinson disease' under 'neurodegenerative disease'".
  We have also built a suite of tools for managing ontology changes. These include an automated agent that integrates with and monitors GitHub ontology repositories and applies any requested changes, and a new component in the BioPortal ontology resource that allows users to make change requests directly from within the BioPortal user interface.
  Overall, the KGCL data model, its controlled natural language, and associated tooling allow for easier management and processing of changes associated with the development of ontologies and KGs.</description>

      <title>A Simple Algorithm for Worst-Case Optimal Join and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an elementary branch and bound algorithm with a simple analysis of why it achieves worstcase optimality for join queries on classes of databases defined respectively by cardinality or acyclic degree constraints. We then show that if one is given a reasonable way for recursively estimating upper bounds on the number of answers of the join queries, our algorithm can be turned into algorithm for uniformly sampling answers with expected running time $O(UP/OUT)$ where $UP$ is the upper bound, $OUT$ is the actual number of answers and $O(\cdot)$ ignores polylogarithmic factors. Our approach recovers recent results on worstcase optimal join algorithm and sampling in a modular, clean and elementary way.</description>

      <title>Research Pearl: The ROSI Operating System Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents some preliminary results concerning a new user-friendly operating system interface based on the relational data model that is currently under development at the University of Texas at Austin. The premise of our work is that a relational model of the operating system environment wil produce a user and programmer interface to the system: is easier to use, is easier to learn, and allows greater portability as compared with existing operating system interfaces. Our approach is to model elements of the operating system environment as relations and to model operating system commands as statements in a relational language.
  In adapting the relational model to an operating system environment, we found it necessary to extend the model and improve existing relational languages. The extensions to the relational model are designed to allow a more natural representation of elements of the environment. Our language extensions exploit the universal relation model and utilize the graphical capabilities of modern workstations. The nature of our investigations is ranging from practical implementation issues to the more theoretical questions of modeling and language semanties.</description>

      <title>Defining a new perspective: Enterprise Information Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper adduces a novel definition of regulatory enterprise information governance as a strategic framework that acts through control mechanisms designed to assure accountability in managing decision rights over information and data assets in organizations. This new pragmatic definition takes the perspectives of both the practitioner and of the scholar. It builds upon earlier definitions to take a novel and more clearly regulatory approach and to synthesize a new definition for such governance; to build out a view of it as a scalable regulatory framework for large or complex organizations that sees governance from this new perspective as a business architecture or target operating model in this increasingly critical domain. The paper supports and enables scholarly consideration and further research. It looks at definitions of information and data; of strategy in relation to information and data; of data management; of enterprise architecture; of governance, and governance as a type of strategic endeavor, and of the nature of strategic and tactical policies and standards that form the basis for such governance.</description>

      <title>RACOON: An LLM-based Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Column Type Annotation with a Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important component of data exploration and integration, Column Type Annotation (CTA) aims to label columns of a table with one or more semantic types. With the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have started to explore the possibility of using LLMs for CTA, leveraging their strong zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we build on this promising work and improve on LLM-based methods for CTA by showing how to use a Knowledge Graph (KG) to augment the context information provided to the LLM. Our approach, called RACOON, combines both pre-trained parametric and non-parametric knowledge during generation to improve LLMs' performance on CTA. Our experiments show that RACOON achieves up to a 0.21 micro F-1 improvement compared against vanilla LLM inference.</description>

      <title>CAMAL: Optimizing LSM-trees via Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning to optimize LSM-tree structure, aiming to reduce the cost of processing various read/write operations. We introduce a new approach Camal, which boasts the following features: (1) ML-Aided: Camal is the first attempt to apply active learning to tune LSM-tree based key-value stores. The learning process is coupled with traditional cost models to improve the training process; (2) Decoupled Active Learning: backed by rigorous analysis, Camal adopts active learning paradigm based on a decoupled tuning of each parameter, which further accelerates the learning process; (3) Easy Extrapolation: Camal adopts an effective mechanism to incrementally update the model with the growth of the data size; (4) Dynamic Mode: Camal is able to tune LSM-tree online under dynamically changing workloads; (5) Significant System Improvement: By integrating Camal into a full system RocksDB, the system performance improves by 28% on average and up to 8x compared to a state-of-the-art RocksDB design.</description>

      <title>Data governance: A Critical Foundation for Data Driven Decision-Making in Operations and Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing sector is increasingly facing the challenge of data usability, which is becoming a widespread phenomenon and a new contemporary concern. In response, Data Governance (DG) emerges as a viable avenue to address data challenges. This study aims to call attention on DG research in the field of operations and supply chain management (OSCM). Based on literature research, we investigate research gaps in academia. Built upon three case studies, we exanimated and analyzed real life data issues in the industry. Four types of cause related to data issues were found: 1) human factors, 2) lack of written rules and regulations, 3) ineffective technological hardware and software, and 4) lack of resources. Subsequently, a three-pronged research framework was suggested. This paper highlights the urgency for research on DG in OSCM, outlines a research pathway for fellow scholars, and offers guidance to industry in the design and implementation of DG strategies.</description>

      <title>Data Management in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising tool for transforming the landscape of computing technology. Recent efforts have applied quantum techniques to classical database challenges, such as query optimization, data integration, index selection, and transaction management. In this paper, we shift focus to a critical yet underexplored area: data management for quantum computing. We are currently in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where qubits, while promising, are fragile and still limited in scale. After differentiating quantum data from classical data, we outline current and future data management paradigms in the NISQ era and beyond. We address the data management challenges arising from the emerging demands of near-term quantum computing. Our goal is to chart a clear course for future quantum-oriented data management research, establishing it as a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Answers to Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Relational Algebra and Its Applications to Data Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A range of data insight analytical tasks involves analyzing a large set of tables of different schemas, possibly induced by various groupings, to find salient patterns. This paper presents Multi-Relational Algebra, an extension of the classic Relational Algebra, to facilitate such transformations and their compositions. Multi-Relational Algebra has two main characteristics: (1) Information Unit. The information unit is a slice $(r, X)$, where $r$ is a (region) tuple, and $X$ is a (feature) table. Specifically, a slice can encompass multiple columns, which surpasses the information unit of "a single tuple" or "a group of tuples of one column" in the classic relational algebra, (2) Schema Flexibility. Slices can have varying schemas, not constrained to a single schema. This flexibility further expands the expressive power of the algebra. Through various examples, we show that multi-relational algebra can effortlessly express many complex analytic problems, some of which are beyond the scope of traditional relational analytics. We have implemented and deployed a service for multi-relational analytics. Due to a unified logical design, we are able to conduct systematic optimization for a variety of seemingly different tasks. Our service has garnered interest from numerous internal teams who have developed data-insight applications using it, and serves millions of operators daily.</description>

      <title>Synthetic SQL Column Descriptions and Their Impact on Text-to-SQL Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and text-to-SQL models. In this paper, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate detailed natural language descriptions for SQL database columns, aiming to improve text-to-SQL performance and automate metadata creation. We create a dataset of gold column descriptions based on the BIRD-Bench benchmark, manually refining its column descriptions and creating a taxonomy for categorizing column difficulty. Through evaluating several LLMs, we find that incorporating these column descriptions consistently enhances text-to-SQL model performance, particularly for larger models like GPT-4o, Qwen2 72B and Mixtral 22Bx8. However, models struggle with columns that exhibit inherent ambiguity, highlighting the need for manual expert input. Notably, Qwen2-generated descriptions, containing by annotators deemed superfluous information, outperform manually curated gold descriptions, suggesting that models benefit from more detailed metadata than humans expect. Future work will investigate the specific features of these high-performing descriptions and explore other types of metadata, such as numerical reasoning and synonyms, to further improve text-to-SQL systems. The dataset, annotations and code will all be made available.</description>
