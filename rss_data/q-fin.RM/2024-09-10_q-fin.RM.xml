      <title>Quantifying Seasonal Weather Risk in Indian Markets: Stochastic Model for Risk-Averse State-Specific Temperature Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report presents a stochastic framework for pricing temperature derivatives in Indian markets accounting for both monsoon and winter seasons. Utilising historical temperature and electricity consumption data from 12 Indian states we develop a model based on a modified mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and employ Monte Carlo simulations for pricing. Our analysis reveals significant variations in option pricing across states with monsoon call options ranging from 10.78 USD to 182.82 USD and winter put options from 48.65 USD to 194.99 USD. The introduction of a risk aversion parameter shows substantial impacts on pricing leading to an increase of up to 416 percentage in option prices for certain states. Sensitivity analyses indicate that option prices are more responsive to changes in volatility than to mean reversion rates. Additionally extreme weather scenarios can shift option prices by up to 409 percentage during heatwaves and decrease by 60 percentage during cold waves. These findings emphasise the importance of state-specific and season-specific approaches in temperature derivative pricing highlighting the need for tailored risk management strategies in India's diverse climate.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Optimal Peer-to-Peer Risk Sharing with Robust Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Pareto optimality in a decentralized peer-to-peer risk-sharing market where agents' preferences are represented by robust distortion risk measures that are not necessarily convex. We obtain a characterization of Pareto-optimal allocations of the aggregate risk in the market, and we show that the shape of the allocations depends primarily on each agent's assessment of the tail of the aggregate risk. We quantify the latter via an index of probabilistic risk aversion, and we illustrate our results using concrete examples of popular families of distortion functions. As an application of our results, we revisit the market for flood risk insurance in the United States. We present the decentralized risk sharing arrangement as an alternative to the current centralized market structure, and we characterize the optimal allocations in a numerical study with historical flood data. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of a decentralized insurance scheme in this setting.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abstract theory of risk measures is well-developed for certain classes of solid subspaces of $L^{0}$. We provide an example to illustrate that this framework is insufficient to deal with the subtleties of incomplete markets. To remedy this problem, we consider risk measures on the subspace generated by a closed, absolutely convex, and bounded subset $K\subset L^{0}$, which represents the attainable securities. In this context, we introduce the equicontinuous Fatou property. Under the existence of a certain topology $\tau$ on $\mathrm{span}(K)$, interpreted as a generalized weak-star topology, we obtain an equivalence between the equicontinuous Fatou property, and lower semicontinuity with respect to $\tau$. As a corollary, we obtain tractable dual representations for such risk measures, which subsumes essentially all known results on weak-star representations of risk measures. This dual representation allows one to prove that all risk measures of this form extend, in a maximal way, to the ideal generated by $\mathrm{span}(K)$ while preserving a Fatou-like property.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equations and zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games with non-Markovian regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games in a regime switching model. The coefficients of the games depend on the underlying noises, so it is a non-Markovian regime switching model. Based on the solutions of a new kind of multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equation (SRE) and a multidimensional linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with unbounded coefficients, we provide closed-loop optimal feedback control-strategy pairs for the two players. The main contribution of this paper, which is of great importance in its own right from the BSDE theory point of view, is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the new kind of SRE. Notably, the first component of the solution (as a process) is capable of taking positive and negative values simultaneously. For homogeneous systems, we obtain the optimal feedback control-strategy pairs under general closed convex cone control constraints. Finally, these results are applied to portfolio selection games with full or partial no-shorting constraint in a regime switching market with random coefficients.</description>
