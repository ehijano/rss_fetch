      <title>Vector Linear Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secure summation problem, where $K$ users wish to compute the sum of their inputs at a server while revealing nothing about all $K$ inputs beyond the desired sum, is generalized in two aspects - first, the desired function is an arbitrary linear function (multiple linear combinations) of the $K$ inputs instead of just the sum; second, rather than protecting all $K$ inputs, we wish to guarantee that no information is leaked about an arbitrary linear function of the $K$ inputs. For this vector linear generalization of the secure summation problem, we characterize the optimal randomness cost, i.e., to compute one instance of the desired vector linear function, the minimum number of the random key variables held by the users is equal to the dimension of the vector space that is in the span of the vectors formed by the coefficients of the linear function to protect but not in the span of the vectors formed by the coefficients of the linear function to compute.</description>

      <title>A Differential Equation Approach to the Most-Informative Boolean Function Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the most-informative Boolean function conjecture using a differential equation approach. This leads to a formulation of a functional inequality on finite-dimensional random variables. We also develop a similar inequality in the case of the Hellinger conjecture. Finally, we conjecture a specific finite dimensional inequality that, if proved, will lead to a proof of the Boolean function conjecture in the balanced case. We further show that the above inequality holds modulo four explicit inequalities (all of which seems to hold via numerical simulation) with the first three containing just two variables and a final one involving four variables.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law Tradeoff Between Throughput and Sensing Distance in Large ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tradeoff between communication and sensing performance of \emph{ad hoc} integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) wireless networks. Specifically, we consider that $n$ nodes are randomly located in an extended network with area $n$ and transmit ISAC signals. Under the pure path loss channel gain model and the condition that the transmission power scales according to the communication distance, we fully characterize the optimal scaling law tradeoff between throughput and sensing distance by proposing an achievable scheme and proving its converse. Our results can be interpreted as follows: by reducing the throughput by a factor of a function of $n$, the sensing range order improves according to the same function of $n$, raised to the power of the ratio between the path loss factors in communication and sensing. We prove that the same result also holds true for ISAC networks with random fading, despite the uncertainty on the connectivity and power level created by random fading. In addition, we show that the scaling law tradeoff cannot be improved by allowing the transmission power and communication distance to scale freely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work formally formulating and characterizing the communication and sensing performance scaling law tradeoff of \emph{ad hoc} ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Topological Neural Networks over the Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological neural networks (TNNs) are information processing architectures that model representations from data lying over topological spaces (e.g., simplicial or cell complexes) and allow for decentralized implementation through localized communications over different neighborhoods. Existing TNN architectures have not yet been considered in realistic communication scenarios, where channel effects typically introduce disturbances such as fading and noise. This paper aims to propose a novel TNN design, operating on regular cell complexes, that performs over-the-air computation, incorporating the wireless communication model into its architecture. Specifically, during training and inference, the proposed method considers channel impairments such as fading and noise in the topological convolutional filtering operation, which takes place over different signal orders and neighborhoods. Numerical results illustrate the architecture's robustness to channel impairments during testing and the superior performance with respect to existing architectures, which are either communication-agnostic or graph-based.</description>

      <title>ELAA-ISAC: Environmental Mapping Utilizing the LoS State of Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel environmental mapping method is proposed to outline the indoor layout utilizing the line-of-sight (LoS) state information of extremely large aperture array (ELAA) channels. It leverages the spatial resolution provided by ELAA and the mobile terminal (MT)'s mobility to infer the presence and location of obstacles in the environment. The LoS state estimation is formulated as a binary hypothesis testing problem, and the optimal decision rule is derived based on the likelihood ratio test. Subsequently, the theoretical error probability of LoS estimation is derived, showing close alignment with simulation results. Then, an environmental mapping method is proposed, which progressively outlines the layout by combining LoS state information from multiple MT locations. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately outline the environment layout, with the mapping accuracy improving as the number of service-antennas and MT locations increases. This paper also investigates the impact of channel estimation error and non-LoS (NLoS) components on the quality of environmental mapping. The proposed method exhibits particularly promising performance in LoS dominated wireless environments characterized by high Rician K-factor. Specifically, it achieves an average intersection over union (IoU) exceeding 80% when utilizing 256 service antennas and 18 MT locations.</description>

      <title>Doing More With Less: Towards More Data-Efficient Syndrome-Based Neural Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant research efforts have been directed toward developing more capable neural decoding architectures, comparatively little attention has been paid to the quality of training data. In this study, we address the challenge of constructing effective training datasets to maximize the potential of existing syndrome-based neural decoder architectures. We emphasize the advantages of using fixed datasets over generating training data dynamically and explore the problem of selecting appropriate training targets within this framework. Furthermore,we propose several heuristics for selecting training samples and present experimental evidence demonstrating that, with carefully curated datasets, it is possible to train neural decoders to achieve superior performance while requiring fewer training examples.</description>

      <title>A Note on "Constructing Bent Functions Outside the Maiorana-McFarland Class Using a General Form of Rothaus"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Zhang et al. proposed a question (not open problem) and two open problems in [IEEE TIT 63 (8): 5336--5349, 2017] about constructing bent functions by using Rothaus' construction. In this note, we prove that the sufficient conditions of Rothaus' construction are also necessary, which answers their question. Besides, we demonstrate that the second open problem, which considers the iterative method of constructing bent functions by using Rothaus' construction, has only a trivial solution. It indicates that all bent functions obtained by using Rothaus' construction iteratively can be generated from the direct sum of an initial bent function and a quadratic bent function. This directly means that Zhang et al.'s construction idea makes no contribution to the construction of bent functions. To compensate the weakness of their work, we propose an iterative construction of bent functions by using a secondary construction in [DCC 88: 2007--2035, 2020].</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Holographic MIMO: Physical Modeling and Information-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for holographic multiantenna communication, a paradigm that integrates both wide apertures and closely spaced antennas relative to the wavelength. The presented framework is physically grounded, enabling information-theoretic analyses that inherently incorporate correlation and mutual coupling among the antennas. This establishes the combined effects of correlation and coupling on the information-theoretic performance limits across SNR levels. Additionally, it reveals that, by suitably selecting the individual antenna patterns, mutual coupling can be harnessed to either reinforce or counter spatial correlations as appropriate for specific SNRs, thereby improving the performance.</description>

      <title>From Markov to Laplace: How Mamba In-Context Learns Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While transformer-based language models have driven the AI revolution thus far, their computational complexity has spurred growing interest in viable alternatives, such as structured state space sequence models (SSMs) and Selective SSMs. Among these, Mamba (S6) and its variant Mamba-2 have shown remarkable inference speed ups over transformers while achieving comparable or superior performance on complex language modeling tasks. However, despite these architectural innovations and empirical successes, the fundamental learning capabilities of Mamba remain poorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by studying in-context learning (ICL) on Markov chains and uncovering a surprising phenomenon: unlike transformers, even a single-layer Mamba efficiently learns the in-context Laplacian smoothing estimator, which is both Bayes and minimax optimal, for all Markovian orders. To explain this, we theoretically characterize the representation capacity of Mamba and reveal the fundamental role of convolution in enabling it to represent the optimal Laplacian smoothing. These theoretical insights align strongly with empirical results and, to the best of our knowledge, represent the first formal connection between Mamba and optimal statistical estimators. Finally, we outline promising research directions inspired by these findings.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Computation and Communication over MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study communication over a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with two types of transmitters: Digital transmitters hold a message from a discrete set that needs to be communicated to the receiver with vanishing error probability. Analog transmitters hold sequences of analog values. Some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in [-1,1], we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. This extended scheme works over fading channels as long as full channel state information is available at the transmitter. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We evaluate the system performance for different block lengths and Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition function of pairwise Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these bounds through the use of ''hierarchies,'' similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations. We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods for this inference problem.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem for Jump Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP) seeks to find the measure $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ on a certain path space which interpolates between state-space distributions $\rho_0$ at time $0$ and $\rho_T$ at time $T$ while minimizing the KL divergence (relative entropy) to a reference path measure $\mathbf{R}$. In this work, we tackle the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion. Under mild assumptions, with both the operator theory approach and the stochastic calculus techniques, we establish an $h$-transform theory for jump diffusions and devise an approximation method to achieve the jump-diffusion SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ as the strong-convergence limit of a sequence of harmonic $h$-transforms. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel in the study of SBP. Moreover, the $h$-transform framework and the approximation method developed in this work are robust and applicable to a relatively general class of jump diffusions. In addition, we examine the SBP of particular types of jump diffusions under additional regularity conditions and extend the existing results on the SBP from the diffusion case to the jump-diffusion setting.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Noisy Computation of High-Influence Functions, Connectivity, and Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy query model, the (binary) return value of every query (possibly repeated) is independently flipped with some fixed probability $p \in (0, 1/2)$. In this paper, we obtain tight bounds on the noisy query complexity of several fundamental problems.
  Our first contribution is to show that any Boolean function with total influence $\Omega(n)$ has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n\log n)$. Previous works often focus on specific problems, and it is of great interest to have a characterization of noisy query complexity for general functions. Our result is the first noisy query complexity lower bound of this generality, beyond what was known for random Boolean functions [Reischuk and Schmeltz, FOCS 1991].
  Our second contribution is to prove that Graph Connectivity has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$. In this problem, the goal is to determine whether an undirected graph is connected using noisy edge queries. While the upper bound can be achieved by a simple algorithm, no non-trivial lower bounds were known prior to this work.
  Last but not least, we determine the exact number of noisy queries (up to lower order terms) needed to solve the $k$-Threshold problem and the Counting problem. The $k$-Threshold problem asks to decide whether there are at least $k$ ones among $n$ bits, given noisy query access to the bits. We prove that $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log (\min\{k,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log \frac{1-p}p}$ queries are both sufficient and necessary to achieve error probability $\delta = o(1)$. Previously, such a result was only known when $\min\{k,n-k+1\}=o(n)$ [Wang, Ghaddar, Zhu and Wang, arXiv 2024]. We also show a similar $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log (\min\{k+1,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log \frac{1-p}p}$ bound for the Counting problem, where one needs to count the number of ones among $n$ bits given noisy query access and $k$ denotes the answer.</description>

Abstract: The spatial diversity and multiplexing advantages of massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) can significantly improve the capacity of massive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in machine type communications. However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs' activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this article: https://github.com/owenwang517/tvt-2025.</description>

      <title>Effcient classical error correction for parity encoded spin systems</title>

Abstract: Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have attracted engineering interest in various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate and significant efforts have been dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction between logical spins, its realization requires a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, which poses technical difficulties in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed parity-encoding (PE) architecture, consisting of a larger system of physical spins with only local connectivities between them, to avoid this diffculty in the near future QA device development. They suggested that this architecture not only reduces implementation diffculties and improves scalability, but also has intrinsic fault tolerance because logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded into the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses how to correct errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected by a very simple decoding algorithm that can be regarded as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm was shown to have comparable performance to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and improves the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. We believe that our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.</description>
