      <title>Application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Improved Optics Measurements from s star Movement at sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating Interaction Regions (IR) in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are around 15 percent along with significant variation in s star. This threshold to measure the linear optics can be improved by considering preprocessing methods involving data reconstruction such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and cross checking between different method variations, model independent and dependent methods, and turn by turn (TBT) datasets. These were then applied to analyze the movement of horizontal s star at the 8 o clock IR at RHIC (IR8). This movement was done using an optics response matrix to determine magnet strengths necessary to move horizontal s star without disturbing other optics. Data preprocessing was found to significantly aid in beat reduction around IP, with DMD demonstrating the least variability between preprocessing methods and between horizontal s star movements. These preprocessing methods will be implemented into RHIC for future linear optics analysis.</description>

      <title>femto-PIXAR: a neural network method for reconstruction of femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance, but an outstanding challenge exist for monochromatic multi-bunch studies, such as those needed for the study of fluctuations in quantum materials. In particular, there is no current method for reliably resolving the pulse intensity profile at sub-picosecond time separation between pulses. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles on the sub-picoseond pulse separation time. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network for High-Throughput Attosecond Resolution Single-shot X-ray Pulse Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As scientific facilities transition toward high-throughput, data-intensive experiments, there is a growing need for real-time computing at the edge to support autonomous decision-making and minimize data transmission bottlenecks. Department of Energy (DOE) initiatives emphasize the development of heterogeneous computing architectures that integrate machine learning (ML) models with specialized hardware such as FPGAs, GPUs, and embedded systems to meet the demands of next-generation experiments. These advances are critical for facilities such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), where high-repetition-rate experiments produce terabyte-scale datasets, requiring real-time analysis and control.
  To address this challenge, we introduce DCIFR, a deep learning framework optimized for edge processing and high-speed X-ray diagnostics at SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). DCIFR leverages a hybrid neural architecture, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and residual neural networks (ResNets) to denoise sinograms, classify X-ray sub-spikes, and extract phase separation with attosecond precision. The model achieves a phase extraction accuracy of 0.04652 radians (29.6 attoseconds at 1.2 um streaking wavelength) with inference latencies of 168.3 us and throughput exceeding 10kHz. Designed for deployment on heterogeneous architectures, DCIFR reduces computational overhead and supports future AI-driven feedback loops for ultrafast experiments. This work demonstrates the potential of edge AI and hardware acceleration to drive scalable, autonomous data analysis in next-generation DOE scientific facilities.</description>
