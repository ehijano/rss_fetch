      <title>A Wideband Holographic Array with Azimuth and Elevation Beam Steering for 5G/6G Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and fabrication of leaky-wave holograms with anisotropic properties, enabling circular polarization for single-beam radiation in desired directions. Tailored for future terrestrial networks like 5G, 6G, and beyond, the proposed antenna achieves high-gain performance with beam steering in elevation and azimuth over a wide angular range. A planar reflector enhances directivity by suppressing backward modes, while a simple feeding network ensures optimal impedance matching. The antenna operates efficiently from 16 GHz to 20 GHz (22.22% bandwidth), delivering a gain of 24.5 dB, with compact dimensions of 15 cm by 17 cm. The structure includes a reflector, monopoles, a patterned patch, a Rogers 4003C substrate, a ground plane, and a coaxial feed. Simulations, experiments, and theoretical analyses confirm the design's efficacy, showcasing 2D scanning capabilities ideal for autonomous vehicle localization systems. Its simple, scalable design supports cost-effective mass production, offering significant potential for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Berry Monopole Scattering in the Synthetic Momentum Space of a Bilayer Photonic Crystal Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry monopoles-quantized sources of Berry curvature-are fundamental to topological phases, yet their scattering remains unexplored. Here, we report for the first time the adiabatic scattering of Berry monopoles in a bilayer photonic crystal slab combining one genuine and one synthetic momentum. Two monopoles approach, collide, and scatter within this hybrid parameter space. The process is described by an effective coupled-mode model and confirmed by full-wave simulations. We further propose an experimental scheme using chiral edge states, opening a route to probe monopole interactions in synthetic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Wide-Angle Reflection Suppression of Dielectric Slabs Using Nonlocal Metasurface Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any discontinuity of constitutive parameters along a wave propagation path causes scattering. For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab, reflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical thickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional single- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the generalized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as metasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a dielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only in the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave transmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both sides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is angularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key role in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically thick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization composed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the predicted spatial dispersion law. As demonstrated numerically and experimentally, such properly devised nonlocal metasurface coatings indeed provide transmittance enhancement (and reflectance suppression) of thick dielectric slabs across a broad range of angles, paving the path to optically thin and easy-to-fabricate anti-reflective coatings efficiently operating in a wide angular range even for optically thick dielectric slabs.</description>

      <title>Unconventional localization of light with Mie-tronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of light requires high-Q cavities or spatial disorder, yet the wave nature of light may open novel opportunities. Here we suggest to employ Mie-tronics as a powerful approach to achieve the hybridization of different resonances for the enhanced confinement of light via interference effects. Contrary to a conventional approach, we employ the symmetry breaking in finite arrays of resonators to boost the Q factors by in-plane multiple scattering. Being applied to photonic moire structures, our approach yields a giant enhancement of the Purcell factor via twist-induced coupling between degenerate collective modes. Our findings reveal how finely tuned cooperative scattering can surpass conventional limits, advancing the control of wave localization in many subwavelength systems.</description>

      <title>Optical and electrical probing of plasmonic metal-molecule interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Drive-induced Non-local Interactions and Topological Bulk Transport of Extended Doublons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of boundary states and their protection against symmetry-preserving perturbations are a hallmark feature of topological systems. While this concept originally emerged in the context of sin-gle-particle phenomena in condensed-matter physics, particle interactions have recently been identi-fied as alternative means to establish topological phases. As a consequence, nonlinear topological insu-lators gained much interest as a model system for many interacting particles. However, as their mean-field model inevitably breaks down for small numbers of particles, to date, topological states composed of only few interacting particles remain experimentally largely unexplored. In our work, we explore the physics of extended interaction-induced two-particle topological states, so-called Dou-blons. We experimentally implement non-local-interactions via non-adiabatic periodic driving and dimensional mapping in an artificial photonic solid. The resonant formation of extended Doublon qua-si-particles at specific local interaction strengths is observed, allowing us to probe the topologically protected motion of these entities through the bulk of the system. Our approach is compatible to a number of established experimental platforms and paves the way for studying topological few-particle phenomena with finite interaction strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism for amplification of weak quadrupole transitions of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a plasmonic nanostructure is investigated. The theoretical description of exciton-plasmon interaction is presented and a field averaging approximation is proposed for calculations involving large excitons. Various types of copper, silver and gold-based plasmonic nanostructures are considered and their potential for enhancing quadrupole transitions is evaluated.</description>

      <title>A graphene platform for nano scale coherent interaction of surface plasmons with resonant atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a 2D graphene structure containing atomic ensemble as a platform for implementing nanoscale enhanced coherent interactions of plasmonic fields with resonant atomic systems. We determine the graphene surface plasmon modes, and the properties of its electromagnetic fields, and emphasize the role of graphene sheet separation on the interaction with atomic systems for various dipole orientations and positions between the graphene sheets. We analyze the conditions for implementation of coherent interaction of SP mode with resonant atomic ensembles. By solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the resonant interaction of surface plasmons with atoms, we derive the modified area theorem, which makes it possible to identify the most common nonlinear patterns in the behavior of plasmons under the studied conditions. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions of the area theorem, and find the possibility of stable propagation of isolated SP pulses of graphene surface plasmon modes at "fractional" pulse area values relative to $\pi$. We show that the coherent dynamics of SP fields can be realized in nanoscale design and we highlight the possibilities of using this scheme of coherent dynamics for implementing compact multimode nanoscale quantum memory and its integration with other quantum devices on the proposed platform.</description>

      <title>A single chip 1.024 Tb/s silicon photonics PAM4 receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here, we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a 32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured. The implemented 32 channel monolithic WDM optical receiver chip achieves an end-to-end latency of under 100 ps and a bit-error-rate of less than 10-12 with no equalization, pre-distortion, or digital-signal-processing, while operating at 1.024 Tb/s aggregate data-rate on a single input fiber, the largest reported data-rate for a WDM PAM4 receiver chip to date. The receiver bandwidth density of more than 3.55 Tb/s/mm2 corresponds to more than an order-of-magnitude larger bandwidth density-energy efficiency product compared to the state-of-the-art optical PAM4 receivers for beyond 100Gb/s links. The chip, integrated using GlobalFoundries 45CLO CMOS-photonic process, can be used for implementation of energy-efficient high data-rate optical links for AI applications.</description>

      <title>An improved argument principle root-search method for modes of slab waveguides, optical fibers, and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update our root-search method for transcendental equations. Our method is globally convergent and is guaranteed to locate all complex roots within a specified search domain, since it is based on Cauchy's residue theorem. We extend the implementation to treat the dispersion relations of slab waveguides and the resonances of a sphere, in addition to step-index fibers. We also implement other improvements, such as to the contour selection procedure and using non-dimensional search variables, to ensure the method remains reliable even in challenging parameter regimes. We also extend the algorithm to identify leaky modes in terms of propagation constant eigenvalue modes, revealing, to the first time to our knowledge, a discontinuity across the light line in the dispersion plot.</description>

      <title>Magneto-photoelectrochemical 2D heterojunction platform for biosensing detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors exhibit significant potential for biomolecule detection due to their high sensitivity and low background noise. However, their performance is severely constrained by the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. This study innovatively introduces a non-contact magnetic modulation strategy to suppress electron-hole recombination by manipulating carrier spin states, thereby significantly enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency. Building on this mechanism, we developed a novel magnetically modulated PEC biosensing platform based on the MXenes/cobalt-doped titanium dioxide (Co-TiO2) heterostructure. This platform achieved ultrasensitive detection of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Compared to an identical probe-modified biosensor without magnetic field application, the developed platform demonstrated a 68.75% enhancement in detection sensitivity and achieved an ultralow detection limit for PKA of 0.00016 U/mL. It also exhibited a wide linear range from 0.005 to 80 U/mL. This research not only provides a novel methodology for kinase activity analysis but also pioneers the innovative strategy of magnetic modulation for enhanced PEC sensing. It opens new avenues for developing high-performance biosensing platforms, holding significant promise for early disease diagnosis and drug screening applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum noise reduction in a Raman amplifier via quantum correlation between atom and light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Generation of Near-ideal Indistinguishable Two-Photon State by Incoherent Light</title>

Abstract: High-quality quantum states lie at the heart of advanced quantum information processing. The degree of photon indistinguishability is critical for applications from photonic quantum computation to precision metrology. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference effect provides a rigorous quantification method, with its visibility serving as the ultimate benchmark for source quality. Generally, the coherent pumping is widely regarded as indispensable for the preparation of quantum sources. As a result, incoherent light sources have seen limited applications in the current quantum technologies. In this work, we generate an indistinguishable two-photon state by incoherent light generated by frequency doubling of Amplified Spontaneous Emission light. The theoretical analysis indicates that phase randomization of the pumping does not affect the coincidence visibility in two-photon intensity interference. Moreover, temporal incoherence further enhances the symmetry of the generated spectrum in second-harmonic generation. In the experiment, the incoherently pumped photon sources exhibit a heralding efficiency of approximately 60\% and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 15000. The observed HOM interference fringes show the visibility of 99.1\% without any spectrum filtering, confirming the near-ideal indistinguishability of the photons. Our study reveals the role of temporal coherence in second-order nonlinear interactions, it provide a potential approach to use an easily accessible incoherent light for engineering high-quality quantum sources.</description>

      <title>Novel multifunctional plasmonic fiber probe: Enabling plasmonic heating and SERS sensing for biomedical applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical fiber-based platforms are increasingly explored as compact, minimally invasive tools for integrated photonic functionalities in biomedical applications. Among these, the combination of plasmonic heating and optical sensing on a single fiber tip offers compelling opportunities for localized photothermal actuation and in situ molecular detection. In this work, we present a multifunctional plasmonic fiber probe (PFP) that enables spectral multiplexing of thermo-plasmonic heating and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). This dual capability is achieved by integrating gold nanoislands (AuNIs) onto the flat facet of a multimode optical fiber using a solid-state dewetting process - a straightforward and scalable fabrication method that avoids the complexity of lithographic techniques. We characterize how the morphology of the AuNIs modulates optical extinction, photothermal response, and electromagnetic field enhancement across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Specifically, we demonstrate efficient, wavelength-dependent heating under visible light and strong SERS signal enhancement under near-infrared excitation, both supported by electromagnetic and thermal simulations. The ability to decouple photothermal stimulation and Raman sensing in a single, fiber-integrated device addresses a current gap in lab-on-fiber technologies, where multifunctional operation is often constrained to a single wavelength.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides Based on Large Step Size AdaMax from Far-Field Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing multimode waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, current approaches focus predominantly on modal power distribution and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. In this work, under a power-normalization constraint, we employ the AdaMax optimizer with a large-step-size strategy to perform modal analysis of multimode waveguides from far-field amplitude measurements. Our method retrieves both the modal power distribution and the modal relative-phase distribution, and we elucidate how twin-image ambiguity limits the capability to analyze modal relative-phase distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well for both rectangular and circular waveguides, maintaining high accuracy and robustness under noise with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 20 to 120 dB, and achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and computational cost over comparable methods. This method provides a novel solution for modal analysis with broad application potential.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Model for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>

Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately predict the band structure and topology of crystalline systems and they have been heavily used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is quite straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a basis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave equation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization methods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum chemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be achieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed by Solja\v{c}i\'c et. al., which regularize the $\Gamma$-point obstruction arising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous phase locking in a broad-area semiconductor laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad-area semiconductor lasers are employed in many high-power applications, however, their spatio-temporal dynamics is complex and intrinsically unstable due to the interaction of several transverse lasing modes. A dynamical and spatio-spectral analysis with ultra-high resolution of commercial broad-area lasers reveals multiplets of phase-locked first- and second-order transverse modes that are spontaneously created by the nonlinear dynamics for a wide range of operation parameters. Phase locking between modes of different transverse order is demonstrated by comparing the linewidths of the lasing modes to that of their beat note and by a direct measurement of their phase fluctuation correlations. The spontaneous phase locking is unexpected since the overall dynamics is unstable and the system lacks any intentional feature to induce locking. This partially synchronized dynamical state with groups of synchronized and unsynchronized laser modes coexisting is similar to what is called a chimera state in networks of coupled oscillators, hence indicating that such states may exist in a wider range of systems than previously assumed. Moreover, some of the phase-locked modes do not exist on the passive-cavity level, but are created by the nonlinear dynamics, an effect not previously observed in the context of partially synchronized laser modes.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional, time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Fourier Analysis for High-Efficiency Structural Design: A Case Study on Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enumeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric design of structures with optimized physical and chemical properties is one of the core topics in materials science. However, designing new functional materials is challenging due to the vast number of existing and the possible unknown structures to be enumerated and difficulties in mining the underlying correlations between structures and their properties. Here, we propose a universal method for periodic structural design and property optimization. The key in our approach is a deep-learning assisted inverse Fourier transform, which enables the creation of arbitrary geometries within crystallographic space groups. It effectively explores extensive parameter spaces to identify ideal structures with desired properties. Taking the research of three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures as a case study, this method is capable of modelling numerous structures and identifying their photonic bandgaps in just a few hours. We confirmed the established knowledge that the widest photonic bandgaps exist in network morphologies, among which the single diamond (dia net) reigns supreme. Additionally, this method identified a rarely-known lcs topology with excellent photonic properties, highlighting the infinitely extensible application boundaries of our approach. This work demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the Fourier-based method, advancing material design and providing insights for next-generation functional materials.</description>

      <title>Super light-by-light scattering in vacuum induced by intense vortex lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collision of ultra-intense optical laser and X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses is a promising approach to detecting nonlinear vacuum polarization (VP), a long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics remaining to be tested. Identifying the signals induced by polarized vacuum relies on purifying the X-ray polarization and poses significant challenges due to strongly reduced signal and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we propose an approach that allows one to directly detect VP signals without the need for an X-ray polarizer. We identify a new VP effect in collision of an X-ray probe with an intense laser in a vortex mode, which we call the super light-by-light scattering (super-LBL), through which signal photons are kicked out of the X-ray background with large tangential momentum. Super-LBL originates from the gradient force of the vortical vacuum current in azimuthal direction and induces momentum exchange beyond the transverse momentum of laser-photon. This effect efficiently sets the scattered signal photons apart from the X-ray background, producing observable signals with both the strength and SNR more than two orders of magnitude higher than those from the known VP effects. This finding paves the way for single-shot detection of nonlinear VP phenomena with current ultra-intense laser and XFEL technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drive to miniaturize optical frequency combs for practical deployment has spotlighted microresonator solitons as a promising chip-scale candidate. However, these soliton microcombs could be very power-hungry when their span increases, especially with fine comb spacings. As a result, realizing an octave-spanning comb at microwave repetition rates for direct optical-microwave linkage is considered not possible for photonic integration due to the high power requirements. Here, we introduce the concept of resonant-coupling to soliton microcombs to reduce pump consumption significantly. Compared to conventional waveguide-coupled designs, we demonstrate (i) a threefold increase in spectral span for high-power combs and (ii) up to a tenfold reduction in repetition frequency for octave-spanning operation. This configuration is compatible with laser integration and yields reliable, turnkey soliton generation. By eliminating the long-standing pump-power bottleneck, microcombs will soon become readily available for portable optical clocks, massively parallel data links, and field-deployable spectrometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>One- and two-photon spectroscopy with a test of the Kennard-Stepanov relation in high-pressure two-species xenon-noble gas mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between the absorption and the emission spectral lineshapes of dense atomic and molecular media, such as dye solutions and alkali-noble buffer gas mixtures at high pressure, in many cases there exists a universal scaling, the Kennard-Stepanov relation, which is a manifestation of detailed balance. This relation plays a crucial role in recent Bose-Einstein condensation experiments of visible-spectral-photons in e.g.~dye-solution-filled optical microcavities. It has recently been proposed to use high-pressure xenon-noble gas mixtures as a thermalization medium for vacuum-ultraviolet regime photons, so as to extend the achievable wavelength range of such Bose-Einstein-condensed optical sources from the visible to the vacuum-ultraviolet regime. In this work, we report two-photon excitation spectroscopy measurements of ground state ($5p^6$) xenon atoms subject to up to 80bar of helium or krypton buffer gas pressure, respectively, in the 220-260nm wavelength range. The study of such two-photon spectra is of interest e.g.~for the exploration of possible pumping schemes of a future vacuum-ultraviolet photon Bose-Einstein condensate. We have also recorded absorption and emission spectra of the $5p^6 \leftrightarrow 5p^56s$ single-photon transition near 147nm wavelength of xenon atoms subject to 80bar of krypton buffer gas pressure. We find that the ratio of absorption and emission shows a Kennard-Stepanov scaling, which suggests that such gas mixtures are promising candidates as a thermalization medium for a Bose-Einstein condensate of vacuum-ultraviolet photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine with high angular resolution the two-dimensional profile of a light beam using an interferogram from a non-redundantly masked aperture. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform illuminations across the aperture. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. By using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source to validate the method and its results against existing methods, this paper represents the first real-world application of closure amplitudes to directly determine the light beam's profile using optical interferometry in the high angular resolution regime.</description>

Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) promise transformative gains in speed and energy efficiency for artificial intelligence (AI) by leveraging the intrinsic parallelism and wave nature of light. However, their scalability has been fundamentally limited by the high power requirements of conventional nonlinear optical elements. Here, we present a low-power nonlinear activation scheme based on a three-level quantum system driven by dual laser fields. This platform introduces a two-channel nonlinear activation matrix with both self- and cross-nonlinearities, enabling true multi-input, multi-output optical processing. The system supports tunable activation behaviors, including sigmoid and ReLU functions, at ultralow power levels (17 uW per neuron). We validate our approach through theoretical modeling and experimental demonstration in rubidium vapor cells, showing the feasibility of scaling to deep AONNs with millions of neurons operating under 20 W of total optical power. Crucially, we also demonstrate the all-optical generation of gradient-like signals with backpropagation, paving the way for all optical training.

      <title>Integrated Silicon Nitride Devices via Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonic devices made of silicon nitride (SiN), which can be integrated with silicon-on-insulator and III-V platforms, are expected to drive the expansion of silicon photonics technology. However, the relatively low refractive index contrast of SiN is often considered a limitation for creating compact and efficient devices. Here, we present three freeform SiN devices-a coarse wavelength-division multiplexer, a five-mode mode-division multiplexer, and a polarization beam splitter-while systematically benchmarking both the design capability and the fabrication repeatability and robustness of inverse-designed components. We demonstrate up to a 1200x reduction in footprint while maintaining relatively large minimum feature sizes of up to 160 nm, showing that inverse-designed SiN devices can be as compact as their silicon counterparts. These results enable high-density integration in SiN photonics and pave the way for multidimensional data transmission and quantum applications, as the inverse design technique can be applied to different SiN thicknesses and is potentially extendable to other low- and mid-index platforms.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Compensation for Non-Ideal Channels in AWG-Based FBG Interrogator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared: (1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span, maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across diverse FBG sensor configurations.</description>

      <title>Mode-dependent Emission Thresholds and Frequencies in Metal Nanoparticles within Gain-enhanced Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mode-resolved analysis of emission thresholds in metal nanoparticles embedded within an infinite gain medium, using Mie scattering theory as a rigorous framework. Focusing on the first three resonant modes, we identify the onset of emission by locating the complex zeros of the electric scattering coefficient a_n(omega), which serve as indicators of lasing conditions. Our hybrid numerical scheme-combining coarse bracketing and two-dimensional Newton refinement-enables precise determination of both the threshold gain G_th,n and the corresponding emission frequency omega_th,n across varying particle radii. The results uncover strong size-dependent behavior, with higher-order modes in larger particles exhibiting significantly reduced threshold gain. These insights elucidate the modal dynamics underlying plasmonic nanolasing and provide design guidelines for active photonic systems leveraging gain-enhanced nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric solitons in nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators</title>

Abstract: Dissipative solitons and their associated low-noise, chip-scale frequency combs hold great potential for applications in optical communications, spectroscopy, precision time-keeping, and beyond. These applications drive interest in shifting soliton spectra to frequency bands far detuned from the telecom's C-band pump sources. Recent demonstrations have utilized second-harmonic generation and degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to shift soliton combs away from the primary pump. However, these approaches lack the tunability offered by nondegenerate OPOs. This work presents a proof-of-principle demonstration of solitons in a silicon-nitride microresonator-based nondegenerate OPO system with engineered dispersion and optimized coupling rates. By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the C-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q O-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at the pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength beyond
  2$\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are distinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them - hyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode, phase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive bistability in the parametric signal. We investigate the properties of hyperparametric solitons, including their parametrically generated background and multisoliton states, both experimentally and through theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Tunable Entangled Photon Source for Multiplexed Time-Resolved Fluorescence on a Nanophotonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact, scalable, and multiplexed fluorescence lifetime sensors are of great interest for point-of-care diagnostics. However, current solutions either lack broad-range wavelength-tuning capabilities or involve complex optical setups that hinder miniaturization. On-chip entangled photon sources offer a promising alternative for time-resolved spectroscopy with their strong temporal correlations, tunable spectral characteristics, and small footprints. Here, we develop a temperature-tunable, visible quantum light source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) with a continuous tuning range greater than one octave, spanning 564.5~nm to 1.494~$\mu$m using only one waveguide. The tunability is enabled by utilizing type-I phase matching. We measured an on-chip efficiency of $(3.88\pm0.20)\times10^{9}$ pairs/s/mW, comparable to the most efficient type-0 bulk lithium niobate sources. These results show that the TFLN platform is ideal for on-chip integrated photonic and multiplexed lifetime imaging and sensing.</description>
