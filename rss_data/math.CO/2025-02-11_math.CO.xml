      <title>Advancing Geometry with AI: Multi-agent Generation of Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polytopes are one of the most primitive concepts underlying geometry. Discovery and study of polytopes with complex structures provides a means of advancing scientific knowledge. Construction of polytopes with specific extremal structure is very difficult and time-consuming. Having an automated tool for the generation of such extremal examples is therefore of great value. We present an Artificial Intelligence system capable of generating novel polytopes with very high complexity, whose abilities we demonstrate in three different and challenging scenarios: the Hirsch Conjecture, the k-neighbourly problem and the longest monotone paths problem. For each of these three problems the system was able to generate novel examples, which match or surpass the best previously known bounds. Our main focus was the Hirsch Conjecture, which had remained an open problem for over 50 years. The highly parallel A.I. system presented in this paper was able to generate millions of examples, with many of them surpassing best known previous results and possessing properties not present in the earlier human-constructed examples. For comparison, it took leading human experts over 50 years to handcraft the first example of a polytope exceeding the bound conjectured by Hirsch, and in the decade since humans were able to construct only a scarce few families of such counterexample polytopes. With the adoption of computer-aided methods, the creation of new examples of mathematical objects stops being a domain reserved only for human expertise. Advances in A.I. provide mathematicians with yet another powerful tool in advancing mathematical knowledge. The results presented demonstrate that A.I. is capable of addressing problems in geometry recognized as extremely hard, and also to produce extremal examples different in nature from the ones constructed by humans.</description>

      <title>On the number of edges in saturated partial embeddings of maximal planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extremal properties of saturated partial plane embeddings of maximal planar graphs. For a planar graph $G$, the plane-saturation number $\mathrm{sat}_{\mathcal{P}}(G)$ denotes the minimum number of edges in a plane subgraph of $G$ such that the addition of any edge either violates planarity or results in a graph that is not a subgraph of $G$. We focus on maximal planar graphs and establish an upper bound on $\mathrm{sat}_{\mathcal{P}}(G)$ by showing there exists a universal constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that $\mathrm{sat}_{\mathcal{P}}(G) &lt; (3-\epsilon)v(G)$ for any maximal planar graph $G$ with $v(G) \geq 16$. This answers a question posed by Clifton and Simon. Additionally, we derive lower bound results and demonstrate that for maximal planar graphs with sufficiently large number of vertices, the minimum ratio $\mathrm{sat}_{\mathcal{P}}(G)/e(G)$ lies within the interval $(1/16, 1/9 + o(1)]$.</description>

      <title>Modularity of random intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity was introduced by Newman and Girvan in 2004 and is used as a measure of community structure of networks represented by graphs. In our work we study modularity of the random intersection graph model first considered by Karo\'nski, Scheinerman, and Singer--Cohen in 1999. Since their introduction, random intersection graphs has attracted much attention, mostly due to their application as networks models. In our work we determine the range of parameters in which modularity detects well the community structure of the random intersection graphs, as well as give a range of parameters for which there is a community structure present but not revealed by modularity. We also relate modularity of the random intersection graph to the modularity of other known random graph models.</description>

      <title>A Bose-Laskar-Hoffman theory for $\mu$-bounded graphs with fixed smallest eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, by Ramsey and Hoffman theory, Koolen, Yang, and Yang presented a structural result on graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-3$ and large minimum degree. In this study, we depart from the conventional use of Ramsey theory and instead employ a novel approach that combines the Bose-Laskar type argument with Hoffman theory to derive structural insights into $\mu$-bounded graphs with fixed smallest eigenvalue. Our method establishes a reasonable bound on the minimum degree. Note that local graphs of distance-regular graphs are $\mu$-bounded. We apply these results to characterize the structure for any local graph of a distance-regular graph with classical parameters $(D,b,\alpha,\beta)$. Consequently, we show that the parameter $\alpha$ is bounded by a cubic polynomial in $b$ if $D \geq 9$ and $b \geq 2$. Also we show that $\alpha \leq 2$ if $b =2$ and $D \geq 12$.</description>

      <title>Lowering operators on $K$-$k$-Schur functions and a lowering operator formula for closed $K$-$k$-Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives a systematic study of the lowering operators acting on the $K$-$k$-Schur functions, motivated by the pivotal role played by the operators in the definition and study of Katalan functions. A lowering operator formula for closed $K$-$k$-Schur functions is obtained. As an application, a combinatorial proof is provided to a conjecture on closed $k$-Schur Katalan functions, posed by Blasiak, Morse and Seelinger, and recently proved by Ikeda, Iwao and Naito by a different method.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of the Zeon Combinatorial Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$ on $m$ vertices, the zeon combinatorial Laplacian $\Lambda$ of $G$ is an $m\times m$ graph having entries in the complex zeon algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{Z}$. It is shown here that if the graph has a unique vertex $v$ of degree $k$, then the Laplacian has a unique zeon eigenvalue $\lambda$ whose scalar part is $k$. Moreover, the canonical expansion of the nilpotent (dual) part of $\lambda$ counts the cycles based at vertex $v$ in $G$. With an appropriate generalization of the zeon combinatorial Laplacian of $G$, all cycles in $G$ are counted by $\Lambda$. Moreover when a generalized zeon combinatorial Laplacian $\Lambda$ can be viewed as a self-adjoint operator on the $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{Z}$-module of $m$-tuples of zeon elements, it can be interpreted as a quantum random variable whose values reveal the cycle structure of the underlying graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Gorensteinification of the face ring of a cycle is totally $p$-anisotropic in characteristic $p$. In other words, given an appropriate Artinian reduction, it contains no nonzero $p$-isotropic elements. Moreover, we prove that the linear system of parameters can be chosen corresponding to a geometric realization with points on the moment curve. In particular, this implies that the parameters do not have to be chosen very generically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $\mathbb{D}(G)$ denote the set of all strong orientations of $G$, and the oriented diameter of $G$ is $f(G)=\min \{diam(D) \mid D \in \mathbb{D}(G)\}$, which is the minimum value of the diameters $diam(D)$ where $D \in \mathbb{D}(G)$. In this paper, we determine the oriented diameter of complete tripartite graphs $K(3,3, q)$ and $K(3,4, q)$, these are special cases that arise in determining the oriented diameter of $K(3, p, q)$.</description>

      <title>Extended weak order for the affine symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended weak order on a Coxeter group $W$ is the poset of biclosed sets in its root system. In (Barkley-Speyer 2024), it was shown that when $W=\widetilde{S}_n$ is the affine symmetric group, then the extended weak order is a quotient of the lattice $L_n$ of translation-invariant total orderings of the integers. In this article, we give a combinatorial introduction to $L_n$ and the extended weak order on $\widetilde{S}_n$. We show that $L_n$ is an algebraic completely semidistributive lattice. We describe its canonical join representations using a cyclic version of Reading's non-crossing arc diagrams. We also show analogous statements for the lattice of all total orders of the integers, which is the extended weak order on the symmetric group $S_\infty$. A key property of both of these lattices is that they are profinite; we also prove that a profinite lattice is join semidistributive if and only if its compact elements have canonical join representations. We conjecture that the extended weak order of any Coxeter group is a profinite semidistributive lattice.</description>

      <title>A Note on One-Hole Domino Tilings of Squares and Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the number of domino tilings of an odd-by-odd rectangle that leave one hole. This problem is equivalent to the number of near-perfect matchings of the odd-by-odd rectangular grid. For any particular position of the vacancy on the $(2k+1)\times (2k+1)$ square grid, we show that the number of near-perfect matchings is a multiple of $2^k$, and from this follows a conjecture of Kong that the total number of near-perfect matchings is a multiple of $2^k$. We also determine the parity of the number of near-perfect matchings with a particular vacancy for the rectangle case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce rook-Eulerian polynomials, a generalization of the classical Eulerian polynomials arising from complete rook placements on Ferrers boards, and prove that they are real-rooted. We show that a natural context in which to interpret these rook placements is as lower intervals of $312$-avoiding permutations in the Bruhat order. We end with some variations and generalizations along this theme.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for Constructing Related Spanning Directed Forests of Minimum Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing directed spanning forests of the minimum weight, in which the maximum possible degree of affinity between the minimum forests is preserved when the number of trees changes. The correctness of the algorithm is checked and its complexity is determined, which does not exceed $ O (N ^ 3) $ for dense graphs. The result of the algorithm is a set of related spanning minimal forests consisting of $ k $ trees for all admissible $ k $.</description>

Abstract: Let $f\colon \{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ be a monotone Boolean functions, let $\psi_k(f)$ denote the Shapley value of the $k$th variable and $b_k(f)$ denote the Banzhaf value (influence) of the $k$th variable. We prove that if we have $\psi_k(f) \le t$ for all $k$, then the threshold interval of $f$ has length $\displaystyle O \left(\frac {1}{\log (1/t)}\right)$. We also prove that if $f$ is balanced and $b_k(f) \le t$ for every $k$, then $\displaystyle \max_{k} \psi_k(f) \le O\left(\frac {\log \log (1/t)}{\log(1/t)}\right) $.</description>

      <title>Homology in Combinatorial Refraction Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we can project the graphical arrangement of $G$ to an $(n-1)$-dimensional torus to obtain a toric hyperplane arrangement. Adams, Defant, and Striker constructed a toric combinatorial refraction billiard system in which beams of light travel in the torus, refracting (with refraction coefficient $-1$) whenever they hit one of the toric hyperplanes in this toric arrangement. Each billiard trajectory in this system is periodic. We adopt a topological perspective and view the billiard trajectories as closed loops in the torus. We say $G$ is ensnaring if all of the billiard trajectories are contractible, and we say $G$ is expelling if none of the billiard trajectories is contractible. Our first main result states that a graph is expelling if and only if it is bipartite. We then provide several necessary conditions and several sufficient conditions for a graph to be ensnaring. For example, we show that the complement of an ensnaring graph cannot have a clique as a connected component. We also discuss ways to construct ensnaring graphs from other ensnaring graphs. For example, gluing two ensnaring graphs at a single vertex always yields another ensnaring graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Hypergraph Edge Modification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $F$, let $ex_F(G)$ denote the size of the largest $F$-free subgraph of $G$. Computing or estimating $ex_F(G)$ for various pairs $F,G$ is one of the central problems in extremal combinatorics. It is thus natural to ask how hard is it to compute this function. Motivated by an old problem of Yannakakis from the 80's, Alon, Shapira and Sudakov [ASS'09] proved that for every non-bipartite graph $F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Addressing a conjecture of Ailon and Alon (2007), we prove a hypergraph analogue of this theorem, showing that for every $k \geq 3$ and every non-$k$-partite $k$-graph $F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we conjecture that our hardness result can be extended to all $k$-graphs $F$ other than a matching of fixed size. If true, this would give a precise characterization of the $k$-graphs $F$ for which computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard, since we also prove that when $F$ is a matching of fixed size, $ex_F(G)$ is computable in polynomial time. This last result can be considered an algorithmic version of the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem.
  The proof of [ASS'09] relied on a variety of tools from extremal graph theory, one of them being Tur\'an's theorem. One of the main challenges we have to overcome in order to prove our hypergraph extension is the lack of a Tur\'an-type theorem for $k$-graphs. To circumvent this, we develop a completely new graph theoretic approach for proving such hardness results.</description>

      <title>Several combinatorial results generalized from one large subset of semigroups to infinitely many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Phulara established a generalization of the famous central set theorem by an original idea. Roughly speaking, this idea extends a combinatorial result from one large subset of the given semigroup to countably many. In this paper, we apply this idea to other combinatorial results to obtain corresponding generalizations, and do some further investigation. Moreover, we find that Phulara's generalization can be generalized further that can deal with uncountably many C-sets.</description>

Abstract: The Elliptic Somber and Euler Somber indices are newly defined topological indices based on the Somber index. Our paper presents calculations of the upper and lower bounds of these indices for the join and corona product of arbitrary graphs.

      <description>arXiv:2502.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called a nut graph if zero is its eigenvalue of multiplicity one and its corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. A graph is a bicirculant if it admits an automorphism with two equally sized vertex orbits. There are four classes of connected quartic bicirculant graphs. We classify the quartic bicirculant graphs that are nut graphs by investigating properties of each of these four classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a conjecture of Puder on an extension of the co-growth formula to any non-negative function defined on a bi-regular tree. A key component of our proof is the establishment of a resolvent identity, which serves as an operator version of the co-growth formula. We also provide a simpler proof of Puder's generalised co-growth formula for the regular tree.</description>

      <title>Congruences for hook lengths of partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan et al. proved congruences for the number of hooks of fixed even length among the set of self-conjugate partitions of an integer $n$, therefore answering positively a conjecture raised by Ballantine et al.. In this paper, we show how these congruences can be immediately derived and generalized from an addition theorem for self-conjugate partitions proved by the second author. We also recall how the addition theorem proved before by Han and Ji can be used to derive similar congruences for the whole set of partitions, which are originally due to Bessenrodt, and Bacher and Manivel. Finally, we extend such congruences to the set of $z$-asymmetric partitions defined by Ayyer and Kumari, by proving an addition-multiplication theorem for these partitions. Among other things, this contains as special cases the congruences for the number of hook lengths for the self-conjugate and the so-called doubled distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the cancellation of a critical pair on the (co-)boundary operator in discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Morse theory helps us compute the homology groups of simplicial complexes in an efficient manner. A "good" gradient vector field reduces the number of critical simplices, simplifying homology calculations by reducing them to the computation of homology groups of a simpler chain complex. This homology computation hinges on an efficient enumeration of gradient trajectories. The technique of cancelling pairs of critical simplices reduces the number of critical simplices, though it also perturbs the gradient trajectories. In this article, we provide an explicit formula for computing the modified boundary operators after cancelling a critical pair, in terms of the original boundary operators. Thus, it eliminates the need of enumeration of the new gradient trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define real origami (that is, origami equipped with a real structure) and enumerate them using the combinatorics of zonal polynomials. We explicitly express the numbers of genus 2 real origami with 2 simple zeros in terms of the sums of divisors, showing that their generating function is a quantum modular form. Furthermore, we show that replacing zonal polynomials with Schur polynomials we can effectively count the classical (complex) origami. As a by-product, we establish a connection between classical origami and a specific class of double Hurwitz numbers. Finally, we discuss some conjectures and open questions involving Jack functions, quantum modular forms, and integrable hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benjamini, Kalifa and Tzalik recently proved that there is an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that any graph with at most $c\cdot2^d/d$ edges and no isolated vertices is a minor of the $d$-dimensional hypercube $Q_d$, while there is an absolute constant $K &gt; 0$ such that $Q_d$ is not $(K\cdot2^d/\sqrt{d})$-minor-universal. We show that $Q_d$ does not contain 3-uniform expander graphs with $C\cdot2^d/d$ edges as minors. This matches the lower bound up to a constant factor and answers one of their questions.</description>

      <title>The Hajnal--Rothschild problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal F$ define $\nu(\mathcal F,t)$ as the largest $s$ for which there exist $A_1,\ldots, A_{s}\in \mathcal F$ such that for $i\ne j$ we have $|A_i\cap A_j|&lt; t$. What is the largest family $\mathcal F\subset{[n]\choose k}$ with $\nu(\mathcal F,t)\le s$? This question goes back to a paper Hajnal and Rothschild from 1973. We show that, for some absolute $C$ and $n&gt;2k+Ct^{4/5}s^{1/5}(k-t)\log_2^4n$, $n&gt;2k+Cs(k-t)\log_2^4 n$ the largest family with $\nu(\mathcal F,t)\le s$ has the following structure: there are sets $X_1,\ldots, X_s$ of sizes $t+2x_1,\ldots, t+2x_s$, such that for any $A\in \mathcal F$ there is $i\in [s]$ such that $|A\cap X_i|\ge t+x_i$. That is, the extremal constructions are unions of the extremal constructions in the Complete $t$-Intersection Theorem. For the proof, we enhance the spread approximation technique of Zakharov and the second author. In particular, we introduce the idea of iterative spread approximation.</description>

Abstract: The common information property and the existence of a tensor product with the uniform matroid of rank two on three elements are two different necessary conditions for a polymatroid to be linearly representable. Each of them implies the Ingleton's inequality, which is another necessary condition. Additional connections between those conditions are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Induced Disjoint Paths Without an Induced Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a new obstacle to the nascent algorithmic theory for classes excluding an induced minor. We indeed show that on the class of string graphs -- which avoids the 1-subdivision of, say, $K_5$ as an induced minor -- Induced 2-Disjoint Paths is NP-complete. So, while $k$-Disjoint Paths, for a fixed $k$, is polynomial-time solvable in general graphs, the absence of a graph as an induced minor does not make its induced variant tractable, even for $k=2$. This answers a question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov [SODA '24], and complements a polynomial-time algorithm for Induced $k$-Disjoint Paths in classes of bounded genus by Kobayashi and Kawarabayashi [SODA '09]. In addition to being string graphs, our produced hard instances are subgraphs of a constant power of bounded-degree planar graphs, hence have bounded twin-width and bounded maximum degree.
  We also leverage our new result to show that there is a fixed subcubic graph $H$ such that deciding if an input graph contains $H$ as an induced subdivision is NP-complete. Until now, all the graphs $H$ for which such a statement was known had a vertex of degree at least 4. This answers a question by Chudnovsky, Seymour, and the fourth author [JCTB '13], and by Le [JGT '19]. Finally we resolve another question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov by exhibiting a subcubic graph $H$ without two adjacent degree-3 vertices and such that deciding if an input $n$-vertex graph contains $H$ as an induced minor is NP-complete, and unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails, requires time $2^{\Omega(\sqrt n)}$. This complements an algorithm running in subexponential time $2^{O(n^{2/3} \log n)}$ by these authors [SODA '24] under the same technical condition.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Tropical split Jacobians of curves of genus 2 II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of two papers which study the phenomenon of tropical split Jacobians. The first paper is a contemplative study, embedded in the broader context of exploring connections between the category of tropical abelian varieties (tav), $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$, and the category of tropical curves, $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$. Tropical split Jacobians take on different forms depending on whether we look at them in $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$: They appear either as 2 dimensional tavs that decompose into a product of two elliptic curves, or as a pair of optimal coverings. [11] examines both and then focuses on how optimal covers give rise to split Jacobians. This paper takes a different approach. Instead of looking at the phenomenon as a whole, we analyze its building blocks, a pair of elliptic curves together with a finite subgroup of their product, and how to reassemble them into a Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Graph Products of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine three Rubik's Cubes arranged in a row, linked such that any move on the left or right cube also applies to the middle one, and moves on the middle cube affect all three simultaneously. If each cube is individually solvable, can all three be solved together in this configuration? This question motivates a natural generalization of the Lights Out Puzzle, exploring the synergy between graph theory and group theory.
  The classic Lights Out Puzzle is played on a $5 \times 5$ grid where each square is either "on" or "off." Clicking a square toggles its state and that of its neighbors, and the objective is to turn all squares "off." A related question, solvable using linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the finite field of 2 elements, asks which states are possible to achieve starting from the all-on state. Here, we vastly generalize the setting in two ways: (1) the states are allowed to be the elements of a group $G$, where "clicking" is done by selecting an element $g \in G$ and multiplying all affected squares on the right by $g$, and (2) we not only allow square grids, but any graph $\Gamma$, where clicking a vertex $v$ affects $v$ and all adjacent vertices.
  Starting with the identity element $e \in G$ for all vertices, the totality of all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^{\Gamma}$. This group generalizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure for analysis. For many graphs, which we term "RA" (reducible to abelian), the problem reduces - regardless of $G$ - to a linear algebra question over $\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers). We discuss a chain of five different subgroups consisting of commutators; the largest two are equal precisely when the graph is RA. Interestingly, while most graphs appear to be RA, we show the odd-dimensional cube graphs $Q_{2n+1}$ are not.</description>

Abstract: We use folding techniques to define a new class of gentle-like algebras that generalise the iterated tilted algebras of type $C$ and $\widetilde{C}$, which we call folded gentle algebras. We then show that folded gentle algebras satisfy many of the same remarkable properties of gentle algebras, and that the proof of these properties follows directly from folding arguments. In particular, we classify the indecomposable modules of folded gentle algebras in terms symmetric and asymmetric string and band modules. We classify the Auslander-Reiten sequences over these algebras, showing that irreducible morphisms between string modules are given by adding/deleting hooks and cohooks to/from strings. Finally, we show that the class of folded gentle algebras are closed under derived equivalence.</description>

      <title>A Coboundary Temperely-Lieb Category for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering a suitable renormalization of the Temperley--Lieb category, we study its specialization to the case $q=0$. Unlike the $q\neq 0$ case, the obtained monoidal category, $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$, is not rigid or braided. We provide a closed formula for the Jones--Wenzl projectors in $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and give semisimple bases for its endomorphism algebras. We explain how to obtain the same basis using the representation theory of finite inverse monoids, via the associated M\"obius inversion. We then describe a coboundary structure on $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and show that its idempotent completion is coboundary monoidally equivalent to the category of $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals. This gives a diagrammatic description of the commutor for $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals defined by Henriques and Kamnitzer and of the resulting action of the cactus group. We also study fiber functors of $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and discuss how they differ from the $q\neq 0$ case.</description>

Abstract: Let $A, B$ be subsets of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z})^2$. In this note, we provide conditions on the densities of $A$ and $B$ such that $|gA-B|\gg p^{2r}$ for a positive proportion of $g\in SO_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z})$. The conditions are sharp up to constant factors in the unbalanced case, and the proof makes use of tools from discrete Fourier analysis and results in restriction/extension theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <title>Hankel continued fractions and Hankel determinants for $q$-deformed metallic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix $n$ a positive integer. Take the $n$-th metallic number $\phi_n=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$ (e.g. $\phi_1$ is the golden number) and let $\Phi_n(q)$ be its $q$-deformation in the sense of S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko. This is an algebraic continued fraction which admits an expansion into a Taylor series around $q=0$, with integral coefficients. By using the notion of Hankel continued fraction introduced by the first author in 2016 we determine explicitly the first $n+2$ sequences of shifted Hankel determinants of $\Phi_n$ and show that they satisfy the following properties:
  1) They are periodic and consist of $-1,0,1$ only.
  2) They satisfy a three-term Gale-Robinson recurrence, i.e. they form discrete integrable dynamical systems.
  3) They are all completely determined by the first sequence.
  This article thus validates a conjecture formulated by V. Ovsienko and the second author in a recent paper and establishes new connections between $q$-deformations of real numbers and sequences of Catalan or Motzkin numbers.</description>

      <title>Maximum flow and self-avoiding walk on bunkbed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two combinatorial models on bunkbed graphs: maximum flow and self-avoiding walks. A bunkbed graph is defined as the Cartesian product $G\times K_2$, where $G$ is a finite graph and $K_2$ is the complete graph on two vertices, labelled $0$ and $1$. For the maximum flow problem, we show that if the bunkbed graph $G\times K_2$ has non-negative, reflection-symmetric edge capacities, then for any $u, v\in V(G)$, the maximum flow strength from $(u,0)$ to $(v,0)$ in $G\times K_2$ is at least as large as that from $(u,0)$ to $(v,1)$.
  For the self-avoiding walk model on a bunkbed graph $G\times K_2$, we investigate whether there are more self-avoiding walks from $(u,0)$ to $(v,1)$ than from $(u,0)$ to $(v,0)$. We prove that this holds when $G=K_n$ is a complete graph and $n$ is sufficiently large. Additionally, we provide examples where the statement does not holds and pose the question of whether it remains true when $\{u,v\}$ is not a cut-edge of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In 1994, Kac and Wakimoto found the denominator identity for classical affine Lie superalgebras, generalizing that for affine Lie algebras. As an application, they obtained power series identities for some powers of $\triangle(q)$, where $\triangle(q)$ is the generating function of triangular numbers. In this article, we give a different proof of one of their identities. The main step is to prove that a certain indefinite theta function involving spherical polynomials is actually a modular form. We use the technique recently developed by Roehrig and Zwegers.</description>

Abstract: We develop the technique of geometric realizations with algebraically independent (over the field of real algebraic numbers) coordinates of vertices and combine it with the oriented volume method inspired by work of McLennan and Tourky on the Sperner's lemma. This enables us to prove new results: the non-draw property of the generalized Y game, the theorem about triangulation of the product of two simplices, multilabeled Ky Fan' s lemma, and give new proofs of known results: the multilabeled version of Sperner's lemma and generalized Atanassov conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromatic symmetric functions are well-studied symmetric functions in algebraic combinatorics that generalize the chromatic polynomial and are related to Hessenberg varieties and diagonal harmonics. Motivated by the Stanley--Stembridge conjecture, we show that the allowable coloring weights for indifference graphs of Dyck paths are the lattice points of a permutahedron $\mathcal{P}_\lambda$, and we give a formula for the dominant weight $\lambda$. Furthermore, we conjecture that such chromatic symmetric functions are Lorentzian, a property introduced by Br\"and\'en and Huh as a bridge between discrete convex analysis and concavity properties in combinatorics, and we prove this conjecture for abelian Dyck paths. We extend our results on the Newton polytope to incomparability graphs of (3+1)-free posets, and we give a number of conjectures and results stemming from our work, including results on the complexity of computing the coefficients and relations with the $\zeta$ map from diagonal harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-Whittaker function $W_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q)$ associated to a partition $\lambda$ is a $q$-analogue of the Schur function $s_\lambda(\mathbf{x})$, and is defined as the $t=0$ specialization of the Macdonald polynomial $P_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q,t)$. We show combinatorially how to expand $W_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q)$ in terms of partial flags compatible with a nilpotent endomorphism over the finite field of size $1/q$. This yields an expression analogous to a well-known formula for the Hall-Littlewood functions. We show that considering pairs of partial flags and taking Jordan forms leads to a probabilistic bijection between nonnegative-integer matrices and pairs of semistandard tableaux of the same shape, proving the Cauchy identity for $q$-Whittaker functions. We call our probabilistic bijection the $q$-Burge correspondence, and prove that in the limit as $q\to 0$, we recover a description of the classical Burge correspondence (also known as column RSK) due to Rosso (2012). A key step in the proof is the enumeration of an arbitrary double coset of $\text{GL}_n$ modulo two parabolic subgroups, which we find to be of independent interest. As an application, we use the $q$-Burge correspondence to count isomorphism classes of certain modules over the preprojective algebra of a type $A$ quiver (i.e. a path), refined according to their socle filtrations. This develops a connection between the combinatorics of symmetric functions and the representation theory of preprojective algebras.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. Intuitively, DP-coloring generalizes list coloring by allowing the colors that are identified as the same to vary from edge to edge. Formally, DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal in an auxiliary structure called a DP-cover of $G$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of subpolytopes of the permutahedron that arise as the convex hulls of stack-sorting on permutations. We primarily focus on $Ln1$ permutations, i.e., permutations of length $n$ whose penultimate and last entries are $n$ and $1$, respectively. First, we present some enumerative results on $Ln1$ permutations. Then we show that the polytopes that arise from stack-sorting on $Ln1$ permutations are simplices and proceed to study their geometry and lattice-point enumeration. In addition, we pose questions and problems for further investigation. Particular focus is then taken on the $Ln1$ permutation $23\cdots n1$. We show that the convex hull of all its iterations through the stack-sorting algorithm shares the same lattice-point enumerator as that of the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit cube and lecture-hall simplex. Lastly, we detail some results on the real lattice-point enumerator for variations of the simplices arising from stack-sorting on the permutation $23\cdots n1$. This then allows us to show that those simplices are Gorenstein of index $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply operad theory to enumerative combinatorics in order to count the number of shuffles between series-parallel posets and chains. We work with three types of shuffles, two of them noncommutative, for example a left deck-divider shuffle $A$ between $P$ and $Q$ is a shuffle of the posets in which, on every maximal chain $m\subset A$, the minimum and maximum elements belong to $P$ and no two consecutive points of $Q$ appear consecutively on $m$. The number of left deck-divider shuffles of $P$ and $Q$ differ from the number of left deck-divider shuffles of $Q$ and $P$.
  The generating functions whose $n$ coefficient counts shuffles between a poset $P$ and $1&lt;2&lt;\cdots&lt;n$ are called shuffle series. We explain how shuffle series are isomorphic to order series as algebras over the operad of series parallel posets.
  The weak and strict order polynomials are well known in the literature. At the level of generating series, with the theory of sets with a negative number of elements, we introduce a third order series and prove a theorem in the style of Stanley's Reciprocity Theorem compatible with the structure of algebras over the operad of finite posets.
  We conclude by describing the relationship of our work with the combinatorial properties of the operadic tensor product of free trees operads.</description>

Abstract: A subset $M$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a mutual-visibility set if any two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $M$ ``see'' each other in $G$, that is, there exists a shortest $u,v$-path in $G$ that contains no elements of $M$ as internal vertices. The mutual-visibility number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest size of a mutual-visibility set in $G$. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Q_{n}$ be an $n$-dimensional hypercube. Cicerone, Fonso, Di Stefano, Navarra, and Piselli showed that $2^{n}/\sqrt{n}\leq\mu(Q_{n})\leq2^{n-1}$. In this paper, we prove that $\mu(Q_{n})&gt;0.186\cdot2^n$ and thus establish that $\mu(Q_{n})=\Theta(2^{n})$.
  We also consider the chromatic mutual-visibility number, $\chi_{\mu}(G)$, that is the smallest number of colors used on vertices of $G$, such that every color class is a mutual-visibility set. Klav\v{z}ar, Kuziak, Valenzuela-Tripodoro, and Yero asked whether it is true that $\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(1)$. We answer their question in the negative by showing that $\omega(1)=\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(\log\log{n})$.
  Finally, we study the so-called total mutual-visibility number of graphs and give asymptotically tight bounds on this parameter for hypercubes.</description>

Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the universal compositional and multiplicative inversion formulas for the formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>

      <title>Typical Ramsey properties of the primes, abelian groups and other discrete structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ with integer entries, a subset $S$ of an abelian group and $r \in \mathbb N$, we say that $S$ is $(A,r)$-Rado if any $r$-colouring of $S$ yields a monochromatic solution to the system of equations $Ax=0$. A classical result of Rado characterises all those matrices $A$ such that $\mathbb N$ is $(A,r)$-Rado for all $r \in \mathbb N$. R\"odl and Ruci\'nski and Friedgut, R\"odl and Schacht proved a random version of Rado's theorem where one considers a random subset of $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ instead of $\mathbb N$.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous random Ramsey problem in the more general setting of abelian groups. Given a sequence $(S_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of finite subsets of abelian groups, let $S_{n,p}$ be a random subset of $S_n$ obtained by including each element of $S_n$ independently with probability $p$. We are interested in determining the probability threshold $\hat p:=\hat p(n)$ such that
  $$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb P [ S_{n,p} \text{ is } (A,r)\text{-Rado}]= \begin{cases} 0 &amp;\text{ if } p=o(\hat p); \\ 1 &amp;\text{ if } p=\omega(\hat p). \end{cases}$$
  Our main result, which we coin the random Rado lemma, is a general black box to tackle problems of this type. Using this tool in conjunction with a series of supersaturation results, we determine the probability threshold for a number of different cases. A consequence of the Green-Tao theorem is the van der Waerden theorem for the primes: every finite colouring of the primes contains arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Using our machinery, we obtain a random version of this result. We also prove a novel supersaturation result for $S_n:=[n]^d$ and use it to prove an integer lattice generalisation of the random version of Rado's theorem. Various threshold results for abelian groups are also given.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of closed neighborhood corona product of graph and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the closed neighborhood corona product of graphs, which was introduced by Harishchandra S. Ramane et al.~\cite{ramane2021polynomials} (cf. Polynomials Associated with Closed Neighborhood Corona and Neighborhood Complement Corona of Graphs). Based on their results, such as characteristic polynomials of the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian matrices, we further investigate the spectral characteristics of this product graph. Specifically, we investigate conditions under which cospectrality occurs for this operation. Further, we determine the Kirchhoff index and count spanning trees and identify sequences of non-cospectral equienergetic product graphs. Finally, we develop criteria for when the product graph is integral and thereby contribute to a deeper understanding of the algebraic and combinatorial structure of the product graph.</description>

      <title>Separating hypergraph Tur\'an densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the Tur\'an densities of hypergraphs is a notoriously difficult problem at the core of combinatorics. Although Tur\'an posed this problem in 1941, $\pi(K_{\ell}^{(k)})$ remains unknown for all $\ell&gt;k\geq 3$. Prior to this work, it was not even known whether $\pi(K_{\ell}^{(k)})&lt;\pi(K_{\ell+1}^{(k)})$ holds for general $\ell$ and $k$, and the best-known bounds on $\pi(K_{\ell}^{(k)})$ are far from implying anything close to this. We prove that $\pi(K_{\ell}^{(k)})&lt;\pi(K_{\ell+1}^{(k)})$, for all $\ell&gt;k\geq 3$, and provide a general criterion to distinguish the Tur\'an densities of two hypergraphs. As a corollary, we obtain that $\pi(K_{k+1}^{(k)})&lt;\pi(K_{k+2}^{(k)-})$, for all $k\geq 3$. For $k=3$, this was previously proved by Markstr\"om, answering a question by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>A note on the mutual-visibility coloring of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $M$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a mutual-visibility set if for any two vertices $u,v\in{M}$ there exists a shortest $u$-$v$ path in $G$ that contains no elements of $M$ as internal vertices. Let $\chi_{\mu}(G)$ be the least number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$, so that each color class is a mutual-visibility set. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Q_{n}$ be an $n$-dimensional hypercube. It has been shown that the maximum size of a mutual-visibility set in $Q_{n}$ is at least $\Omega(2^{n})$. Klav\v{z}ar, Kuziak, Valenzuela-Tripodoro, and Yero further asked whether it is true that $\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(1)$. In this note we answer their question in the negative by showing that $$\omega(1)=\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(\log\log{n}).$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and that the bound is tight for each $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. This extends the results known for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improves the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524[math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answers a question of Ju and the third author [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and partially answers a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Hypercube minor-universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $m$-minor-universal if every graph with at most $m$ edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of $G$. We prove that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, $Q_d$, is $\Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right)$-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant $C &gt;0$ such that $Q_d$ is not $\frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}}$-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. A key component of our proof is the following claim regarding the decomposition of a permutation of a box into simpler, one-dimensional permutations: Let $n_1, \dots, n_d$ be positive integers, and define $X := [n_1] \times \dots \times [n_d]$. We prove that every permutation $\sigma: X \to X$ can be expressed as $\sigma = \sigma_1 \circ \dots \circ \sigma_{2d-1}$, where each $\sigma_i$ is a one-dimensional permutation, meaning it fixes all coordinates except possibly one. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>

Abstract: A family of sets is intersecting if every pair of its members has an element in common. Such a family of sets is called a star if some element is in every set of the family. Given a graph $G$, let $\mu(G)$ denote the size of the smallest maximal independent set of $G$. In 2005, Holroyd and Talbot conjectured the following generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem: if $1\le r\le \mu(G)/2$ then there is an intersecting family of independent $r$-sets of maximum size that is a star. In this paper we present the history of this conjecture and survey the results that have supported it over the last 20 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz et al. proved that every $6$-edge-connected graph has a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. In fact, they proved a more technical statement which says that there exists a nowhere zero $3$-flow that extends the flow prescribed on the incident edges of a single vertex $z$ with bounded degree. We extend this theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al. to allow $z$ to have arbitrary degree, but with the additional assumption that there is another vertex $x$ with large degree and no small cut separating $x$ and $z$. Using this theorem, we prove two results regarding the generation of minimal graphs with the property that prescribing the edges incident to a vertex with specific flow does not extend to a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. We use this to further strengthen the theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al., as well as make progress on a conjecture of Li et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00943v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of biclosed sets in an irreducible root system of type $A_n$ and the set of quasitrivial semigroup structures on a set with $n+1$ elements. Inspired by this correspondence, we first generalize this bijection to give a semigroup structural characterization of the biclosed sets in a standard parabolic subset. Secondly, we define an index for an arbitrary subset of the root system of type $A_n$ which measures how far it is from being biclosed. We show that such an index equals to the associativity index of the associated quasitrivial magma. Thirdly, we define type $B_n$ quasitrivial semigroups which are in bijective with the type $B_n$ biclosed sets. Finally, we use the identification of certain biclosed sets with total preorders to give a purely combinatorial proof that a root system of type $A$ has an oriented matroid structure.</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying proof to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our proof works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. Our main technical contribution is to establish a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees so that we are able to handle zero-free regions of the three different parameters $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ in a unified way. We use Riemann mapping theorem to deal with zere-free regions of arbitrary shapes.
  Our result comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain novel SSM properties for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our result to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM property and two new forms of spatial mixing property, namely plus and minus spatial mixing for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>

      <title>A Unified FPT Framework for Crossing Number Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic (and traditional) crossing number problem is to determine the minimum number of crossings in a topological drawing of an input graph in the plane. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that yields fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for many generalized crossing number problems in the plane and on surfaces.
  Our main result takes the following form. We fix a surface S, an integer r, and a map \kappa from the set of topological drawings of graphs in S to the nonnegative integers, essentially describing which types of drawings we accept and how we want to count the crossings in them. Then deciding whether a graph G has a drawing D on S with \kappa(D)&lt;=r can be done in time quadratic in the size of G. More generally, we may take as input an edge-colored graph, and distinguish crossings by the colors of the involved edges; and we may allow to perform a bounded number of edge removals and vertex splits to G before drawing it. The proof is a reduction to the embeddability of a graph on a two-dimensional simplicial complex, which admits an FPT algorithm by a result of Colin de Verdi\`ere and Magnard [ESA 2021].
  As a direct consequence, we obtain, in a unified way, FPT algorithms for many established topological crossing number variants, including, e.g., fixed-rotation and color-constrained ones. While some of these variants already had previously published FPT algorithms, for many of them we obtain algorithms with a better runtime. Moreover, our framework applies to drawings in any fixed surface and, for instance, solves the natural surface generalizations of k-planar, k-quasi-planar, min-k-planar, and k-gap crossing numbers, as well as the joint and the edge crossing numbers, the skewness, and the splitting number in surfaces, all of which except the splitting number have not been handled in surfaces other than the plane yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus leading asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus asymptotics. We also propose, with extensive numerical data, several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

Abstract: Exponentiation of Hamiltonians refers to a mathematical operation to a Hamiltonian operator, typically in the form e^(-i.t.H), where H is the Hamiltonian and t is a time parameter. This operation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, particularly to evolve quantum systems over time according to the Schrodinger equation.
  In quantum algorithms, such as Adiabatic methods and QAOA, exponentiation enables efficient simulation of a system dynamics.
  It involves constructing quantum circuits that approximate this exponential operation. When H=\sum_(p=1)^n H_p , each H_p is defined using the Pauli operator basis, which includes the well-known X, Y, Z and Id gates, i.e., H_p=U_1\otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n and U_k\in{Id,X,Y,Z}. In this article, we explore the exponentiation of H_p, specifically e^(-i.t.U_1 \otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n ), by introducing an algorithmic approach. We demonstrate a straightforward and efficient method to construct compact circuits that are easy to implement.</description>
