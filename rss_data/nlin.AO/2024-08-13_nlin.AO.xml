      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency combs significantly spanned to broad bandwidths by an optomechanical resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency comb, as a spectrum made of discrete and equally spaced spectral lines, is a light source with essential applications in modern technology. Cavity optomechanical systems were found to be a feasible candidate for realizing on-chip frequency comb with low repetition rate. However, it was difficult to increase the comb line numbers of this type of frequency combs because the mechanical oscillation amplitude of such system, which determines the frequency comb bandwidth, cannot quickly increase with pump laser power. Here, we develop a new approach to generate broadband optomechanical frequency comb by employing a different mechanism to enhance the mechanical oscillation. Two pump tones with their frequency difference matching the mechanical frequency will drive the system into a self-organized nonlinear resonance and thus tremendously transfer the energy to the mechanical resonator. As a result, more than $10000$ or even more comb lines become available under the pump laser power in the order of milliwatt. A unique feature of the self-organized resonance is the mechanical frequency locking so that, within a certain range of the frequency difference between two drive tones, the distance between comb teeth can be locked by the two drive tones and becomes independent of any change of pump power. This property guarantees a stable repetition rate of the generated frequency comb.</description>
