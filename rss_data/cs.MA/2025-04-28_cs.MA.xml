      <title>Collaborating Action by Action: A Multi-agent LLM Framework for Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning.

      <title>Can We Govern the Agent-to-Agent Economy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current approaches to AI governance often fall short in anticipating a future where AI agents manage critical tasks, such as financial operations, administrative functions, and beyond. While cryptocurrencies could serve as the foundation for monetizing value exchange in a collaboration and delegation dynamic among AI agents, a critical question remains: how can humans ensure meaningful oversight and control as a future economy of AI agents scales and evolves? In this philosophical exploration, we highlight emerging concepts in the industry to inform research and development efforts in anticipation of a future decentralized agentic economy.</description>

      <title>PreGSU-A Generalized Traffic Scene Understanding Model for Autonomous Driving based on Pre-trained Graph Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene understanding, defined as learning, extraction, and representation of interactions among traffic elements, is one of the critical challenges toward high-level autonomous driving (AD). Current scene understanding methods mainly focus on one concrete single task, such as trajectory prediction and risk level evaluation. Although they perform well on specific metrics, the generalization ability is insufficient to adapt to the real traffic complexity and downstream demand diversity. In this study, we propose PreGSU, a generalized pre-trained scene understanding model based on graph attention network to learn the universal interaction and reasoning of traffic scenes to support various downstream tasks. After the feature engineering and sub-graph module, all elements are embedded as nodes to form a dynamic weighted graph. Then, four graph attention layers are applied to learn the relationships among agents and lanes. In the pre-train phase, the understanding model is trained on two self-supervised tasks: Virtual Interaction Force (VIF) modeling and Masked Road Modeling (MRM). Based on the artificial potential field theory, VIF modeling enables PreGSU to capture the agent-to-agent interactions while MRM extracts agent-to-road connections. In the fine-tuning process, the pre-trained parameters are loaded to derive detailed understanding outputs. We conduct validation experiments on three datasets and two downstream tasks, i.e., trajectory prediction in urban scenario and intention recognition in highway scenario, to verify the model's generalization and understanding capabilities. Results show that compared with single-task-driven baselines, PreGSU achieves competitive performance on all datasets and downstream tasks, indicating its potential to be generalized to various scenes and targets. Ablation study shows the effectiveness of pre-train task design.</description>

      <title>Symmetries-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.</description>
