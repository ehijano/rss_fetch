      <title>Explicit Symplectic Integrators for Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Binary Mixture of Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit integrators for massive point vortex dynamics in binary mixture of Bose--Einstein condensates proposed by Richaud et al. The integrators are symplectic and preserve the angular momentum of the system exactly. Our main focus is the small-mass regime in which the minor component of the binary mixture comprises a very small fraction of the total mass. The solution behaviors in this regime change significantly depending on the initial momenta: they are highly oscillatory unless the momenta satisfy certain conditions. The standard Runge--Kutta method performs very poorly in preserving the Hamiltonian showing a significant drift in the long run, especially for highly oscillatory solutions. On the other hand, our integrators nearly preserve the Hamiltonian without drifts. We also give an estimate of the error in the Hamiltonian by finding an asymptotic expansion of the modified Hamiltonian for our 2nd-order integrator.</description>

      <title>Stable supersolids and boselets in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the stability of supersolid striped waves, plane-wave boselets, and other extended states in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive three-body interactions (R3BIs), modeled by quintic terms in the framework of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the absence of R3BIs, the extended states are susceptible to the modulational instability (MI) induced by the cubic attractive nonlinearity. Using the linearized Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we identify multiple new types of MI, including baseband, passband, mixedband, and zero-wavenumber-gain ones, which give rise to deterministic rogue waves and complex nonlinear wave patterns. Our analysis reveals that R3BIs eliminate baseband and zero-wavenumber-gain MIs, forming, instead, phonon modes that enable stable boselets. Additionally, mixedband and passband MIs are suppressed, which results in a lattice-like phonon-roton mode that supports a stable supersolid phase. These stable supersolids can be realized using currently available ultracold experimental setup.</description>

      <title>One dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with long range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha &lt;3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha&lt;2$, and for $2&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.</description>

      <title>Dynamic formation of supersolid phase in a mixture of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamical properties of a mixture consisting of a dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. In particular, we focus on the system's response to a temporal variation in the interaction strength between bosons and fermions. When the interspecies attraction becomes sufficiently strong, we observe a phase transition to a supersolid state. This conclusion is supported by the emergence of an out-of-phase Goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Phase stabilization and phase tuning of an optical lattice with a variable period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the resonant spin response of a stirred polariton condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the enhancement of the spin coherence time (T2) by almost an order-of-magnitude in exciton-polariton condensates through driven spin precession resonance. Using a rotating optical trap formed by a bichromatic laser excitation, we synchronize the trap stirring frequency with the condensate intrinsic Larmor precession, achieving an order of magnitude increase in spin coherence. By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width. Here we present a theoretical model that explains our experimental findings in terms of the mutual synchronization of the condensate circular polarization components. Our findings underpin the potential of polariton condensates for spinoptronic devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Novel Experimental Platform to realize One-dimensional Quantum Fluids</title>

Abstract: Templated porous materials, such as MCM-41, due to the uniformity of their onedimensional structure and scalability in synthesis, have emerged as an attractive medium for studying one-dimensional quantum fluids. However, the experimental challenge of synthesizing these materials with pore radii smaller than 15 Angstroms hinders the realization of a one-dimensional quantum liquid of helium within such systems, as the coherence length of helium is shorter than the pore radius. Recently, DelMaestro et. al. have preplated MCM-41 with Ar resulting in a reduction of the pore size and a softening of the adsorption potential allowing them to observe 1D Tomanga-Luttinger liquid like behavior. In this paper we present a novel method to obtain an even more ideal environment for studying the behavior of 1D 4He. We propose preplating MCM-41 pores with cesium (Cs) metal. The non-wetting nature of helium on a Cs-coated surface, coupled with the large atomic radius of cesium, creates an optimal environment for confining a quantum liquid of helium in one-dimensional geometry. We present preliminary measurements of adsorption isotherms and Small Angle X-ray Scattering studies that 1reveal a reduction in pore radius upon preplating MCM-41 with Cs, demonstrating promising prospects for facilitating the realization of one-dimensional quantum fluids in templated porous materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Emergent supercounterfluid and quantum phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment that realizes nearest-neighbor dipolar couplings in an optical lattice [C. Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2&lt;\rho_B&lt;1$. Our work paves the way for realizing exotic many-body phases in cold atom experiments upon proper tuning of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.</description>

Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>
