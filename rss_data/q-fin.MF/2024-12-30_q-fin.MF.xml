      <title>The System of BSDEs with Singular Terminal Values Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an optimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and with singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time. The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely minimal solutions established in most related literature.</description>

      <title>Travelling wave solutions of an equation of Harry Dym type arising in the Black-Scholes framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes framework is crucial in pricing a vast number of financial instruments that permeate the complex dynamics of world markets. Associated with this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x, {\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\partial_x^2 -\partial_x)$ that carries a variable volatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$ and a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility model. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find a non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a time-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the Harry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave solutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and integrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent structures in financial-market volatility studies.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semilinear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>

      <title>DeFi Arbitrage in Hedged Liquidity Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirically, the prevailing market prices for liquidity tokens of the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- as offered in practice by companies such as Uniswap -- readily permit arbitrage opportunities by delta hedging the risk of the position. Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by treating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.</description>
