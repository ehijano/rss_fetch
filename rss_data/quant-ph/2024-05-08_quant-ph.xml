      <title>Kirkwood-Dirac representations beyond quantum states (and their relation to noncontextuality)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirkwood-Dirac representations of quantum states are increasingly finding use in many areas within quantum theory. Usually, representations of this sort are only applied to provide a representation of quantum states (as complex functions over some set). We show how standard Kirkwood-Dirac representations can be extended to a fully compositional representation of all of quantum theory (including channels, measurements and so on), and prove that this extension satisfies the essential features of functoriality (namely, that the representation commutes with composition of channels), linearity, and quasistochasticity. Interestingly, the representation of a POVM element is uniquely picked out to be the collection of weak values for it relative to the bases defining the representation. We then prove that if one can find any Kirkwood-Dirac representation that is everywhere real and nonnegative for a given experimental scenario or fragment of quantum theory, then the scenario or fragment is consistent with the principle of generalized noncontextuality, a key notion of classicality in quantum foundations. We also show that the converse does not hold: even if one verifies that all Kirkwood-Dirac representations (as defined herein) of an experiment require negativity or imaginarity, one cannot generally conclude that the experiment witnesses contextuality.</description>

      <title>Complex Scaling Method applied to the study of the Swanson Hamiltonian in the broken PT-symmetry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the non-PT symmetry phase of the Swanson Hamiltonian in the framework of the Complex Scaling Method. By constructing a bi-orthogonality relation, we apply the formalism of the response function to analyse the time evolution of different initial wave packages. The Wigner Functions and mean value of operators are evaluated as a function of time. We analyse in detail the time evolution in the neighbourhood of Exceptional Points. We derive a continuity equation for the system. We compare the results obtained using the Complex Scaling Method to the ones obtained by working in a Rigged Hilbert Space.</description>

      <title>Arrival Times Versus Detection Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to compute the probability distribution of a detection time, i.e., of the time which a detector registers as the arrival time of a quantum particle, is a long-debated problem. In this regard, Bohmian mechanics provides in a straightforward way the distribution of the time at which the particle actually does arrive at a given surface in 3-space in the absence of detectors. However, as we discuss here, since the presence of detectors can change the evolution of the wave function and thus the particle trajectories, it cannot be taken for granted that the arrival time of the Bohmian trajectories in the absence of detectors agrees with the one in the presence of detectors, and even less with the detection time. In particular, we explain why certain distributions that Das and D\"urr [arXiv:1802.07141] presented as the distribution of the detection time in a case with spin, based on assuming that all three times mentioned coincide, is actually not what Bohmian mechanics predicts.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Correlated Charge Noise in Superconducting Qubits at an Underground Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4$\pi$ coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly eight higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dips in Entangling Power of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The salient feature of both classical and quantum gravity is its universal and attractive character. However, less is known about the behaviour and build-up of quantum correlations when quantum systems interact via graviton exchange. In this work, we show that quantum correlations can remain strongly suppressed for certain choices of parameters even when considering two adjacent quantum systems in delocalized states. Using the framework of linearized quantum gravity with post-Newtonian contributions, we find that there are special values of delocalization where gravitationally induced entanglement drops to negligible values, albeit non-vanishing. We find a pronounced cancellation point far from the Planck scale, where the system tends towards classicalization. In addition, we show that quantum correlations begin to reemerge for large and tiny delocalizations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the universal coupling of gravity to the energy-momentum tensor, forming a valley of gravitational entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with atomic, molecular, and optical platforms for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics has been at the forefront of the development of quantum science while laying the foundation for modern technology. With the growing capabilities of quantum control of many atoms for engineered many-body states and quantum entanglement, a key question emerges: what critical impact will the second quantum revolution with ubiquitous applications of entanglement bring to bear on fundamental physics?
  In this Essay, we argue that a compelling long-term vision for fundamental physics and novel applications is to harness the rapid development of quantum information science to define and advance the frontiers of measurement physics, with strong potential for fundamental discoveries.
  As quantum technologies, such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and entangled quantum sensor networks, become much more advanced than today's realization, we wonder what doors of basic science can these tools unlock? We anticipate that some of the most intriguing and challenging problems, such as quantum aspects of gravity, fundamental symmetries, or new physics beyond the minimal standard model, will be tackled at the emerging quantum measurement frontier.</description>

      <title>Sensing Out-of-Equilibrium and Quantum Non-Gaussian environments via induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking on the quantum-probe dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing quantum sensing tools for investigating systems at atomic and nanoscales is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. While numerous protocols employ quantum probes to extract information from stationary or weakly coupled environments, the challenges intensify at atomic- and nano-scales where the environment is inherently out-of-equilibrium or strongly coupled with the sensor. We here prove that the time-reversal symmetry in the quantum-sensor control dynamics is broken, when partial information is probed from an environment that is out-of-equilibrium with non stationary fluctuations or is described by quantum non-Gaussian, strongly coupled environmental correlations. We exploit this phenomenon as a quantum sensing paradigm with proof-of principle experimental quantum simulations using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This introduces a signal contrast on a qubit-probe that quantifies how far the sensed environment is from equilibrium or its quantum non-Gaussian nature. Protocols are also presented to discern and filter a variety of environmental properties including stationary, non-stationary and non-Gaussian quantum noise fluctuations as a step toward sensing the ubiquitous environments of a quantum-sensor at atomic and nanoscales.</description>

      <title>Moments based entanglement criteria and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a key role in quantum computation and quantum information processing. It is of great significance to find efficient and experimentally friend separability criteria to detect entanglement. In this paper, we firstly propose two easily used entanglement criteria based on matrix moments. The first entanglement criterion only uses the first two realignment moments of a density matrix. The second entanglement criterion is based on the moments related to the partially transposed matrix. By detailed examples we illustrate the effectiveness of these criteria in detecting entanglement. Moreover, we provide an experimentally measurable lower bound of concurrence based on these moments. Finally, we present both bipartite and genuine tripartite entanglement measures based on the moments of the reduced states. By detailed examples, we show that our entanglement measures characterize the quantum entanglement in a more fine ways than the existing measures.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature photonic quantum computing in integrated silicon photonics with germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most, if not all, photonic quantum computing (PQC) relies upon superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on Nb operated at a temperature &lt; 4 K. This paper proposes and analyzes 300 K Si-waveguide-integrated GeSi single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on the recently demonstrated normal-incidence GeSi SPADs operated at room temperature, and shows that their performance is competitive against that of SNSPDs in a series of metrics for PQC with a reasonable time-gating window to resolve the issue of dark-count rate (DCR). These GeSi SPADs become photon-number-resolving avalanche diodes (PNRADs) by deploying a spatially multiplexed M-fold-waveguide array of M SPADs. Using on-chip waveguided spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) sources and waveguided field-programmable interferometer mesh (FPIM) circuits, together with the high-metric SPADs and PNRADs, high-performance quantum computing at room temperature is predicted for this PQC architecture.</description>

      <title>Practical and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing leverages quantum systems to solve complex computational tasks with unprecedented efficiency and reduced energy consumption. This paper presents a novel QRC framework utilizing a quantum optical reservoir composed of two-level atoms within a single-mode optical cavity. Employing the Jaynes-Cummings and Tavis-Cummings models, we introduce a scalable and practically measurable reservoir that outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing. We evaluate the reservoir's performance through two primary tasks: the prediction of time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant enhancements in performance with increased numbers of atoms, supported by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. This study confirms the potential of QRC to offer a scalable and efficient solution for advanced computational challenges, marking a significant step forward in the integration of quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

      <title>Cost of Locally Approximating High-Dimensional Ground States of Contextual Quantum Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality, one of the strongest forms of quantum correlations, delineates the quantum world and the classical one. It has been shown recently that some quantum models, in the form of infinite one-dimensional translation-invariant Hamiltonians with nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, have the lowest ground state energy density allowed in quantum physics. However, these models all have local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, making the study of their ground state behavior difficult on current qubit-based variational quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we focus on the cost of simulating the local approximations of ground states of these models using qubit-based parameterized quantum circuits. The local approximations, which are 3-site reduced density matrices with local Hilbert space dimension three, are purified then encoded into permutation-symmetric qubits. We develop a universal set of permutation-symmetry preserving qubit-based gates, using them as an ansatz to simulate parameterized quantum circuits designed for qutrits. These techniques allow us to assess the accuracy of simulating the purified local ground states with respect to a fixed amount of classical and quantum resources. We found that given the same quantum circuit and the number of iterations, more contextual ground states with lower energy density are easier to simulate.</description>

      <title>Boosted Imaginary Time Evolution of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the imaginary time evolution of matrix product states. We present a novel quantum-inspired classical method that, when combined with time evolving block decimation (TEBD), is able to potentially speed-up the convergence to a ground state compared to TEBD alone. Our method, referred to as boosted imaginary time evolution, relies on the use of reflections to boost to lower energy states. Interleaving TEBD steps with boosts reduces the total number of TEBD steps and potentially the computational cost required to imaginary time evolve a matrix product state to a ground state. We give the mathematical details of the method followed by an algorithmic implementation and finally some results for a simple test case.</description>

      <title>Locally-Measured R\'enyi Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the classical R\'enyi divergences to quantum states through an optimization over probability distributions induced by restricted sets of measurements. In particular, we define the notion of locally-measured R\'enyi divergences, where the set of allowed measurements originates from variants of locality constraints between (distant) parties $A$ and $B$. We then derive variational bounds on the locally-measured R\'enyi divergences and systematically discuss when these bounds become exact characterizations. As an application, we evaluate the locally-measured R\'enyi divergences on variants of highly symmetric data-hiding states, showcasing the reduced distinguishing power of locality-constrained measurements. For $n$-fold tensor powers, we further employ our variational formulae to derive corresponding additivity results, which gives the locally-measured R\'enyi divergences operational meaning as optimal rate exponents in asymptotic locally-measured hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of $d$-level systems on qubit-based quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum simulators are primarily qubit-based, making them naturally suitable for simulating 2-level quantum systems. However, many systems in nature are inherently $d$-level, including higher spins, bosons, vibrational modes, and itinerant electrons. To simulate $d$-level systems on qubit-based quantum simulators, an encoding method is required to map the $d$-level system onto a qubit basis. Such mapping may introduce illegitimate states in the Hilbert space which makes the simulation more sophisticated. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to address the illegitimate states. In addition, we compare two different mappings, namely binary and symmetry encoding methods, and compare their performance through variational simulation of the ground state and time evolution of various many-body systems. While binary encoding is very efficient with respect to the number of qubits it cannot easily incorporate the symmetries of the original Hamiltonian in its circuit design. On the other hand, the symmetry encoding facilitates the implementation of symmetries in the circuit design, though it comes with an overhead for the number of qubits. Our analysis shows that the symmetry encoding significantly outperforms the binary encoding, despite requiring extra qubits. Their advantage is indicated by requiring fewer two-qubit gates, converging faster, and being far more resilient to Barren plateaus. We have performed variational ground state simulations of spin-1, spin-3/2, and bosonic systems as well as variational time evolution of spin-1 systems. Our proposal can be implemented on existing quantum simulators and its potential is extendable to a broad class of physical models.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a Heron superconducting quantum processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum processors can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Improved Decoy-state and Flag-state Squashing Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an improved analysis for decoy-state methods, enhancing both achievable key rates and recovering analytical results for the single intensity scenario. Our primary focus is improving the shortcomings observed in current decoy-state methods, particularly recovering results when employing no decoy intensities. Our methods enable the continuous interpolation across varying numbers of intensity settings. Additionally, we extend decoy-state techniques to encompass scenarios where intensities vary depending on the signal state, thereby relaxing the constraints on experimental implementations. Our findings demonstrate that a minimum of two intensities are sufficient for high asymptotic secret key rates, thereby further softening experimental requirements. Additionally, we address inherent imperfections within detection setups like imperfect beamsplitters. We derive provable secure lower bounds on the subspace population estimation, which is required for certain squashing methods such as the flag-state squasher. These analytical bounds allow us to encompass arbitrary passive linear optical setups, and together with intensities varying with each signal state, lets us include a broad class of experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum materials combine the rich many-body physics of condensed matter systems with strong coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field, which presents both novel prospects and intricate challenges. One is often interested in the properties of one specific aspect of the material, e.g. the electronic many-body dynamics, subject to a structured bath of phononic and photonic modes. Open quantum systems featuring non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) but their usage of the system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to reach a consistent and rigorous description of open many-body systems and their quantum dynamics. We demonstrate first the strength and limitations of this stacked hierarchy for superradiant emission and spin-squeezing of established quantum optical models before presenting its full potential for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we explicitly simulate the impact of charge noise on the dynamic of the Fermi-Hubbard model subject to a structured bath comprising cavity and vibro-phononic environment. Strong optical coupling not only modifies the dynamic of the many-body system but serves furthermore as measurement channel providing information about the correlated motion imprinted by charge noise. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier transforms and fast Wigner and Weyl functions in large quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two methods for fast Fourier transforms are used in a quantum context. The first method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space $D=d^n$ with $d$ an odd integer, and is inspired by the Cooley-Tukey formalism. The `large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of $n$ `small Fourier transforms' (together with some other transforms) in quantum systems with $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Limitations of the method are discussed. In some special cases, the $n$ Fourier transforms can be performed in parallel. The second method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space $D=d_0...d_{n-1}$ with $d_0,...,d_{n-1}$ odd integers coprime to each other. It is inspired by the Good formalism, which in turn is based on the Chinese reminder theorem. In this case also the `large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of $n$ `small Fourier transforms' (that involve some constants related to the number theory that describes the formalism). The `small Fourier transforms' can be performed in a classical computer or in a quantum computer (in which case we have the additional well known advantages of quantum Fourier transform circuits). In the case that the small Fourier transforms are performed with a classical computer, complexity arguments for both methods show the reduction in computational time from ${\cal O}(D^2)$ to ${\cal O}(D\log D)$. The second method is also used for the fast calculation of Wigner and Weyl functions, in quantum systems with large finite dimension of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization through the interference blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization manifests itself in oscillators adjusting their frequencies and phases with respect to an external signal or another oscillator. In the quantum case, new features appear such as destructive interferences that can result in the suppression of phase locking. A three-level (spin-1) oscillator with equal gain and damping rates and subject to an external drive does not exhibit any 1:1 phase locking but 2:1 phase locking, i.e., its phase distribution features two maxima. This bistable locking at two opposite phases is a signature of the quantum interference synchronization blockade. An analogous behavior was found for two identical coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we consider two coupled spin-1 oscillators and a drive applied to the first spin. This leads to two interference blockades between the drive and the first spin as well as between both spins. Although both interference blockades persist for strong drive and coupling strengths, remarkably, the undriven spin does show a 1:1 phase locking to the external drive. The magnitude of the locking is proportional to the drive strength if the drive strength is small. In other words, the undriven oscillator synchronizes to the external drive through both interference blockades while the blockades persist. For a chain of three coupled spin-1 oscillators, we find synchronization between the first and third spins mediated via the blockaded, second spin.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate on the recent proposal of employing unitary operators in Quantum Mechanics.

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accelerate the process of materials design, materials science has increasingly used data driven techniques to extract information from collected data. Specially, machine learning (ML) algorithms, which span the ML discipline, have demonstrated ability to predict various properties of materials with the level of accuracy similar to explicit calculation of quantum mechanical theories, but with significantly reduced run time and computational resources. Within ML, graph neural networks have emerged as an important algorithm within the field of machine learning, since they are capable of predicting accurately a wide range of important physical, chemical and electronic properties due to their higher learning ability based on the graph representation of material and molecular descriptors through the aggregation of information embedded within the graph. In parallel with the development of state of the art classical machine learning applications, the fusion of quantum computing and machine learning have created a new paradigm where classical machine learning model can be augmented with quantum layers which are able to encode high dimensional data more efficiently. Leveraging the structure of existing algorithms, we developed a unique and novel gradient free hybrid quantum classical convoluted graph neural network (HyQCGNN) to predict formation energies of perovskite materials. The performance of our hybrid statistical model is competitive with the results obtained purely from a classical convoluted graph neural network, and other classical machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost. Consequently, our study suggests a new pathway to explore how quantum feature encoding and parametric quantum circuits can yield drastic improvements of complex ML algorithm like graph neural network.</description>

      <title>Restricted Randomized Benchmarking with Universal Gates of Fixed Sequence Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard randomized benchmarking protocol requires access to often complex operations that are not always directly accessible. Compiler optimization does not always ensure equal sequence length of the directly accessible universal gates for each random operation. We introduce a version of the RB protocol that creates Haar-randomness using a directly accessible universal gate set of equal sequence length rather than relying upon a t-design or even an approximate one. This makes our protocol highly resource efficient and practical for small qubit numbers. We exemplify our protocol for creating Haar-randomness in the case of single and two qubits. Benchmarking our result with the standard RB protocol, allows us to calculate the overestimation of the average gate fidelity as compared to the standard technique. We augment our findings with a noise analysis which demonstrates that our method could be an effective tool for building accurate models of experimental noise.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based variational autoencoder for classification of quantum and classical states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in optical quantum technologies have been enabled by the generation, manipulation, and characterization of light, with identification based on its photon statistics. However, characterizing light and its sources through single photon measurements often requires efficient detectors and longer measurement times to obtain high-quality photon statistics. Here we introduce a deep learning-based variational autoencoder (VAE) method for classifying single photon added coherent state (SPACS), single photon added thermal state (SPACS), mixed states between coherent/SPACS and thermal/SPATS of light. Our semisupervised learning-based VAE efficiently maps the photon statistics features of light to a lower dimension, enabling quasi-instantaneous classification with low average photon counts. The proposed VAE method is robust and maintains classification accuracy in the presence of losses inherent in an experiment, such as finite collection efficiency, non-unity quantum efficiency, finite number of detectors, etc. Additionally, leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of VAE enables successful classification of data of any quality using a single trained model. We envision that such a deep learning methodology will enable better classification of quantum light and light sources even in the presence of poor detection quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A confined, slow-moving, accelerating electron is shown to emit thermal radiation. Since laboratories face spatial constraints when dealing with rectilinear motion, focusing on a finite total travel distance combines the benefits of simple theoretical analysis with prospects for table-top experimentation. We demonstrate an accelerated moving charge along an asymptotically static worldline with fixed transit distance and slow maximum speed, emitting self-consistent analytic power, spectra, and energy. The classical radiation is Planck distributed with an associated acceleration temperature. This is the first fully parametrized, spectrum-solved, finite-distance worldline.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that exhibits non-Hermiticity in presence of an onsite staggered imaginary potential. This dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain. Though a weak potential can respect the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, a strong potential breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. Furthermore for large commensurate periodicity of the hopping, in-gap states appear that take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strenth of both NH potential and hopping modulation. In particular, this paper is engaged with hopping periodicities of 2, 4 and 8 lattice spacings. The localization of end states and in-gap states at the boundaries are investigated for those hopping periodicities. Though we find that topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry are not very directly connected, distinguishing distribution of $\mathcal{PT}$ broken and unbroken phases are clearly observed within TNP and TTP in our systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have considered Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain special classes of initial states (e.g., states with particle-free regions or perturbations of stationary states), the velocity of information propagation was bounded by a constant in time, $v\leq C$, similarly to quantum spin systems. However, for the more general class of bounded-density initial states, the first-named author together with Vu and Saito derived the velocity bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial lattice dimension. For $D\geq 2$, this bound allows for accelerated information propagation. It has been known since the work of Eisert and Gross that some systems of lattice bosons are capable of accelerated information propagation. It is therefore a central question to understand under what conditions the bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$ can be enhanced. Here, we prove that additional physical constraints, translation-invariance and a $p$-body repulsion of the form $n_x^p$ with $p&gt;D+1$, lead to a LRB with $v\leq C t^{\frac{D}{p-D-1}}$ for any initial state of bounded energy density. We also identify examples of quantum states which show that no further enhancement is possible without using additional dynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity measurement of ULF, VLF and LF fields with Rydberg-atom sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fields with frequencies below megahertz are challenging for Rydberg-atom-based measurements, due to the low-frequency electric field screening effect that is caused by the alkali-metal atoms adsorbed on the inner surface of the container. In this paper, we investigate on electric fields measurements in the ULF, VLF and LF bands in a Cs vapor cell with built-in parallel electrodes. With optimization of the applied DC field, we achieve high-sensitive detection of the electric field at frequencies of 1kHz, 10kHz and 100kHz based on Rydberg-atom sensor, with the minimum electric field strength down to 18.0{\mu}V/cm, 6.9{\mu}V/cm and 3.0{\mu}V/cm, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity is 5.7 {\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}}, 2.2{\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}} and 0.95{\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}} for ULF, VLF and LF fields, which is better than 1-cm dipole antenna. Besides, the linear dynamic range of Rydberg-atom sensor is over 50 dB. This work presents the potential to enable more applications that utilize atomic sensing technology in ULF, VLF and LF fields.</description>

      <title>Universality and two-body losses: lessons from the effective non-Hermitian dynamics of two particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time dynamics of two particles confined in one spatial dimension and subject to two-body losses. The dynamics is exactly described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that can be analytically studied both in the continuum and on a lattice. The asymptotic decay rate and the universal power-law form of the decay of the number of particles are exactly computed in the whole parameter space of the problem. When in the initial state the two particles are far apart, the average number of particles in the setup decays with time $t$ as $t^{-1/2}$; a different power law, $t^{-3/2}$, is found when the two particles overlap in the initial state. These results are valid both in the continuum and on a lattice, but in the latter case a logarithmic correction appears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first concolic testing framework specifically designed for quantum programs. The framework defines quantum conditional statements that quantify quantum states and presents a symbolization method for quantum variables. Utilizing this framework, we generate path constraints for each concrete execution path of a quantum program. These constraints guide the exploration of new paths, with a quantum constraint solver determining the outcomes to generate novel input samples and enhance branch coverage. We implemented this framework in Python and integrated it with Qiskit for practical evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our concolic testing framework significantly improves branch coverage and the quality of quantum input samples, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in quantum software testing.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Gap of a Gaussian Quantum Markovian Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups are the natural non-commutative extension of classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups. They arise in open quantum systems of bosons where canonical non-commuting random variables of positions and momenta come into play. If there exits a faithful invariant density we explicitly compute the optimal exponential convergence rate, namely the spectral gap of the generator, in non-commutative $L^2$ spaces determined by the invariant density showing that the exact value is the lowest eigenvalue of a certain matrix determined by the diffusion and drift matrices. The spectral gap turns out to depend on the non-commutative $L^2$ space considered, whether the one determined by the so-called GNS or KMS multiplication by the square root of the invariant density. In the first case, it is strictly positive if and only if there is the maximum number of linearly independent noises. While, we exhibit explicit examples in which it is strictly positive only with KMS multiplication. We do not assume any symmetry or quantum detailed balance condition with respect to the invariant density.</description>

      <title>The evolution of expanding spacetime realizes approximate quantum cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum information, encoded in a quantum field, evolves during the expansion of spacetime. Due to information loss across the horizon, a local observer experiences this evolution as a nonunitary quantum channel. We obtain this channel in the case of de Sitter spacetime by assuming the initial global state encodes a signal state via fluctuations of the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Notably, de Sitter evolution exhibits intriguing cloning properties, establishing a connection between the curvature of spacetime and the propagation of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying media offer a platform to realize novel and exotic wave effects, including photonic time crystals characterized by momentum band gaps with exponential wave amplification. Here we focus on the quantum electrodynamical properties of time-varying media, in particular vacuum amplification and squeezing. For that purpose, we present a theory of photon pair generation in photonic time crystals that unveils the link between the classical and quantum electrodynamical properties of these systems, that is, a direct relation between reflectivity and pair generation through the squeezing parameter. By working within an Hermitian framework, we are able to characterize quantum pair generation processes in photonic time crystals, showing how momentum bandgaps result in a non-resonant exponential enhancement of dynamical Casimir processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. Our approach exploits the fact that the wave function of each droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates, and hence the relative phases between neighboring droplets allows us to predict the position of the vortices. For a confined system, the estimate accurately reproduces the Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite cycle time information engine based on a two-level system in contact with a thermal reservoir is studied analytically. The model for the engine incorporates an error in measuring the system's state and time delay between the measurement and the feedback process. The efficiency and power of the engine in steady state are derived as a function of level spacing, feedback delay time, engine cycle time, and measurement error. For a fixed value of level spacing and feedback delay, there is an upper bound on measurement error such that the engine can extract positive work. This threshold value of error is found to be independent of the cycle time. For a range of values of level spacing and feedback delay time, efficiency has a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement error, implying that there is an optimal measurement error for the information engine to operate efficiently. At high temperatures and with precise measurement, the engine's ability to extract positive work is extended over a larger range of feedback delay time.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis for Spatial Phase Reconstruction in Atom Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are sensitive to a wide range of forces by encoding their signals in interference patterns of matter waves. To estimate the magnitude of these forces, the underlying phase shifts they imprint on the atoms must be extracted. Up until now, extraction algorithms typically rely on a fixed model of the patterns' spatial structure, which if inaccurate can lead to systematic errors caused by, for example, wavefront aberrations of the used lasers. In this paper we employ an algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis, which is capable of characterizing the spatial phase structure and per image phase offsets of an atom interferometer from a set of images. The algorithm does so without any prior knowledge about the specific spatial pattern as long as this pattern is the same for all images in the set. On simulated images with atom projection noise we show the algorithm's reconstruction performance follows distinct scaling laws, i.e., it is inversely-proportional to the square-root of the number atoms or the number of images respectively, which allows a projection of its performance for experiments. We also successfully extract the spatial phase patterns of two experimental data sets from an atom gravimeter. This algorithm is a first step towards a better understanding and complex spatial phase patterns, e.g., caused by inhomogeneous laser fields in atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Discovery of T center-like quantum defects in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies would benefit from the development of high performance quantum defects acting as single-photon emitters or spin-photon interface. Finding such a quantum defect in silicon is especially appealing in view of its favorable spin bath and high processability. While some color centers in silicon have been emerging in quantum applications, there is still a need to search and develop new high performance quantum emitters. Searching a high-throughput computational database of more than 22,000 charged complex defects in silicon, we identify a series of defects formed by a group III element combined with carbon ((A-C)$\rm _{Si}$ with A=B,Al,Ga,In,Tl) and substituting on a silicon site. These defects are analogous structurally, electronically and chemically to the well-known T center in silicon ((C-C-H)$\rm_{Si}$) and their optical properties are mainly driven by an unpaired electron in a carbon $p$ orbital. They all emit in the telecom and some of these color centers show improved properties compared to the T center in terms of computed radiative lifetime or emission efficiency. We also show that the synthesis of hydrogenated T center-like defects followed by a dehydrogenation annealing step could be an efficient way of synthesis. All the T center-like defects show a higher symmetry than the T center making them easier to align with magnetic fields. Our work motivates further studies on the synthesis and control of this new family of quantum defects, and also demonstrates the use of high-throughput computational screening to detect new complex quantum defects.</description>

      <title>Multimode amplitude squeezing through cascaded nonlinear optical processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is enticing for several applications, from squeezed frequency combs for spectroscopy to signal multiplexing in optical computing. To generate squeezing in multiple frequency modes, optical parametric oscillators have been vital in realizing multimode squeezed vacuum states through second-order nonlinear processes. However, most work has focused on generating multimode squeezed vacua and squeezing in mode superpositions (supermodes). Bright squeezing in multiple discrete frequency modes, if realized, could unlock novel applications in quantum-enhanced spectroscopy and optical quantum computing. Here, we show how $Q$ factor engineering of a multimode nonlinear cavity with cascaded three wave mixing processes creates strong, spectrally tunable single mode output amplitude noise squeezing over 10 dB below the shot noise limit. In addition, we demonstrate squeezing for multiple discrete frequency modes above threshold. This bright squeezing arises from enhancement of the (noiseless) nonlinear rate relative to decay rates in the system due to the cascaded generation of photons in a single idler "bath" mode. A natural consequence of the strong nonlinear coupling in our system is the creation of an effective cavity in the synthetic frequency dimension that sustains Bloch oscillations in the modal energy distribution. Bloch mode engineering could provide an opportunity to better control nonlinear energy flow in the synthetic frequency dimension, with exciting applications in quantum random walks and topological photonics. Lastly, we show evidence of long-range correlations in amplitude noise between discrete frequency modes, pointing towards the potential of long-range entanglement in a synthetic frequency dimension.</description>

      <title>Raman-phonon-polariton condensation in a transversely pumped cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid states of light and matter that are typically realised when optically active phonons couple strongly to photons. We suggest a new approach to realising phonon polaritons, by employing a transverse-pumping Raman scheme, as used in experiments on cold atoms in optical cavities. This approach allows hybridisation between an optical cavity mode and any Raman-active phonon mode. Moreover, this approach enables one to tune the effective phonon-photon coupling by changing the strength of the transverse pumping light. We show that such a system may realise a phonon-polariton condensate. To do this, we find the stationary states and use Floquet theory to determine their stability. We thus identify distinct superradiant and lasing states in which the polariton modes are macroscopically populated. We map out the phase diagram of these states as a function of pump frequencies and strengths. Using parameters for transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that realisation of these phases may be practicably obtainable. The ability to manipulate phonon mode frequencies and attain steady-state populations of selected phonon modes provides a new tool for engineering correlated states of electrons.</description>

      <title>One-Wayness in Quantum Cryptography</title>

Abstract: The existence of one-way functions is one of the most fundamental assumptions in classical cryptography. In the quantum world, on the other hand, there are evidences that some cryptographic primitives can exist even if one-way functions do not exist. We therefore have the following important open problem in quantum cryptography: What is the most fundamental element in quantum cryptography? In this direction, Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian recently defined a notion called EFI pairs, which are pairs of efficiently generatable states that are statistically distinguishable but computationally indistinguishable, and showed its equivalence with some cryptographic primitives including commitments, oblivious transfer, and general multi-party computations. However, their work focuses on decision-type primitives and does not cover search-type primitives like quantum money and digital signatures. In this paper, we study properties of one-way state generators (OWSGs), which are a quantum analogue of one-way functions. We first revisit the definition of OWSGs and generalize it by allowing mixed output states. Then we show the following results. (1) We define a weaker version of OWSGs, weak OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to OWSGs. (2) Quantum digital signatures are equivalent to OWSGs. (3) Private-key quantum money schemes (with pure money states) imply OWSGs. (4) Quantum pseudo one-time pad schemes imply both OWSGs and EFI pairs. (5) We introduce an incomparable variant of OWSGs, which we call secretly-verifiable and statistically-invertible OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to EFI pairs.</description>

      <title>Efficient excitation-transfer across fully connected networks via local-energy optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the excitation transfer across a fully connected quantum network whose sites energies can be artificially designed. Starting from a simplified model of a broadly-studied physical system, we systematically optimize its local energies to achieve high excitation transfer for various environmental conditions, using an adaptive Gradient Descent technique and Automatic Differentiation. We show that almost perfect transfer can be achieved with and without local dephasing, provided that the dephasing rates are not too large. We investigate our solutions in terms of resilience against variations in either the network connection strengths, or size, as well as coherence losses. We highlight the different features of a dephasing-free and dephasing-driven transfer. Our work gives further insight into the interplay between coherence and dephasing effects in excitation-transfer phenomena across fully connected quantum networks. In turn, this will help designing optimal transfer in artificial open networks through the simple manipulation of local energies.</description>

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - also colloquially referred to as magic - is the a resource for advantage in quantum computing and lies in the access to non-Clifford operations. Developing a comprehensive understanding of how non-stabilizerness can be quantified and how it relates other quantum resources is crucial for studying and characterizing the origin of quantum complexity. In this work, we establish a direct connection between non-stabilizerness and entanglement spectrum flatness for a pure quantum state. We show that this connection can be exploited to efficiently probe non-stabilizerness even in presence of noise. Our results reveal a direct connection between non-stabilizerness and entanglement response, and define a clear experimental protocol to probe non-stabilizerness in cold atom and solid-state platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting code can diagnose potential errors and correct them based on measured outcomes by leveraging syndrome measurement. However, mid-circuit measurement has been technically challenging for early fault-tolerant quantum computers and the readout-induced noise acts as a main contributor to the logical infidelity. We present a different method for syndrome extraction, namely Generalized Syndrome Measurement, that requires only a single-shot measurement on a single ancilla, while the canonical syndrome measurement requires multiple measurements to extract the eigenvalue for each stabilizer generator. As such, we can detect the error in the logical state with minimized readout-induced noise. By adopting our method as a pre-check routine for quantum error correcting cycles, we can significantly reduce the readout overhead, the idling time, and the logical error rate during syndrome measurement. We numerically analyze the performance of our protocol using Iceberg code and Steane code under realistic noise parameters based on superconducting hardware and demonstrate the advantage of our protocol in the near-term scenario. As mid-circuit measurements are still error-prone for near-term quantum hardware, our method may boost the applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Solid-state emitters such as epitaxial quantum dots have emerged as a leading platform for efficient, on-demand sources of indistinguishable photons, a key resource for many optical quantum technologies. To maximise performance, these sources normally operate at liquid helium temperatures ($\sim 4~\mathrm{K}$), introducing significant size, weight and power requirements that can be impractical for proposed applications. Here we experimentally resolve the two distinct temperature-dependent phonon interactions that degrade indistinguishability, allowing us to demonstrate that coupling to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at elevated temperatures up to $30~\mathrm{K}$ that are compatible with compact cryocoolers. We derive a polaron model that fully captures the temperature-dependent influence of phonons observed in our experiments, providing predictive power to further increase the indistinguishability and operating temperature of future devices through optimised cavity parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring Shallow-Depth Boson Sampling: Towards Scalable Quantum Supremacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson sampling is a sampling task proven to be hard to simulate efficiently using classical computers under plausible assumptions, which makes it an appealing candidate for quantum supremacy. However, due to a large noise rate for near-term quantum devices, it is still unclear whether those noisy devices maintain the quantum advantage for much larger quantum systems. Since the noise rate typically grows with the circuit depth, an alternative is to find evidence of simulation hardness at the shallow-depth quantum circuit. To find the evidence, one way is to identify the minimum depth required for the average-case hardness of approximating output probabilities, which is considered a necessary condition for the state-of-the-art technique to prove the simulation hardness of boson sampling. In this work, we analyze the output probability distribution of shallow-depth boson sampling for Fock-states and Gaussian states, and examine the limitation of the average-case hardness argument at this shallow-depth regime for geometrically local architectures. We propose a shallow-depth linear optical circuit architecture that can overcome the problems associated with geometrically local architectures. Our numerical results suggest that this architecture demonstrates possibilities of average-case hardness properties in a shallow-depth regime, through its resemblance to the global Haar-random boson sampling circuit. This result implies that the corresponding architecture has the potential to be utilized for scalable quantum supremacy with its shallow-depth boson sampling.</description>

Abstract: If time is emergent, quantum system is entangled with quantum time as it evolves. If the system contains entanglement within itself, which we can call internal entanglement to distinguish it from the "external" time-system entanglement, the speed of evolution is enhanced. In this paper, we show the correlation between the novel time-system entanglement and the conventional internal entanglement of a system that contains two entangled qubits. We consider two cases: (1) two initially entangled qubits that evolve under local dynamics; (2) two interacting qubits such that entanglement between them is generated over time. In the first case, we obtain the main result that increasing internal entanglement speeds up the evolution and makes the system more entangled with time. For both cases, we show the dependence of time-system entanglement entropy on the distance of evolution which is characterized by fidelity. The interacting system can evolve faster than the non-interacting system if the interaction is sufficiently strong, and thus it can be entangled with time more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Theoretical proposal for the experimental realization of realignment operation</title>

Abstract: Realignment operation has a significant role in detecting bound as well as free entanglement. Just like partial transposition, it is also based on permutations of the matrix elements. However, the physical implementation of realignment operation is not known yet. In this letter, we address the problem of experimental realization of realignment operation and to achieve this aim, we propose a theoretical proposal for the same. We first show that after applying the realignment operation on a bipartite state, the resulting matrix can be expressed in terms of the partial transposition operation along with column interchange operations. We observed that these column interchange operations forms a permutation matrix which can be implemented via SWAP operator acting on the density matrix. This mathematical framework is used to exactly determine the first moment of the realignment matrix experimentally. This has been done by showing that the first moment of the realignment matrix can be expressed as the expectation value of a SWAP operator which indicates the possibility of its measurement. Further, we have provided an estimation of the higher order realigned moments in terms of the first realigned moment and thus pave a way to estimate the higher order moments experimentally. Next, we develop moments based entanglement detection criteria that detect positive partial transpose entangled states (PPTES) as well as negative partial transpose entangled states (NPTES). Moreover, we define a new matrix realignment operation for three-qubit states and have devised an entanglement criteria that is able to detect three-qubit fully entangled states. We have developed various methods and techniques in the detection of bipartite and tripartite entangled states that may be realized in the current technology.</description>

      <title>Virtual mitigation of coherent non-adiabatic transitions by echo verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transitions out of the ground space limit the performance of quantum adiabatic algorithms, while hardware imperfections impose stringent limitations on the circuit depth. We propose an adiabatic echo verification protocol which mitigates both coherent and incoherent errors, arising from non-adiabatic transitions and hardware noise, respectively. Quasi-adiabatically evolving forward and backwards allows for an echo-verified measurement of any observable. In addition to mitigating hardware noise, our method uses positive-time dynamics only. Crucially, the estimator bias of the observable is reduced when compared to standard adiabatic preparation, achieving up to a quadratic improvement.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Telecloning on Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>

Abstract: Quantum information can not be perfectly cloned, but approximate copies of quantum information can be generated. Quantum telecloning combines approximate quantum cloning, more typically referred as quantum cloning, and quantum teleportation. Quantum telecloning allows approximate copies of quantum information to be constructed by separate parties, using the classical results of a Bell measurement made on a prepared quantum telecloning state. Quantum telecloning can be implemented as a circuit on quantum computers using a classical co-processor to compute classical feed forward instructions using if statements based on the results of a mid-circuit Bell measurement in real time. We present universal, symmetric, optimal $1 \rightarrow M$ telecloning circuits, and experimentally demonstrate these quantum telecloning circuits for $M=2$ up to $M=10$, natively executed with real time classical control systems on IBM Quantum superconducting processors, known as dynamic circuits. We perform the cloning procedure on many different message states across the Bloch sphere, on $7$ IBM Quantum processors, optionally using the error suppression technique X-X sequence digital dynamical decoupling. Two circuit optimizations are utilized, one which removes ancilla qubits for $M=2, 3$, and one which reduces the total number of gates in the circuit but still uses ancilla qubits. Parallel single qubit tomography with MLE density matrix reconstruction is used in order to compute the mixed state density matrices of the clone qubits, and clone quality is measured using quantum fidelity. These results present one of the largest and most comprehensive NISQ computer experimental analyses on (single qubit) quantum telecloning to date. The clone fidelity sharply decreases to $0.5$ for $M &gt; 5$, but for $M=2$ we are able to achieve a mean clone fidelity of up to $0.79$ using dynamical decoupling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical computation for automatic guided vehicles scheduling</title>

Abstract: Motivated by global efforts to develop quantum computing for practical, industrial-scale challenges, we showcase the effectiveness of state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical solvers in addressing the business-centric optimization problem of scheduling Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). These solvers leverage a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device, specifically a D-Wave quantum annealer. In our study, the hybrid solvers exhibit non-zero quantum processing times, indicating a significant contribution of the quantum component to solution efficiency. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers, thus indicating `quantum readiness' for scheduling tasks. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our new approach concerns mapping a realistic AGV problem onto a problem reminiscient of railway scheduling and demonstrating that the AGV problem more suits quantum computing than the railway counterpart and is more dense in terms of an average number of constraints per variable. We demonstrate that a scenario involving 15 AGVs, which holds practical significance due to common bottlenecks like shared main lanes leading to frequent deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid quantum-classical solver within seconds. Consequently, our research paves the way for the near-future business adoption of hybrid quantum-classical solutions for AGV scheduling, anticipating that forthcoming improvements in manufacturing efficiency will increase both the number of AGVs deployed and the premium on factory space.</description>

      <title>Entangling two giant atoms via a topological waveguide</title>

Abstract: The entanglement generation of two two-level giant atoms coupled to a photonic waveguide, which is formed by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) type coupled-cavity array is studied. Here, each atom is coupled to the waveguide through two coupling points. The two-atom separate-coupling case is studied, and 16 coupling configurations are considered for the coupling-point distributions between the two atoms and the waveguide. Quantum master equations are derived to govern the evolution of the two atoms and characterize atomic entanglement by calculating the concurrence of the two-atom states. It is found that the two giant-atom entanglement depends on the coupling configurations and the coupling-point distance of the giant atoms. In particular, the entanglement dynamics of the two giant atoms in 14 coupling configurations depend on the dimerization parameter of the SSH waveguide. According to the self-energies of the two giant atoms, it is found that ten of these 16 coupling configurations can be divided into five pairs. It is also showed that the delayed sudden birth of entanglement between the two giant atoms is largely enhanced in these five pairs of coupling configurations. This work will promote the study of quantum effects and coherent manipulation in giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Pulse-Time Effects in Long-Baseline Quantum Clock Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>

Abstract: We study the robustness of the evolution of a quantum system against small uncontrolled variations in parameters in the Hamiltonian. We show that the fidelity susceptibility, which quantifies the perturbative error to leading order, can be expressed in superoperator form and use this to derive control pulses which are robust to any class of systematic unknown errors. The proposed optimal control protocol is equivalent to searching for a sequence of unitaries that mimics the first-order moments of the Haar distribution, i.e. it constitutes a 1-design. We highlight the power of our results for error resistant single- and two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for strategies to harness the temperature of quantum systems is one of the main goals in quantum thermodynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a system made of a pair of quantum harmonic oscillators, represented by single-mode cavity fields, interacting with a thermally excited beam of phaseonium atoms, which act as ancillas. The two cavities are arranged in a cascade configuration, so that the second cavity interacts with phaseonium atoms only after their interaction with the first one. We provide exact closed dynamics of the first cavity for arbitrarily long interaction times. We highlight the role played by the characteristic coherence phase of phaseonium atoms in determining the steady states of the cavity fields as well as that of the ancillas. Also, we show how the second cavity follows a non-Markovian evolution due to interactions with the "used" ancillary atoms, that enables information exchange with the first cavity. Adjusting the parameters of the phaseonium atoms, we can determine the final stable temperature reached by the cavities. In this way, the cavities can be heated up as well as cooled down. These results provide useful insights towards the use of different types of ancillas for thermodynamic cycles in cavity QED scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of measurement-induced information in many-body ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike unitary dynamics, measurements of a subsystem can induce long-range entanglement via quantum teleportation. The amount of measurement-induced entanglement or mutual information depends jointly on the measurement basis and the entanglement structure of the state (before measurement), and has operational significance for whether the state is a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, as well as for the computational complexity of simulating the state using quantum or classical computers. In this work, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) and information (MII) for the ground-states of quantum many-body systems in one- and two- spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in $1d$ the leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in $2d$, the existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that trivial $2d$ states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie in sub-leading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading contributions to strange-correlators, used to numerically identify topological phases, are in fact non-universal in two or more dimensions, and explain how our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components. We discuss the implications of these results for classical- and quantum- computational simulation of quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry with increasingly larger masses could pave the way to understanding the nature of wavefunction collapse, the quantum to classical transition or even how an object in a spatial superposition interacts with its gravitational field. In order to improve upon the current mass record, it is necessary to move into the nano-particle regime. In this paper we provide a design for a nano-particle Talbot-Lau matter-wave interferometer that circumvents the practical challenges of previously proposed designs. We present simulations of the expected fringe patterns that such an interferometer would produce, considering all major sources of decoherence. We discuss the practical challenges involved in building such an experiment as well as some preliminary experimental results to illustrate the proposed measurement scheme. We show that such a design is suitable for seeing interference fringes with $10^6$amu SiO$_2$ particles, and that this design can be extended to even $10^8$amu particles by using flight times below the typical Talbot time of the system.</description>

      <title>Energy Landscapes for the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have demonstrated considerable potential in solving NP-hard combinatorial problems in the contemporary near intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) is one such algorithm, used in solving the maximum cut (Max-Cut) problem for a given graph by successive implementation of $L$ quantum circuit layers within a corresponding Trotterised ansatz. The challenge of exploring the cost function of VQAs arising from an exponential proliferation of local minima with increasing circuit depth has been well-documented. However, fewer studies have investigated the impact of circuit depth on QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. Here, we employ basin-hopping global optimisation methods to navigate the energy landscapes for QAOA ans\"atze for various graphs, and analyse QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. The structure of the solution space is also investigated using discrete path sampling to build databases of local minima and the transition states that connect them, providing insightful visualisations using disconnectivity graphs. We find that the corresponding landscapes generally have a single funnel organisation, which makes it relatively straightforward to locate low-lying minima with good Max-Cut solution probabilities. In some cases below the adiabatic limit the second lowest local minimum may even yield a higher solution probability than the global minimum. This important observation has motivated us to develop broader metrics in evaluating QAOA performance, based on collections of minima obtained from basin-hopping global optimisation. Hence we establish expectation thresholds in elucidating useful solution probabilities from local minima, an approach that may provide significant gains in elucidating reasonable solution probabilities from local minima.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an object called a \emph{subspace graph} that formalizes the technique of multidimensional quantum walks. Composing subspace graphs allows one to seamlessly combine quantum and classical reasoning, keeping a classical structure in mind, while abstracting quantum parts into subgraphs with simple boundaries as needed. As an example, we show how to combine a \emph{switching network} with arbitrary quantum subroutines, to compute a composed function. As another application, we give a time-efficient implementation of quantum Divide \&amp; Conquer when the sub-problems are combined via a Boolean formula. We use this to quadratically speed up Savitch's algorithm for directed $st$-connectivity.</description>

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers face a critical limitation in qubit numbers, hindering their progression towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A significant challenge impeding scaling is crosstalk, characterized by unwanted interactions among neighboring components on quantum chips, including qubits, resonators, and substrate. We motivate a general approach to systematically resolving multifaceted crosstalks in a limited substrate area. We propose Qplacer, a frequency-aware electrostatic-based placement framework tailored for superconducting quantum computers, to alleviate crosstalk by isolating these components in spatial and frequency domains alongside compact substrate design. Qplacer commences with a frequency assigner that ensures frequency domain isolation for qubits and resonators. It then incorporates a padding strategy and resonator partitioning for layout flexibility. Central to our approach is the conceptualization of quantum components as charged particles, enabling strategic spatial isolation through a 'frequency repulsive force' concept. Our results demonstrate that Qplacer carefully crafts the physical component layout in mitigating various crosstalk impacts while maintaining a compact substrate size. On various device topologies and NISQ benchmarks, Qplacer improves fidelity by an average of 36.7x and reduces spatial violations (susceptible to crosstalk) by an average of 12.76x, compared to classical placement engines. Regarding area optimization, compared to manual designs, Qplacer can reduce the required layout area by 2.14x on average</description>

Abstract: A protocol for regulating the distribution of quantum information between multiple parties is put forward. In order to prohibit the unrestricted distribution of quantum-resource states in a public quantum network, agents can apply a resource-destroying map to each sender's channel. Since resource-destroying maps only exist for affine quantum resource theories, censorship of a nonaffine resource theory is established on an operationally motivated subspace of free states. This is achieved by using what we name a resource-censoring map. The protocol is applied to censoring coherence, reference frames, and entanglement. Because of the local nature of the censorship protocol, it is, in principle, possible for collaborating parties to bypass censorship. Thus, we additionally derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the censorship protocol is unbreakable.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter cascaded quantum interferometer</title>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a multiparameter cascaded quantum interferometer in which a two-input and two-output setup is obtained by concatenating 50:50 beam splitters with n independent and adjustable time delays. A general method for deriving the coincidence probability of such an interferometer is given based on the linear transformation of the matrix of beam splitters. As examples, we analyze the interference characteristics of one-, two- and three-parameter cascaded quantum interferometers with different frequency correlations and input states. Some typical interferograms of such interferometers are provided to reveal more rich and complicated two-photon interference phenomena. In principle, arbitrary two-input and two-output experimental setups can be designed with the proposal. This work offers a toolbox for designing versatile quantum interferometers and provides a convenient method for deriving the coincidence probabilities involved. Potential applications can be found in the complete spectral characterization of two-photon states, multiparameter estimation, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Victor Hugo's timeless observation, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come", resonates today as Quantum Computing, once only a dream of a physicist, stands at the threshold of reality with the potential to revolutionise the world. To comprehend the surge of attention it commands today, one must delve into the motivations that birthed and nurtured Quantum Computing. While the past of Quantum Computing provides insights into the present, the future could unfold through the lens of Quantum Software Engineering. Quantum Software Engineering, guided by its principles and methodologies investigates the most effective ways to interact with Quantum Computers to unlock their true potential and usher in a new era of possibilities. To gain insight into the present landscape and anticipate the trajectory of Quantum Computing and Quantum Software Engineering, this paper embarks on a journey through their evolution and outlines potential directions for future research. By doing so, we aim to equip readers (ideally software engineers and computer scientists not necessarily with quantum expertise) with the insights necessary to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of Quantum Computing and anticipate the trajectories that lie ahead.</description>

Abstract: A quantum advantage can be achieved in the unitary charging of quantum batteries if their cells are interacting. Here, we try to clarify with some analytical calculations whether and how this quantum advantage is achieved for sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) interactions. By performing a simple modelization, we find that for $q$-point rescaled sparse SYK interactions the quantum advantage goes as $\Gamma\sim N^{\frac{\alpha}{q}-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $\alpha$ is related to the connectivity and $N$ is the number of cells.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Array Filtering of Resonance Fluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel frequency-filtering method for measuring and calculating frequency-filtered photon-correlations. This novel method is a cavity-based system we call the multi-mode array filter, which consists of an array of tunable single-mode cavities that are equally spaced in frequency. By introducing a mode-dependent phase modulation, we produce a near rectangular frequency response, allowing us to increase the filter bandwidth -- and thus the temporal response -- without sacrificing frequency isolation. We model the frequency filtering using a cascaded quantum open systems approach which completely neglects any back-action of the filter onto the source system. This allows us to derive a closed set of operator moment equations for source and filter system operators, thus providing an extremely efficient method to calculate frequency-filtered first- and second-order correlation functions. We demonstrate this novel filtering method by applying it to a resonantly driven two-level atom. We present examples of frequency-filtered power spectra to demonstrate the improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter over the single-mode filter. We then present results for the single-mode and multi-mode-array filtered second-order auto- and cross-correlation functions. These are compared against expressions derived in the secular approximation. The improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter allows us to investigate new regimes of frequency-filtered photon correlations, such as two-photon leapfrog processes, and the effect of vanishing bandwidth on filtered auto-correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1 K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is recognized that Anderson localization takes place for all states at a dimension $d$ less or equal $2$, while delocalization is expected for hopping $V(r)$ decreasing with the distance slower or as $r^{-d}$, the localization problem in the crossover regime for the dimension $d=2$ and hopping $V(r) \propto r^{-2}$ is not resolved yet. Following earlier suggestions we show that for the hopping determined by two-dimensional anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry there exist two distinguishable phases at weak and strong disorder. The first phase is characterized by ergodic dynamics and superdiffusive transport, while the second phase is characterized by diffusive transport and delocalized eigenstates with fractal dimension less than $2$. The transition between phases is resolved analytically using the extension of scaling theory of localization and verified numerically using an exact numerical diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multi-layer moire structures in strong external magnetic fields as a novel platform for realizing highly-tunable, frustrated Hubbard physics with topological order. Identifying the layer degree of freedom as a pseudo spin, allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry while controlling ring-exchange processes and concurrently quenching the kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of interacting Hubbard-Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably, in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we find chiral pseudo spin liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic field. We find that this topologically ordered state remains exceptionally stable towards relevant perturbations. We discuss how layer pseudo-spin can be probed in near-term experiments. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moire systems, our approach provides a promising route towards the experimental realization and control of topologically ordered phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We aim to address the following question: if we start with a quantum state with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry, what is the fate of the system under weak local quantum measurements? We demonstrate that under certain conditions, a phase transition can be driven by weak measurements, which suppresses the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry and weakens the 1-form symmetry charge fluctuation. We analyze the nature of the transitions employing the tool of duality, and we demonstrate that some of the transitions driven by weak measurement enjoy a line of fixed points with self-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular ions that are generated by chemical reactions with trapped atomic ions can serve as an accessible testbed for developing molecular quantum technologies. On the other hand, they are also a hindrance to scaling up quantum computers based on atomic ions as unavoidable reactions with background gas destroy the information carriers. Here, we investigate the single- and two-photon dissociation processes of single $\text{CaOH}^+$ molecular ions co-trapped in $\text{Ca}^+$ ion crystals using a femtosecond laser system. We report the photodissociation cross section spectra of $\text{CaOH}^+$ for single-photon processes at $\lambda=$245 - 275$\,$nm and for two-photon processes at $\lambda=$500 - 540$\,$nm. Measurements are interpreted with quantum-chemical calculations, which predict the photodissociation threshold for $\text{CaOH}^+\to \text{Ca}^++\text{OH}$ at 265$\,$nm. This result can serve as a basis for dissociation-based spectroscopy for studying the internal structure of $\text{CaOH}^+$. The result also gives a prescription for recycling $\text{Ca}^+$ ions in large-scale trapped $\text{Ca}^+$ quantum experiments from undesired $\text{CaOH}^+$ ions formed in the presence of background water vapor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number dependent level splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum computing and quantum information science protocols.</description>

Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field given by $E(t) = E_0 sech^2(t/\tau)$, with height of $E_0$ and width of $\tau$. Sah recently discussed the problem of pair production after a finite evolution time [9]. This raises questions about the instantaneous appearance of particles in pair production and their behavior at intermediate times when using a formalism that involves solving an evolution equation for a dynamical quantity. Is it possible to make general statements about this behavior? To address these questions, we analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-)$ pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation, and we compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' Longitudinal Momentum Spectrum (LMS) of the created particles at finite times. We observe oscillatory structure in the LMS. This oscillation behavior at finite time clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with particle production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. This reveals that these oscillations are not due to transient excitations and basis-dependent signatures. Again, we emphasize that the oscillations seen in the LMS from both approaches are not artifacts but possess significant physical relevance.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescent atomic defects, especially in dielectric materials, such as diamond are quite promising for several emerging quantum applications. However, efficient light extraction, directional emission, and narrow spectral emission are key challenges. We have designed dielectric metasurface exploiting Mie-resonance and the Kerker condition to address these issues. Our designed diamond metasurface, tailored for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond, predicts up to 500x improvement in the collection of 637 nm (zero phonon line) photons over that from the bare diamond. Our design achieves highly directional emission, predominantly emitting in a 20 degree lobe in the forward direction. This makes light collection more efficient, including for fiber-based collection. The predicted results are stable against the position of the emitter placed in the metaelement, thus alleviating the challenging fabrication requirement of precise positioning of the defect center. Equally importantly, our design approach can be applied to enhance single photon emission also from other defects such as SiV, other materials such as hBN, and other sources such as quantum dots.</description>
