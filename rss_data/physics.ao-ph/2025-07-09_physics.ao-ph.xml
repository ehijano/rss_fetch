      <title>Site-Specific Parameterization of Ocean Spectra for Power Estimates of Wave Energy Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the mean annual power of a wave energy converter (WEC) through the method of bins relies on a parametric representation of all possible sea states. In practice, two-parameter spectra based on significant wave height and energy period are ubiquitous. Two-parameter spectra have been shown insufficient in capturing the range of spectral shapes that can occur in an actual ocean environment. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, these two-parameters have been shown to be insufficient for predicting power performance of WECs. Four parameter spectra, which expand the parameter space to include two additional shape parameters have been shown sufficient in capturing sea state variance, but their effect on mean power estimates has not been presented. This work directly looks at the effects of incorporating 4-parameter spectra into annual power estimates compared to using the traditional 2-parameter spectra. We use two different 4-parameter spectra: one from the literature and a novel machine learning-based autoencoder, presented here. Both are shown to improve the information retained when parameterizing spectra. The site-specific autoencoder performs consistently the best across two case studies of mean annual power prediction, achieving an error around 1% in each instance. The 2-parameter spectra resulted in less consistent predictive performance, with errors of -8% and 1% in the two case studies. For the case study where all three models performed well, it is shown that the low error in the 2-parameter model is attributable to a symmetrical distribution of large errors whereas both 4-parameter spectra result in relatively low errors throughout the parametric space. These results highlight the need for more sophisticated resource characterization methods for estimating the power performance of WECs and suggest site-specific machine learning-based spectra are an adequate option.</description>

      <title>HRRRCast: a data-driven emulator for regional weather forecasting at convection allowing scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States (CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR) and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain, b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis. While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient, data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble capability.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</description>
