      <title>Uniqueness of the asymptotic limits for Ricci-flat manifolds with linear volume growth II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the uniqueness of asymptotic limits for noncollapsed Ricci flat manifolds with linear volume growth to the existence of a harmonic function asymptotic to a Busemann function.
  Parallel to the work of Colding--Minicozzi in the Euclidean volume growth setting, we prove uniqueness of the asymptotic limit and establish a quantitative polynomial convergence rate via a monotone quantity associated with this harmonic function, assuming such harmonic function exists and one asymptotic limit is smooth.
  Conversely, for an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, we show that uniqueness of the asymptotic limit implies the existence of the desired harmonic function, without assuming smoothness of the cross section.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics (governing sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetry and an established strengthening of log-Sobolev inequality -- namely, nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime (concerning constant-volume sets), expressed as the Gaussian isoperimetric profile times the square root of spectral gap. Furthermore, we apply our results to establish quantitative relations among optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities, additionally covering isoperimetry for subexponentially and superexponentially small sets. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Busemann-Petty Problem for Arbitrary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Busemann-Petty problem asks whether smaller central hyperplane sections of origin-symmetric convex bodies necessarily imply smaller total volume. Zvavitch studied this question for arbitrary measures with continuous even densities, providing sufficient conditions for affirmative cases in terms of the distributional behavior of the ratio between the densities involved. We refine this result by extending it to a broader class of distributions and allowing a distinct pair of densities for each body, one for hyperplane sections and another for the full volume. We also present some examples illustrating cases not covered by previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the rectangular peg problem for a large class of continuous Jordan curves that contains all rectifiable curves and Stromquist's locally monotone curves. Our proof is based on microlocal sheaf theory and inspired by recent work of Greene and Lobb.</description>

      <title>Some comments on the mth-order Projection Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Petty's projection inequality is a sharp upper bound for the volume of the polar projection body of a convex body. Lutwak introduced the concept of mixed projection bodies and extended Petty's projection inequality. Alonso-Guti\'{e}rrez later did a stability result for Petty's projection inequality.
  In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order setting and extended the difference body to that setting. In a previous work, we, working with Haddad, Putterman, Roysdon, and Ye, established an extension of the projection body operator to this setting. In this note, we continue this study for the mixed projection body operator as well as the question of stability.</description>

      <title>Finsler Metric Clustering in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a foundational framework for geometric learning in weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{q}}$ by introducing a hierarchical clustering algorithm governed by Finsler geometry. We define a scaling-invariant Finsler metric $d_F([z], [w])$-and its rational analogue $d_{F,\mathbb{Q}}([z], [w])$-derived from an optimization-based Finsler norm that effectively quotients out the weighted scaling action. Unlike previous approaches that characterized these spaces via non-metric dissimilarity measures, we rigorously prove that our construction satisfies the triangle inequality, providing a true metric framework that ensures the stability of hierarchical clustering via the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.
  We demonstrate that this metric approach preserves the intrinsic scaling symmetries and weighted topology of $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{q}}$ without the topological distortions inherent in Euclidean approximations. The algorithm's efficacy is explored in the context of arithmetic geometry (clustering moduli spaces of genus two curves), arithmetic dynamics, and quantum state-space analysis, where the weights $\mathbb{q}$ represent anisotropic physical constraints and noise profiles. This work establishes a robust theoretical foundation for the development of graded neural networks and other machine learning techniques for graded algebraic varieties.</description>
