      <title>Zitterbewegung CP violation in a Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral kaons oscillations in a Schwarzschild spacetime are analyzed. The interplay between two oscillations: (i) mixing associated with second order weak coupling and (ii) strange quark's zitterbewegung, introduces a coupling responsible for the observed CP violation. This curvature induced violation is a CPT violation with T conservation rather than a T violation with CPT conservation. The non-dissipative Hermitian evolution of the kaons system leads to the identification of this CPT violation. Then, the finite lifetime of the short-lived kaons induces a dissipative rotation of the imaginary violation parameter such that it becomes real and appears as a T violation. The consequences of this elucidation of the origin of neutral kaons CP violation are then discussed and some open perspectives are identified.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity and the 4-Point Vertices in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a complete set of 4-point vertices in the Constructive Standard Model (CSM). This set is smaller than in Feynman diagrams as the CSM does not need or allow any additional 4-point vertices (or contact terms) beyond what is present in Feynman diagrams and, furthermore, it does not need or allow a 4-point vertex for A,Z,W+,W- or A,A,W+,W-, in addition to the already known absence of the 4-gluon vertex. We show that with this set of 4-point vertices, perturbative unitarity is satisfied in the CSM. Additionally, we show that many constructive diagrams are not Feynman diagrams rewritten in spinor form. In fact, we show that there is a significant rearrangement of contributions from the diagrams in constructive calculations relative to Feynman diagrams, for some processes. In addition to the already known or expected rearrangement in diagrams involving external photons, we also find that diagrams involving a 4-vector-boson vertex are also significantly different than their Feynman counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of 4-Point Amplitudes in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete set of 4-point amplitudes in the constructive Standard Model at tree level. Any 4-point amplitude can be obtained from the results presented here by a suitable choice of masses, a permutation of the particles (by crossing symmetry), and a reversal of the momenta of the outgoing particles. We have validated all of these amplitudes by comparing with Feynman diagrams for a variety of masses, scattering energy and angles, and helicities of the photons and gluons, when they are in the initial states. The standard constructive techniques work for these amplitudes without the need for any contact terms and indeed, contact terms are not allowed. Only five 4-point vertices are used (allowed), involving the Higgs boson and the W and Z bosons. When external photons or gluons are present, the amplitude simplifies to a single spinor-product structure, present in the numerator. In a few cases, however, the propagator structure is more complex, with different terms depending on the charge or color structure.</description>

      <title>SPINAS: Spinor Amplitude Subroutines for Constructive Diagram Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPINAS is a C++ package created for the implementation and numerical computation of phase-space points of constructive amplitudes in particle physics. This package contains a suite of classes and methods for handling particles, propagators, spinor products, and processes. SPINAS is structured to offer straightforward usability while ensuring maximum efficiency. This is achieved through a design that emphasizes the storage and reuse of intermediate results within amplitude calculations for each phase-space point. We include a user guide describing how to use the components, a complete example of how to use SPINAS for a scattering amplitude, a discussion of the design and implementation useful for those wishing to contribute, and a discussion of our validation of this package, including both a validation of individual components of the package and a comparison of a complete set of Standard Model processes with Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g.\ $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy, or the rest of the cascade, is measured. We comment on applications involving the inelasticity distribution including measurements of the $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation affects flavor measurements and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Finally, for LHC's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Nucleation Rate in a High-Temperature Quantum Field Theory with Hard Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of thermal, hard particles on nucleation rates in high-temperature quantum field theories (QFTs). The hard particles, which form the heat bath for nucleating fields, can be regarded as the most qualitatively distinct aspect of high-temperature QFTs in comparison with Langer's classical nucleation theory: They have their own dynamics and interactions with the nucleating fields, and consequently they do not obey a purely equilibrium distribution during nucleation. We focus on the situation where the hard particles are correctly described by a Vlasov equation, and show that the hard particles can be included into Langer's framework, with only the dynamical part of the nucleation rate changing. The statistical part retains its form and is in accordance with the effective field theory approach to thermal nucleation. It is also shown that the dominant damping from a light bosonic quantum field comes from the corresponding long-wavelength classical field instead of the corresponding bosonic hard particles.</description>

      <title>Top anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment in the Bestest Little Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment (CMDM), $\hat{\mu}^{BLHM}_t$ of the top quark in the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM). We include new interactions with the involvement of the extended CKM matrix of the BLHM and we explore most of the allowed parameter space, obtaining multiple CMDM in the range of $10^{-4}-10^{-2}$. We consider experimental and model parameter uncertainties to integrate them into all our calculations using a Monte Carlo method. This enables us to determine the extent to which deviations arising from experimental errors can be accommodated within the statistical errors of the model and which relate to the physics framework of the BLHM, guiding future theory, phenomenological, and experimental research.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of the sign of gluon polarization in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the possible existence of negative gluon helicity, $\Delta g$, has been observed to be compatible with existing empirical constraints, including from jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC, and lattice QCD data on polarized gluon Ioffe time distributions. We perform a new global analysis of polarized parton distributions in the proton with new constraints from the high-$x$ region of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). A dramatic reduction in the quality of the fit for the negative $\Delta g$ replicas compared to those with positive $\Delta g$ suggest that the negative $\Delta g$ solution cannot simultaneously account for high-$x$ polarized DIS data along with lattice and polarized jet data.</description>

      <title>Probing the heavy Higgs boson production and decay $H_0$ of the Bestest Little Higgs Model at the LHC and the FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM) scenario, we analyze the branching ratios and production cross-section of the heavy Higgs boson $H_0$. The analysis is performed at the tree level and the one-loop level. In addition, we present results of the possible production of the heavy Higgs boson $H_0$ via gluon fusion for the center-of-mass energies and the integrated luminosities of the LHC, HE-LHC, HL-LHC, and FCC-hh. Our results show a very optimistic scenario for studying the $H_0$ scalar predicted by the BLHM and for the energies and luminosities of current and future hadron colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarises recent advances made in the calculation of the NNLO QCD corrections to the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ in the $B_s-\overline{B}_s$ system. The inclusion of the effects due to current-current operators leads to an updated prediction of $\Delta\Gamma_s = (0.076\pm 0.017)\,\text{ps}^{-1}$, which narrows the gap between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Suppression of diffraction in deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei and dynamical mechanism of leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the leading twist approach (LTA) to nuclear shadowing, we calculate the ratios of diffractive and usual parton distributions for a heavy nucleus (Pb) and the proton, $R_{A/p}=(f_{i/A}^{D(3)}/f_{i/A})/(f_{i/p}^{D(3)}/f_{i/p})$, for coherent and summed (coherent plus quasi-elastic) nuclear deep-inelastic scattering. We find that $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1$ for quarks and $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1.3$ for gluons in a broad range of $x$, which reaffirms the difference from the nuclear enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ predicted in the gluon saturation framework. We demonstrate that the magnitude of $R_{A/p}$ is controlled by the cross section of the interaction of hadronic fluctuations of the virtual photon with target nucleons, which explains an enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ in the color dipole model and its suppression in LTA. We argue that the black disk limit of LTA corresponds to $R_{A/p}=1$ and $R^{\rm coh}_{A/p}=0.86$ for the summed and coherent scattering, respectively. Relying on an intuitive definition of the saturation scale, we show that the ratio of the saturation scales of a heavy nucleus and proton $Q_{sA}^2(b)/Q_{sp}^2(b) \approx 1$ at small impact parameters $b$ due to the strong leading twist nuclear shadowing and diluteness of the nuclear density.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of the structure functions in momentum space based on the Laplace transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Laplace transform techniques, we describe the determination of the longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$, at the leading-order approximation in momentum space, from the structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ and its derivative with respect to ${\ln}Q^2$ in a kinematical region of low values of the Bjorken variable $x$. Since the $x$ dependence of $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and its evolution with $Q^2$ are determined much better by the data than $F_L(x,Q^2)$, this method provides both a direct check on $F_L(x,Q^2)$ where measured, and a way of extending $F_L(x,Q^2)$ into regions of $x$ and $Q^2$ where there are currently no data. In our calculations, we ultilize the Block-Durand-Ha parametrization for the structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ [M. M. Block, L. Durand and P. Ha, Phys.Rev.D {\bf89}, 094027 (2014)]. We find that the Laplace transform method in momentum space provides correct behaviors of the extracted longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$ and that our obtained results are in line with data from the H1 Collaboration and other results for $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$ obtained using Mellin transform method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In processes taking place at energies much higher than the weak scale, electroweak corrections can be taken into account by using electroweak evolution equations, that are analogous to the DGLAP equations in QCD. We show that weak isospin conservation in these equations imposes to modify the expressions of the splitting functions commonly used in the literature. These modifications have a profound impact on the parton distribution functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is derived from the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes in a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical description. As the original Black Hole Accretion Code, BHAC-QGP benefits from the use of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows us to dynamically adjust the resolution where necessary, and makes use of time-dependent Milne coordinates and the ultrarelativistic equation of state, $P = e/3$. We demonstrate that BHAC-QGP accurately passes a number of systematic and rigorous tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions. BHAC-QGP is based on the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes through the solution of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Like the mother code, BHAC-QGP uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows for a dynamic adjustment of the resolution in regions of the computational domain where a particularly high accuracy is needed. We here discuss a number of applications of BHAC-QGP to Au-Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies and show that the code is able to reproduce results of other simulations of these scenarios, but with much higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Axi-majoron for almost everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref. [1] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either inflationary Affleck-Dine mechanism or spontaneous leptogenesis thanks to the PQ-number asymmetry, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter can be purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution only with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves are expected to have information about some masse parameters of the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by at least a long-lived right-handed neutrino species.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm to Parallelise Parton Showers on a GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) paradigm of GPU programming does not support the branching nature of a parton shower algorithm by definition. However, modern GPUs are designed to schedule threads with diverging processes independently, allowing them to handle such branches. With regular thread synchronization and careful treatment of the individual steps, one can simulate a parton shower on a GPU. We present a parallelized Sudakov veto algorithm designed to simulate parton branching on multiple events simultaneously. We also release a CUDA C++ program that generates matrix elements, showers partons, and computes jet rates and event shapes for LEP at 91.2 GeV on a GPU. To benchmark its performance, we also provide a near-identical C++ program designed to simulate events serially on a CPU. While the consequences of branching are not absent, we demonstrate that a GPU can provide the throughput of a many-core CPU. As an example, we show that the time taken to simulate 10^6 events on one NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPU is equivalent to that of 266 Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs.</description>

      <title>Interpreting 95 GeV di-photon/$b\bar{b}$ excesses as a lightest Higgs boson of the MRSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) is a well motivated BSM model which can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson in agreement with electroweak precision observables, in particular with the $W$ boson mass and $T$ parameter. In the 2016 paper we showed that the SM-like 125 GeV Higgs state can be also realised as the second-to-lightest scalar of the MRSSM, leaving room for another sub-100 GeV state. Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of around 95 GeV we investigate the possibility whether this could be the lightest CP-even MRSSM scalar in a variation of our benchmarks presented in the 2016 work. We show that such a state can also simultaneously explain the excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state observed around the same mass value at LEP. Due to the R-symmetric nature of the model, a light singlet-like Higgs state leads necessarily to a light bino-singlino Dirac dark matter candidate, which can give a correct relic density while evading current experimental bounds. Dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario and point to parameter regions which are viable and of interest for the LHC Run III and upcoming dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Molecular pentaquarks with hidden charm and double strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze theoretically the coupled-channel meson-baryon interaction with global flavor $\bar c c s s n$ and $\bar c c s s s$, where mesons are pseudoscalars or vectors and baryons have $J ^P=1/2^+$ or $3/2^+$. The aim is to explore whether the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the unitarization process within coupled channels can dynamically generate double- and triple-strange pentaquark-type states ($P_{css}$ and $P_{csss}$ respectively), for which there is no experimental evidence to date. We evaluate the s-wave scattering matrix by implementing unitarity in coupled channels, using potential kernels obtained from t-channel vector meson exchange. The required $PPV$ and $VVV$ vertices are obtained from Lagrangians derived through appropriate extensions of the local hidden gauge symmetry approach to the charm sector, while capitalizing on the symmetry of the spin and flavor wave function to evaluate the $BBV$ vertex. We find four different poles in the double strange sector, some of them degenerate in spin. For the triple-strange channel we find the meson-baryon interaction insufficient to generate a bound or resonance state through the unitary coupled-channel dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We report the first search for the elastic scatterings between cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter and electrons in the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. Sub-MeV dark matter particles can be accelerated by scattering with electrons in the cosmic rays and produce detectable electron recoil signals in the detector. Using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year exposure, we set new constraints on DM-electron scattering cross sections for DM masses ranging from 10~eV/$c^2$ to 3~keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Inflation and reheating in quadratic metric-affine gravity with derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an updated model for nuclear $\pi^0$ photoproduction, which incorporates pion second-order rescattering on intermediate excited nuclear states. Our approach is based on the distorted wave impulse approximation in momentum space. The many-body medium effects are incorporated in the complex effective $\Delta$ self-energy, employing the results of the recently developed second-order pion-nucleus scattering potential. The experimental data for ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{40}$Ca are successfully described without the need to fit the model parameters of the photoproduction amplitude as a result of incorporating the second-order part of nuclear photoproduction potential, which involves intermediate nucleon spin-flip and charge exchange.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Effects of squared four-fermion operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory on meson mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a universal way of parametrizing New Physics (NP) manifesting as new, heavy particle interactions with the Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom, that respect the SM gauged symmetries. Higher order terms in the NP interactions possibly lead to sizable effects, mandatory for meaningful phenomenological studies, such as contributions to neutral meson mixing, which typically pushes the scale of NP to energy scales much beyond the reach of direct searches in colliders. I discuss the leading-order renormalization of double-insertions of dimension-6 four-fermion operators that change quark flavor by one unit (i.e., $ | \Delta F | = 1 $, $ F = $ strange-, charm-, or bottom-flavor), by dimension-8 operators relevant to meson mixing (i.e., $ | \Delta F | = 2 $) in SMEFT. Then, I consider the phenomenological implications of contributions proportional to large Yukawas, setting bounds on the Wilson coefficients of operators of dimension-6 via the leading logarithmic contributions. Given the underlying interest of SMEFT to encode full-fledged models at low energies, this work stresses the need to consider dimension-8 operators in phenomenological applications of dimension-6 operators of SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Cascades of high-energy SM particles in the primordial thermal plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy standard model (SM) particles in the early Universe are generated by the decay of heavy long-lived particles. The subsequent thermalization occurs through the splitting of high-energy primary particles into lower-energy daughters in primordial thermal plasma. The principal example of such processes is reheating after inflation caused by the decay of inflatons into SM particles. Understanding of the thermalization at reheating is extremely important as it reveals the origin of the hot Universe, and could open up new mechanisms for generating dark matter and/or baryon asymmetry. In this paper, we investigate the thermalization of high-energy SM particles in thermal plasma, taking into account the Landau--Pomeranchuk--Migdal effect in the leading-log approximation. The whole SM particle content and all the relevant SM interactions are included for the first time, i.e., the full gauge interactions of SU(3)$_c\times$SU(2)$_L\times$U(1)$_Y$ and the top Yukawa interaction. The distribution function of each SM species is computed both numerically and analytically. We have analytically obtained the distribution function of each SM species after the first few splittings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, after a sufficient number of splittings, the particle distributions are asymptotic to certain values at low momentum, independent of the high-energy particles injected by inflaton decay. The results are useful to calculate the DM abundance produced during the pre-thermal phase. An example is provided to illustrate a way to calculate the DM abundance from the scattering between the thermal plasma and high-energy particles in the cascade.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamization in hybrid Bjorken flow attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid fluid models, consisting of two sectors with more weakly and more strongly self-interacting degrees of freedom coupled consistently as in the semi-holographic framework, have been shown to exhibit an attractor surface for Bjorken flow. Retaining only the simple viscid fluid descriptions of both sectors, we find that, on the attractor surface, the hydrodynamization times of both subsectors decrease with increasing total energy density at the respective point of hydrodynamization following a conformal scaling, reach their minimum values, and subsequently rise rapidly. The minimum values are obtained when the respective energy densities are of the order of the inverse of the dimensionful inter-system coupling. Restricting to attractor curves which can be matched to glasma models at a time set by the saturation scale for both $p$-$p$ and Pb-Pb collisions, we find that the more weakly coupled sector hydrodynamizes much later, and the strongly coupled sector hydrodynamizes earlier in $p$-$p$ collisions, since the total energy densities at the respective hydrodynamization times of these sectors fall inside and outside of the conformal window. This holds true also for phenomenologically relevant solutions that are significantly away from the attractor surface at the time we match to glasma models.</description>

      <title>Target mass corrections in lepton--nucleus DIS: theory and applications to nuclear PDFs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide range of kinematics covered by current and planned deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) facilities, we revisit the formalism, practical implementation, and numerical impact of target mass corrections (TMCs) for DIS on unpolarized nuclear targets. An important aspect is that we only use nuclear and later partonic degrees of freedom, carefully avoiding a picture of the nucleus in terms of nucleons. After establishing that formulae used for individual nucleon targets $(p,n)$, derived in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) formalism, are indeed applicable to nuclear targets, we rewrite expressions for nuclear TMCs in terms of \mbox{re-scaled} (or averaged) kinematic variables. As a consequence, we find a representation for nuclear TMCs that is approximately independent of the nuclear target. We go on to construct a single-parameter fit for all nuclear targets that is in good numerical agreement with full computations of TMCs. We discuss in detail qualitative and quantitative differences between nuclear TMCs built in the OPE and the parton model formalisms, as well as give numerical predictions for current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the scalar unparticle and anomalous couplings at muon colliders in final states with multiple photons in the Randall- Sundrum model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of the scalar unparticle and anomalous couplings at muon colliders in final states with multiple photons in the Randall-Sundrum model is evaluated in detail. The results indicate that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-sections for the production of multiple photons depend strongly on the polarization of the muon beams, the parameters of unparticle physics (the scaling dimension $d_{U}$, operator $\mathcal{O}_{U}$, the energy scale $\Lambda_{U}$) and also the strength of anomalous couplings. Numerical evaluation shows that the cross-sections for the production of four photons in finale states with the contribution of scalar anomalous couplings are much larger than that of the unparticle under the same conditions. In the Higgs-radion mixing, the cross sections achieve the maximum value at the radion-dominated state, $m_{\phi} = 125$ GeV, in which the cross-section is much enhanced and can be measurable in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-charmed and singled charmed hadrons from coalescence: yields and ratios in different collision systems at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of charmed and multi-charmed hadrons in ultra-relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions coupling the transport approach for charm dynamics in the medium to an hybrid hadronization model of coalescence plus fragmentation. In this paper, we mainly discuss the particle yields for single charmed and multi-charmed baryons focusing mainly on the production of $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{ccc}$. We provide first predictions for PbPb collision in 0-10% centrality class and then we explore the system size dependence through KrKr, to ArAr and OO collisions, planned within the ALICE3 experiment. In these cases, a monotonic behavior for the yields emerges which can be tested in future experimental data. We found about three order of magnitude increase in the production of $\Omega_{ccc}$ in PbPb collisions compared with the yield in small collision systems like OO collisions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on the $\Omega_{ccc}$ particle production and spectra coming from the modification of the charm quark distribution due to the different size of the collision systems comparing also to the case of thermalized charm distributions. These results suggest that observation on the $\Omega_{ccc}$ spectra and their evolution across system size can give information about the partial thermalization of the charm quark distribution as well as to its wave function width.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and the $N^*(1440)$ Roper resonance in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electroexcitation of the ${\cal N}^*(1440)$ Roper resonance, which defines the first radially excited state of the nucleon, is examined within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. Such excited Fock states are characterized by the leading three-quark component, which determines the main properties of Roper resonance. The differential configurational entropy (DCE) was used in the nuclear interaction with a gauge vector field for ${\cal N}^*(1440)$ transition. Comparing the main results with the recent data of the CLAS Collaboration at JLab shows a good agreement on the accuracy of the computed data.</description>

      <title>Probing Zee-Babu states at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zee-Babu model is a minimal realization of radiative neutrino mass generation mechanism at the two-loop level. We study the phenomenology of this model at future multi-TeV muon colliders. After imposing all theoretical and low-energy experimental constraints on the model parameters, we find that the Zee-Babu states are expected not to reside below the TeV scale, making it challenging to probe them at the LHC. We first analyze the production rates for various channels, including multi singly-charged and/or doubly-charged scalars at muon colliders. For concreteness, we study several benchmark points that satisfy neutrino oscillation data and other constraints and find that most channels have large production rates. We then analyze the discovery reach of the model using two specific channels: the pair production of singly- and doubly-charged scalars. For the phenomenologically viable scenarios considered in this study, charged scalars with masses up to ${\cal O}(3$--$4)$ TeV can be probed for the center-of-mass energy of $10$ TeV and total luminosity of $10~{\rm ab}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Polarized TMD fragmentation functions for $J/\psi$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the matching, at leading order, of the transverse momentum-dependent fragmentation functions (TMDFFs) for light quarks and gluons fragmenting to a $J/\psi$ onto polarized nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) TMDFFs. The NRQCD TMDFFs have an operator-product-expansion in terms of nonperturbative NRQCD production matrix elements. Using the results we obtain, we make predictions for the light quark fragmentation contribution to the production of polarized $J/\psi$ in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) both for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized beams. These results are an important contribution to polarized $J/\psi$ production in SIDIS, and thus are needed for comparison with experiments at the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports on a method for uncertainty estimation in simulated collider-event predictions. The method is based on a Monte Carlo-veto algorithm, and extends previous work on uncertainty estimates in parton showers by including uncertainty estimates for the Lund string-fragmentation model. This method is advantageous from the perspective of simulation costs: a single ensemble of generated events can be reinterpreted as though it was obtained using a different set of input parameters, where each event now is accompanied with a corresponding weight. This allows for a robust exploration of the uncertainties arising from the choice of input model parameters, without the need to rerun full simulation pipelines for each input parameter choice. Such explorations are important when determining the sensitivities of precision physics measurements. Accompanying code is available at https://gitlab.com/uchep/mlhad-weights-validation.</description>

      <title>NLO corrections to the deeply virtual meson production revisited: impact on the extraction of generalized parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD corrections for the deeply virtual meson production (DVMP) process, exploring its phenomenology both in isolation and in a multichannel fit combined with deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Our approach involves the conformal partial wave (CPaW) formalism, which allows for the straightforward inclusion of higher-order contributions and evolutionary effects. Our findings indicate that a description of the longitudinal component of the vector meson DVMP cross-section at high energies is achievable only at NLO within the standard collinear approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate a simultaneous description of DIS, DVCS, and DVMP processes, providing insights into the proton structure described at NLO by unique universal generalized parton distribution (GPD) functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we study the tensor and vector exchange contributions to the elastic reactions involving the pseudoscalars mesons $\pi^+ \pi^-$, $K^{+}K^{-}$ and $D^{+}D^{-}$. In the case of the tensor-exchange contributions we assume that an intermediate tensor $f_2(1270)$ is dynamically generated from the interaction of two virtual $\rho$ mesons, with the use of a pole approximation. The calculation of the two-loop amplitude is facilitated since the triangle loops can be factorized and computed separately. The results show very small contributions coming from the tensor-exchange mechanisms when compared with those from the vector-exchange processes. We compare our results for $\pi \pi$ and $K\bar{K}$ scattering with those obtained in other works where the $f_2(1270)$ is considered as an ordinary $q\bar{q}$ meson. Our picture provides a smaller contribution but of similar order of magnitude for pion scattering and stabilizes the results in the case of $K\bar{K}$, allowing us to make estimates for $D\bar{D}$ scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the "scalon", which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we show that this assumption is not always correct. In fact, we demonstrate the existence of two scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Detecting defect dynamics in relativistic field theories far from equilibrium using topological data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium dynamics of relativistic $N$-component scalar field theories in Minkowski space-time in a classical-statistical regime, where typical occupation numbers of modes are much larger than unity. In this strongly correlated system far from equilibrium, the role of different phenomena such as nonlinear wave propagation and defect dynamics remains to be clarified. We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the nonequilibrium many-body system for different numbers of field components $N$ via a hierarchy of cubical complexes. Specifically, we show that the persistent homology of local energy density fluctuations can give rise to signatures of self-similar scaling associated with topological defects, distinct from the scaling behaviour of nonlinear wave modes. This contributes to the systematic understanding of the role of topological defects for far-from-equilibrium time evolutions of nonlinear many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: True muonium (TM) -- the bound state of $\mu^+\mu^-$ -- has not been discovered yet. It was demonstrated that searching for TM via $\gamma\gamma$ fusions in heavy ion collisions is feasible due to the enhancement of the atom number. We study the production of the true para-muonium (pTM) in the collisions of linearly polarized photons in the experiments of heavy-ion collisions, calculate the production rate as well as the transverse spectrum of pTM, and explore the discovery potential in nuclear experiments. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the linearly polarized photon distribution and the transverse momentum distribution of pTM. The optimal kinematic region of the generated pTM is identified, which can provide a theoretical guide to the detection of pTM in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Chiral Quark-Soliton Model used previously to describe baryons with one heavy quark to the case of heavy tetraquarks. We argue, that the model is insenstive to the nature of the heavy object bound by the soliton, i.e. to its mass and spin. Therefore, a heavy quark can be replaced by an anti-diquark without modifying the soliton background. Diquark dynamics is taken into account by means of the nonrelarivistic Schr\"odinger equation with the Cornell potential. We fix the Cornell potential parameters from the charmonia and bottomia spectra. We first compute $B_c$ meson masses to check our fitting procedure, and then compute diquark masses by appropriately rescaling color factors in the Cornell potential. We ten compute tetraquark masses and confirm previous findings that only $bb$ tetraquarks are bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian lattice formulation of SU(3) gauge theory opens the possibility for quantum simulations of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. The limitations of these truncations are explored using Monte Carlo methods. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a $5\times5$ and $8\times8$ lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of next-to-eikonal corrections on dijet production in Deep Inelastic Scattering off nuclear targets in the framework of the Color Glass Condensate. They require the knowledge of correlators of fields in the target beyond those computed in the standard McLerran-Venugopalan model, specifically those between transverse and boost-enhanced components, and of the recoil of the fields. We neglect the latter, while for the former we develop a linear model valid for large nuclei. We considered the unpolarized cross sections for dijet production in the approximation of a homogenous dilute nucleus, obtaining simple analytic expressions for the cross sections at nex-to-eikonal accuracy, valid in the limit of total dijet momentum and dijet momentum imbalance larger than the saturation scale of the nucleus. We perform a numerical study of the results at energies of the Electron Ion Collider, finding $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ effects in the cross sections at large total momentum. We also analyze the azimuthal asymmetries between total momentum and imbalance, finding that non-eikonal corrections induce odd azimuthal harmonics for the situation of jets with equal momentum fractions from the virtual photon, where they are absent in the eikonal approximation. Finally, in the eikonal approximation we have compared the results of our analytic expansion valid in the dilute limit of the target, and the full Color Glass Condensate results in the McLerran-Venugopalan model and their correlation limit. Our analytic expressions match the correlation limit ones in the region where both should be simultaneously valid and reproduce very well the full Color Glass Condensate results in its validity region.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Wave Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) can detect disturbances in the fabric of spacetime on a galactic scale by monitoring the arrival time of pulses from millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recent advancements have enabled the use of $\gamma$-ray radiation emitted by MSPs, in addition to radio waves, for PTA experiments. Wave dark matter (DM), a prominent class of DM candidates, can be detected with PTAs due to its periodic perturbations of the spacetime metric. In response to this development, we perform in this Letter a first analysis of applying the $\gamma$-ray PTA to detect the ultralight axion-like wave DM, with the data of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Despite its much smaller collecting area, the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray PTA demonstrates a promising sensitivity potential. We show that the upper limits not far from those of the dedicated radio-PTA projects can be achieved. Moreover, we initiate a cross-correlation analysis using the data of two Fermi-LAT pulsars. The cross-correlation of phases, while carrying key information on the source of the spacetime perturbations, has been ignored in the existing data analyses for the wave DM detection with PTAs. Our analysis indicates that taking this information into account can improve the sensitivity to wave DM by $\gtrsim 50\%$ at masses below $10^{-23}$ eV.</description>

Abstract: We study the space and properties of global and local observables for radiation emitted in the scattering of a massive scalar field in gauge and gravitational plane-wave backgrounds, in both the quantum and classical theory. We first compute the radiated momentum and angular momentum flow, demonstrating that they are good local observables determined by the amplitude and phase of the waveform. We then focus on the corresponding global observables, which in the gravitational case requires dealing with the collinear divergence of the gravitational Compton cross-section. We show using the KLN theorem that we can obtain an infrared-finite cross-section only by summing over forward scattering diagrams; this suggests dressing the initial state in the direction collinear to the plane wave in order to be able to compute observables integrated over the celestial sphere. Finally, we explore the high-energy behaviour of our observables. We find that classical global observables generically exhibit a power-law mass divergence in electrodynamics and a logarithmic mass divergence in gravity, even when radiation reaction is included. We then show explicitly how this is consistently resolved in the full quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Momentum Shell in Quarkyonic Matter from Explicit Duality: A Dual Model for Cold, Dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of cold QCD matter that bridges nuclear and quark matter through the duality relation between quarks and baryons. The baryon number and energy densities are expressed as functionals of either the baryon momentum distribution, $f_{\rm B}$, or the quark distribution, $f_{\rm Q}$, which are subject to the constraints on fermions, $0 \le f_{\rm B,Q} \le 1$. The theory is ideal in the sense that the confinement of quarks into baryons is reflected in the duality relation between $f_{\rm Q}$ and $f_{\rm B}$, while other possible interactions among quarks and baryons are all neglected. The variational problem with the duality constraints is formulated and we explicitly construct analytic solutions, finding two distinct regimes: A nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, baryons underoccupy states at low momenta but form a momentum shell with $f_{\rm B}=1$ on top of a quark Fermi sea. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the pressure.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the gamma-ray and high energy neutrino fluxes from the circumstellar interaction of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent supernova, SN 2023ixf, one of the closest observed type II SNe has revealed the presence of a dense circumstellar material (CSM). Interaction of the SN ejecta with this dense CSM might create high energy protons of PeV energies through shock acceleration. These accelerated protons then colliding with the CSM (inelastic $pp$ collision) can produce secondaries such as high energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. However, no gamma-rays and neutrinos have been detected by Fermi-LAT and IceCube from this event. Fermi-LAT has placed an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux above $100$~MeV to be $2.6 \times 10^{-11}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. On the other hand, IceCube's upper limit on muon neutrino flux is $7.3\times 10^{-2} ~\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$. {\color{black} Taking these limits into account and using the shock-CSM properties derived from multi-wavelength observations, we obtain new upper limits on the gamma-ray ($10^{-11}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$) and neutrino ($10^{-3}~\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$) fluxes from SN 2023ixf produced via the $pp$ interaction channel.} While we found the gamma-ray flux to be consistent with Fermi-LAT's upper limit, the neutrino flux is found to be about $2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the IceCube's upper limit. We further analyse the detection prospects of such secondary signals from future SN 2023 like events with upcoming detectors, CTA and IceCube-Gen2 and found to have great discovery potential, if any similar event occurs within $7$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Alternative scenarios for the LHC based electron-proton collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Construction of the ERLC (twin LC) collider tangential to LHC will give opportunity to investigate ep collisions at essentially higher center-of-mass energies than ERL50 and LHC based ep collider. Luminosity estimations show that values well exceeding 10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1} can be achieved for ERLC and HL-LHC based ep colliders. Certainly, proposed ep colliders have great potential for clarifying QCD basics and new physics search in addition to providing precise PDFs for adequate interpretation of LHC experimental data. Another alternative to the ERL50 is to construct an e-ring with the same energy and length. In this case, 4.2x10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1} luminosity can be reached. The advantage of this option is that the {\mu}-ring can be installed instead of the e-ring as a next stage, which will allow it to reach a much higher center of mass energy.</description>

      <title>(Multi-field) Natural Inflation and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of natural inflation with a periodic non-minimal coupling, which is a well-motivated inflationary model that admits an explicit UV completion. We demonstrate that this construction can satisfy the most recent observational constraints from Planck and the BICEP/Keck collaborations. We also compute the corresponding relic gravitational wave background due to tensor perturbations and show that future space-borne interferometers, such as DECIGO, BBO and ALIA, may be able to detect it. Next, we extend this analysis and establish the validity of these results in a multi-field model featuring an additional $R^2$ term in the action, which allows us to interpolate between natural and scalaron (a.k.a.~Starobinsky) inflation. We investigate the conditions under which the aforementioned future interferometers will have the capability to differentiate between pure natural inflation and natural-scalaron inflation. The latter analysis could open the door to distinguishing between single-field and multi-field inflation through gravitational wave observations in more general contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of recent interest in high-frequency detectors, broad features of gravitational wave signals from phase transitions taking place soon after inflation are summarized. The influence of the matter domination era that follows the slow-roll stage is quantified in terms of two equilibration rates. Turning to the highest-frequency part of the spectrum, we show how it is constrained by the fact that the bubble distance scale must exceed the mean free path.</description>

      <title>Non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The production of a heavy-quark pair is well-described by perturbative QCD, whereas the formation of the bound state involves non-perturbative processes, treated in different ways by various available theoretical models. ALICE can measure inclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ at both forward and midrapidity down to low ${p_{\rm T}}$ and the prompt and non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ separation can be performed at midrapidity. The study of the production of non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ originating from the decay of beauty hadrons, besides allowing to isolate the prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section from the inclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section, can be used to estimate open beauty-hadron production. Heavy-flavour particle production in pp collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity can provide insight into the processes occuring in the collision at the partonic level, as well as the interplay between the hard and soft mechanisms in particle production.</description>

      <title>Infrared fixed point in the massless twelve-flavor SU(3) gauge-fermion system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong numerical evidence for the existence of an infrared fixed point in the renormalization group flow of the SU(3) gauge-fermion system with twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation. Our numerical simulations using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions with Pauli-Villars improvement do not exhibit any first-order bulk phase transition in the investigated parameter region. We utilize an infinite volume renormalization scheme based on the gradient flow transformation to determine the renormalization group $\beta$ function. We identify an infrared fixed point at $g^2_{\mathrm{GF}\star}=6.60(62)$ in the GF scheme and calculate the leading irrelevant critical exponent $\gamma_{g}^{\star}=0.199(32)$. Our prediction for $\gamma_{g}^{\star}$ is consistent with available literature at the $1\mbox{-}2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Amplitudes in Power-Law FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlators of large-scale fluctuations belong to the most important observables in modern cosmology. Recently, there have been considerable efforts in analytically understanding the cosmological correlators and the related wavefunction coefficients, which we collectively call cosmological amplitudes. In this work, we provide a set of simple rules to directly write down analytical answers for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes of conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in power-law FRW universe. With the recently proposed family-tree decomposition method, we identify an over-complete set of multivariate hypergeometric functions, called family trees, to which all tree-level conformal scalar amplitudes can be easily reduced. Our method yields series expansions and monodromies of family trees in various kinematic limits, together with a large number of functional identities. The family trees are in a sense generalizations of polylogarithms and do reduce to polylogarithmic expressions for the cubic coupling in inflationary limit. We further show that all family trees can be decomposed into linear chains by taking shuffle products of all subfamilies, with which we find simple connection between bulk time integrals and boundary energy integrals.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>
