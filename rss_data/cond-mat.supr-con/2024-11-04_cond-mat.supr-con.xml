      <title>Out-of-plane bond order phase, superconductivity, and their competition in the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model for pressurized nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long standing problem. Motivated by this we have assumed that nickelates belong to the category of strongly correlated systems, and considered the bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model as a minimal model, where $J_\parallel$ and $J_\perp$ are the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic exchange, respectively. We have studied the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a promising candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we remarkably find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.</description>

      <title>In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>Optical absorptions activated by an ultrashort halfcycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort halfcycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort halfcycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Axion detection via superfluid $^3$He ferromagnetic phase and quantum measurement techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to use the nuclear spin excitation in the ferromagnetic A1 phase of the superfluid $^3$He for the axion dark matter detection. This approach is striking in that it is sensitive to the axion-nucleon coupling, one of the most important features of the QCD axion introduced to solve the strong CP problem. We review a quantum mechanical description of the nuclear spin excitation and apply it to the estimation of the axion-induced spin excitation rate. We also describe a possible detection method of the spin excitation in detail and show that the combination of the squeezing of the final state with the Josephson parametric amplifier and the homodyne measurement can enhance the sensitivity. It turns out that this approach gives good sensitivity to the axion dark matter with the mass of $O(1) \, \mu \mathrm{eV}$ depending on the size of the external magnetic field. We estimate the parameters of experimental setups, e.g., the detector volume and the amplitude of squeezing, required to reach the QCD axion parameter space.</description>
