      <title>Control of a Uniformly Magnetized Plasma with External Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of plasmas is a challenging topic. We study a control problem for plasma living in a uniform external magnetic field. Linear analysis for any equilibrium $\mu$ is investigated through the Laplace-Fourier transform approach. Moreover, the Penrose condition, which characterizes the stability of equilibrium, is derived for Bernstein modes and verified numerically. Based on the linear analysis, a general control strategy is introduced, with recovering the free-streaming solution as a specific example. We finally present several examples to control instabilities, including Gaussian equilibria and Dory-Guest-Harris instability.</description>

      <title>Modeling Low-Temperature Plasmas Simulating Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study presented here, we model the gas phase chemistry induced by plasma discharge at low temperature (150 K) in the NASA Ames COSmIC Simulation Chamber (COSmIC) using a 1-dimensional multi-fluid plasma model named CO-PRISM (COSmIC Plasma Reactivity and Ionization Simulation Model). Our model incorporates an extensive chemical reaction network to simulate the neutral-neutral and ion-neutral reactions occurring in the COSmIC experiments when using N2-CH4-based gas mixtures relevant to Titan's atmosphere. Our reaction network now includes crucial reactions involving the first electronically-excited state of atomic nitrogen, recent electron collision cross-sections, and radical chemistry. In particular, we have investigated the influence of C2H2 on the gas phase polymeric growth and the elemental composition of the chemical products, and we have compared our findings to recently published solid phase analyses. The modeling results are consistent with experimental measurements of N2-CH4-C2H2 plasmas on COSmIC, showing the production of C6Hx intermediates and precursors of larger organics, as well as methanimine in small concentration. Our numerical results point to cationic pathways enabling efficient intermediate-sized and nitrogen-rich \ce{C2H2}-driven chemistry driving tholin production. Comparison of the modeled gas phase elemental composition with elemental composition of the solid phase samples produced in COSmIC reveal similar trends, with C/N increasing when C2H2 is present in the gas mixture. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of such synergistic studies using low-temperature plasma chemistry experiments combined with modeling efforts to improve our understanding of cold planetary environments.</description>

      <title>Particle-In-Cell Informed Kinetic Modeling of Nonlinear Skin Effects in Low-Frequency Inductively Coupled Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform extensive 2D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) electromagnetic simulations of low pressure Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges with various coil current and driving frequencies. Our simulations show that in low-frequency cases, electrons in the skin region near the coil can be predominantly magnetized by the Radio Frequency (RF) magnetic field. More specifically, the electrons are trapped in the combined potential well formed by the vector and electrostatic potentials, where they oscillate for most of the RF period while drifting perpendicular to the RF magnetic field. When the magnetic field weakens, electrons shortly demagnetize, leading to jet-like currents and periodic bursts of energy deposition. Based on the newly discovered electron trajectories, we develop a new kinetic theory for the plasma skin effect in low-frequency Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges, incorporating nonlinear electron motion in an RF magnetic field by integrating Vlasov equation along the unperturbed particle trajectory. This theory successfully predicts the time evolution of electron currents in low-frequency ICP plasmas, as well as a nonlinear relation between electron current and the RF inductive electric field in the new regime we found. Furthermore, by coupling this new kinetic theory with a global model, we provide a straightforward method for estimating equilibrium electron temperature, plasma density and electron current. These analytical predictions match well with our 2D PIC simulations and can be validated through future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Geometrical optics in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrical optics (GO) is widely used for reduced modeling of waves in plasmas but fails near reflection points, where it predicts a spurious singularity of the wave amplitude. We show how to avoid this singularity by adopting a different representation of the wave equation. Instead of the physical space $x$ and the wavevector $k$, we use the ray time $\tau$ as the new canonical coordinate and the ray energy $h$ as the associated canonical momentum. To derive the envelope equation in the $\tau$-representation, we construct the Weyl symbol calculus on the $(\tau, h)$ space and show that the corresponding Weyl symbols are related to their $(x, k)$ counterparts by the Airy transform. This allows us to express the coefficients in the envelope equation through the known properties of the original dispersion operator. When necessary, solutions of this equation can be mapped to the $x$-space using a generalised metaplectic transform. But the field per se might not even be needed in practice. Instead, knowing the corresponding Wigner function usually suffices for linear and quasilinear calculations. As a Weyl symbol itself, the Wigner function can be mapped analytically, using the aforementioned Airy transform. We show that the standard Airy patterns that form in regions where conventional GO fails are successfully reproduced within MGO simply by remapping the field from the $\tau$-space to the $x$-space. An extension to mode-converting waves is also presented. This formulation, which we call generalised metaplectic GO (MGO) offers a promising tool, for example, for reduced modeling of the O--X conversion in inhomogeneous plasma near the critical density, an effect that is important for fusion applications and also occurs in the ionosphere. Aside from better handling reflection, MGO is similar to GO and can replace it for any practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Proton-Acoustic Wave Effects on the Relaxation of Proton Transverse Heating in Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse electromagnetic and electrostatic plasma wave modes propagating along a background magnetic field $\vec{B}_0$ are independent according to linear kinetic theory. However, resonant interactions and energy exchange between waves and particles break this linear decoupling. This work tracks the coupled evolution of Alfv\'en-cyclotron (ACWs) and Ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) by solving moment-based quasilinear equations for a collisionless plasma of bi-Maxwellian protons and Maxwellian electrons. Unlike earlier quasilinear studies that adopt the cold-electron limit, our formulation retains the full kinetic response of both species, treating the electrons as a thermal reservoir to isolate proton heating. A parameter survey over $0.01\leq\beta_{\parallel p}\leq10$ and $1\le T_e/T_p\le10$ shows that an ambient spectrum of ACWs can drive significant perpendicular proton heating and raise the temperature anisotropy from initially isotropic conditions at low $\beta_{\parallel p}\lesssim0.1$, thereby triggering cyclotron instabilities. The quasilinear evolution self-regulates the ACW, driving the system toward a quasi-stationary state with $\gamma/\Omega_p&lt;10^{-1}$ and reduced anisotropy. As $T_e/T_p$ increases, IAWs become less damped and absorb a larger share of the fluctuation energy through Landau resonance, reducing the efficiency of ACW-driven proton heating and thus regulating the instability. For sufficiently large $\beta_{\parallel p}$ or $T_e/T_p\gtrsim5$, ACWs become inefficient drivers of perpendicular heating, leaving IAWs as the dominant dissipation channel. These results explain how modest electrostatic activity in low-$\beta$ environments such as the inner heliosphere and planetary magnetosheaths can regulate, but not indefinitely sustain, cyclotron instabilities.</description>

      <title>Modeling of convective cells, turbulence, and transport induced by a radio-frequency antenna in the tokamak boundary plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge turbulence model Hermes (Dudson et al., 2017 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 59 05401) is set up for plasma boundary simulations with an RF antenna, using parameters characteristic of a tokamak edge. Cartesian slab geometry is used with thin plate limiters representing the ICRF antenna side-wall limiters. Ad-hoc DC electric biasing of the limiters, motivated by calculations with VSim (Nieter et al., J. Comput. Phys. 196, 448 (2004)), represents an induced RF sheath rectified potential in the plasma turbulence model. Flux-driven turbulence simulations demonstrate a realistic distribution of plasma profiles and fluctuations. There is a clear effect of the antenna sheath voltage leading to formation of convective cells; bias-induced convective transport flattens the SOL density profile and fluctuations penetrate into the shadow region of the limiters as the bias voltage increases. Turbulent transport for impurity ions is inferred by following ion trajectories in the simulated plasma turbulence fields, showing Bohm-like effective diffusion rates. All in all, the model elucidates the key physical phenomena governing the effects of ICRF-induced antenna biasing on the tokamak boundary plasma.</description>

      <title>Optimal Landau-type closure parameters for two-fluid simulations of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Heavy Ions at Non-Relativistic Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of particles with mass number to charge number ratios $A/Q &gt; 1$, e.g., partially-ionized heavy ions. To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong, symmetrically focusing plasma lenses are promising for accommodating the small beams associated with plasma-based accelerators and collider final foci. However, while focusing with active and passive plasma lenses has been experimentally demonstrated, compatibility with high-brightness beams relevant for applications has not. In this Letter, we show experimentally that passive plasma lenses can preserve free-electron-laser-quality slice emittance while focusing two orders of magnitude more strongly than quadrupole magnets, and that the focal parameters can be controlled.</description>

      <title>Restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration through low rank tensor approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov-Poisson equation. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the numerical flow iteration after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using the blackbox approximation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure numerical flow iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the numerical flow iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale two-dimensional compressed-sheared non-diffusive convective flows of a magnetized plasma generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the self-consistent evolution of the plasma and of the electrostatic field on the microscales, commensurable with the wavelength of the microscale instabilities and of the ion gyroradius, as well as on the macroscales of a bulk of plasma, is accounted for. It includes the theory of the formation of the macroscale spatially inhomogeneous compressed-sheared convective flows by the inhomogeneous microturbulence, the theory of the back reaction of the macroscale convected flows on the microturbulence, and of the slow macroscale responce of a bulk of plasma on the development of the compressed-sheared convective flows.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05456v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokamaks differ fundamentally from stellarators in the importance of the external coils in determining the magnetic field structure. Tokamak plasmas are in a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating dominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields produced by the coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are not easily controlled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full stability range produces only a small change, $\sim 16\%$, in the poloidal flux produced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why disruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though difficult seems to be required, especially during shutdown. The rapid temporal decay of $n\tau_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for the careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications of Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The context of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications of the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, should be helpful in the design of tokamak power plants. (2) Thoughtful allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts is needed to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Tokamak Disruptions with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many disruptions are caused by resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM). A database of DIII-D locked mode disruptions provides two main disruption criteria, which are shown to be signatures of RWTMs. The first is that the q = 2 rational surface must be sufficiently close the resistive wall surrounding the plasma to interact with it. If active feedback is used, this implies that RWTMs can be prevented from causing major disruptions. This is demonstrated in simulations. The second criterion is that the current profile is sufficiently peaked. This is caused by edge cooling, such as by impurity radiation and turbulence, which suppress edge current and temperature. This implies the disruptions are not caused by neoclassical tearing modes (NTM), because the bootstrap current is also suppressed. The dependence of the critical internal inductance on elongation is given, which suggests that elongation might be used as an actuator to prevent disruptions. At high $\beta,$ resistive wall modes (RWM) can be stabilized with feedback. Feedback also stabilizes high $\beta$ RWTMs, as shown in NSTX data and in simulations. These results suggest that RWTM disruptions in ITER might be prevented using the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) coils.</description>

      <title>Phase space transport, quasilinear diffusion and locality in phase velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the motion of charged particles subjected to a discrete spectrum of electrostatic waves. We focus on situations when transport dominates, leading to significant variations in particle velocity. Nonetheless, these velocity changes remain finite due to the presence of KAM tori bounding phase space. We analyze the conditions under which transport can be modeled as a diffusion process and evaluate the relevance of the so-called quasilinear value of the diffusion coefficient. We distinguish between traditional quasilinear diffusion, when wave-particle interaction is perturbative, and the so-called chaotic regime of diffusion, when the particle motion looks erratic. In the perturbative regime, we demonstrate both numerically and theoretically that diffusion occurs only when wave-particle interaction is local in phase velocity; that is, when wave contributions from phase velocities far from the particles instantaneous velocities are negligible. Conversely, numerical results indicate that chaotic diffusion can occur even when wave-particle interaction is not local. Furthermore, in regimes when quasilinear diffusion is applicable, we introduce a simple analytical expression for the time evolution of the velocity distribution function, that accounts for phase space boundaries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>
