      <title>Goal assembly as a formalism of evolvable design</title>

Abstract: In the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, a unified understanding of technology and biology is critically needed but still lacking. A cornerstone of such unification is evolvable design. I present a formalism, called goal assembly, that unifies three key characteristics of evolvable, biology-like design: (i) hierarchical integration of small competencies into larger competencies; (ii) highly non-uniform (power-law or log-normal distributed) representation of phenotypes by genotypes; and (iii) evolution of hierarchical modularity. It does so by making the hierarchy of physical goal states corresponding to substructures explicit, focusing on their composition across scales. In particular, higher-level goal variables approximate achievable joint goal states of interacting lower-level goal variables. Mechanisms of evolvability include goal state gradient backpropagation across scales, hierarchical decision making among alternative goal states, and structural recombination of modules. In learning theory terms, goal assembly proposes architectural inductive biases of emergent engineering systems operating at a complexity regime where goals arise as necessary abstractions. Beyond asking what goals are and how they are achieved, goal assembly suggests we can almost independently talk about their compositionality.</description>

      <title>The Value of Information in Multi-Scale Feedback Systems</title>

Abstract: Complex adaptive systems (CAS) can be described as systems of information flows dynamically interacting across scales in order to adapt and survive. CAS often consist of many components that work towards a shared goal, and interact across different informational scales through feedback loops, leading to their adaptation. In this context, understanding how information is transmitted among system components and across scales becomes crucial for understanding the behavior of CAS. Shannon entropy, a measure of syntactic information, is often used to quantify the size and rarity of messages transmitted between objects and observers, but it does not measure the value that information has for each specific observer. For this, semantic and pragmatic information have been conceptualized as describing the influence on an observer's knowledge and actions. Building on this distinction, we describe the architecture of multi-scale information flows in CAS through the concept of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems, and propose a series of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information measures to quantify the value of information flows. While the measurement of values is necessarily context-dependent, we provide general guidelines on how to calculate semantic and pragmatic measures, and concrete examples of their calculation through four case studies: a robotic collective model, a collective decision-making model, a task distribution model, and a hierarchical oscillator model. Our results contribute to an informational theory of complexity, aiming to better understand the role played by information in the behavior of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between population profile and optimal routes in U.S. cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities have developed over time alongside advancements in civilization, focusing on efficient travel and reducing costs. Many studies have examined the distinctive features of urban road networks, such as their length, efficiency, connection to population density, and other properties. However, the relationship between car routes and population in city structures remains unclear. In this study, we used the center of mass for each city tract, defined by the US Census, as the origins and destinations for our itineraries. We calculated travel time, and both Euclidean and travel distances for sixty major cities. We discovered that the total sum of all routes adheres to an urban law. The distribution of these car journeys follows Weibull functions, suggesting that the urban center plays a crucial role in optimizing routes across multiple cities. We also developed a simple point pattern model for the population, which aligns with the well-known decreasing exponential density expression. Our findings show that the interplay between population and path optimization influences city structure through its center. This study offers a new perspective on the fundamental principles that shape urban design.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.</description>
