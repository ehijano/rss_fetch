      <title>On extracting momentum from supports: the bullet in the beam problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain insights into momentum transfer from the supporting environment, we consider the simple problem of a bullet, fired from below, into a wooden beam resting on two supports. The resulting upward velocity of the beam strongly depends on where the bullet enters the beam; this dependence is due to upward momentum extracted by the beam from its supports. Our simple example illustrates the momentum transfer mechanism exploited in the remarkable dynamics of the chain fountain.</description>

      <title>CFD modeling of hydrogen release and dispersion in a congested container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen plays an important role in driving decarbonization within the current global energy landscape. As hydrogen infrastructures rapidly expand beyond their traditional applications, there is a need for comprehensive safety practices, solutions, and regulations. Within this framework, the dispersion of hydrogen in enclosed facilities presents a significant safety concern due to its potential for explosive accidents. In this study, hydrogen dispersion in a confined and congested environment (37 m${}^3$ container) is studied using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The experimental setup mirrors previous INERIS investigations, featuring a centrally located hydrogen injection point on the floor with a 20 mm diameter injector and a release rate of 35 g/s, resulting in a Froude number of 650. This yields an inertial jet and a challenging dispersion scenario for numerical prediction. Concentration mapping is carried out by 3 oxygen analyzers distributed throughout the 37 m3 chamber. Comparisons are made between the measured and numerical data to validate the solver used under such conditions. Best practice guidelines are followed, and sensitivity studies involving grid refinement and boundary conditions are conducted to ensure robust simulation results. The findings highlight the model's ability to reproduce the hydrogen concentration distribution for both empty and congested containers and underline the role of accounting for leakages in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scale effects methodology applied to uprising jets in ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CEA is involved in the development of the 4 th generation of nuclear reactors, among which are the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactors (SFR). To support their design and safety, specific codes were developed and should be validated using experimental results from relevant mock-ups. Due to the complexity of building a fullsized prototype in the nuclear field, most of the experiments are performed on reduced-sized models but it may lead to scale effects. Such scale effects are under study in this paper, focusing on a critical issue in SFR reactor, which is the rising of the jet outgoing the core at low power. For this purpose, a scale effects methodology is detailed, using the SFR's reduced scale mock-up MICAS as the reference scale. To achieve that, dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations under Boussinesq's approximation are considered and the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem is applied to determine the most relevant dimensionless numbers, among them the densimetric Froude number. Experimental campaigns have been performed to measure velocity fields using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Their analysis clearly shown dependency of mean pathway of the jet on this dimensionless number. Particularly, plotting the jet angle as a function of the normalized densimetric Froude number, a change of behaviour for a threshold value of 0.45 has been observed. This result also shown negligible effects on the jet rise happening before jet impingement on the Upper Core Structure (UCS).</description>
