      <title>Verification of Electromagnetic Fully-kinetic Symplectic Particle-in-cell Method in Microinstabilities Simulation of</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symplectic electromagnetic fully-kinetic particle-in-cell simulation of microinstabilities in plasma, using parameters from the Cyclone Base Case [Dimits, et al., Physics of Plasmas 7, 969 (2000)]. The results show that the growth rates of unstable modes, including ion temperature gradient (ITG), trapped electron mode (TEM), and kinetic ballooning mode (KBM), are consistent with those obtained from previous gyrokinetic models. Additionally, the \b{eta}-stabilization of the ITG is reproduced. The analysis also reveals that the impact of the ion-electron mass ratio and the numerical speed of light on the growth rate of the most unstable modes is minimal. This suggests that the fully kinetic method offers a potential for reduced computational cost when investigating the physics of drift wave instabilities at relevant space-time scales.</description>

      <title>Robust Extraction of Electron Energy Probability Function via Neural Network-Based Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the electron energy probability function (EEPF) is vital for understanding electron kinetics and energy distributions in plasmas. However, interpreting Langmuir probe current-voltage (I-V) characteristics is often hindered by nonlinear sheath dynamics, plasma instabilities, and diagnostic noise. These factors introduce fluctuations and distortions, making second derivative calculations highly sensitive and error-prone. Traditional smoothing methods, such as the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter and AC modulation techniques, rely on local data correlations and struggle to differentiate between noise and meaningful plasma behavior. In this study, we present a neural network-based machine learning approach for robust EEPF extraction, specifically designed to address the challenges posed by non-Maxwellian electron energy distributions. A multi-layer perceptron combined with ensemble averaging captures the global structure of the I-V characteristics, enabling adaptive and consistent smoothing without compromising physical fidelity. Compared to conventional SG filtering, the proposed method achieves superior smoothing of the second derivative, resulting in more stable and accurate EEPF reconstruction across the entire electron energy range. This capability confers a strong diagnostic advantage in beam-driven, low-pressure, or other non-equilibrium plasma conditions, where accurate characterization of non-Maxwellian EEPFs is essential.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity surrogate model for the ion temperature gradient (ITG) instability using a small expensive simulation dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in building high-fidelity surrogate models of tokamak turbulence is the substantial demand for high-quality data. Typically, producing high-quality data involves simulating complex physical processes, which requires extensive computing resources. In this work, we propose a fine tuning-based approach to develop the surrogate model that reduces the amount of high-quality data required by 80\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by constructing a proof-of-principle ITG surrogate model using datasets generated from two gyrokinetic codes, GKW and GX. GX needs in terms of computing resources are much lighter than GKW. Remarkably, the surrogate models' performance remain nearly the same whether trained on 798 GKW results alone or 159 GKW results plus an additional 11979 GX results. These encouraging outcomes indicate that fine tuning methods can significantly decrease the high-quality data needed to develop the simulation-driven surrogate model. Moreover, the approach presented here has the potential to facilitate surrogate model development for heavy codes and may ultimately pave the way for digital twin systems of tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Tearing Mode Stability Near Ideal Stability Boundaries Via Asymptotic Matching Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of improvements to the TJ toroidal tearing mode code [Phys. Plasmas 31, 102507 (2024)] are documented. The TJ code is also successfully benchmarked against the STRIDE toroidal tearing mode code [Phys. Plasmas 25, 082502 (2018)]. Finally, the new capabilities of the TJ code are used to investigate the stability of tearing modes in tokamak plasmas as an ideal stability boundary, associated with either an external-kink or an internal-kink mode, is approached. All elements of the tearing stability matrix are found to tend to infinity as an ideal stability boundary is approached. Furthermore, as the stability boundary is approached, the eigenfunctions of the various tearing modes in the plasma, which are decoupled by sheared plasma rotation, are all found to morph into that of the marginally-stable ideal mode. However, the growth-rates and real frequencies of the various ``ideal-tearing-modes'' are different from one another. Moreover, the growth-rate of the ideal-tearing-mode that reconnects magnetic flux at the rational surface that lies closest to the edge of the plasma is the one that tends to a very large value as the stability boundary is approached. A relatively simple test for ideal stability that is capable of detecting stability boundaries for external-kink and internal-kink modes, even in the presence of a very close-fitting ideal wall, is described and verified.</description>

      <title>Distinct parallel electrostatic collisionless shocks in hot-cold ablative mixing plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot-cold ablative mixing plasmas are ubiquitous in astrophysical and laboratory systems, where a cold/dense plasma is roughly in pressure balance with a hot/dilute plasma. Examples include the plasma thermal quench during major disruptions in tokamaks, interaction between a central hot-spot and the solid liner in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsule, and the formation of large-scale structures in galaxy clusters. In such systems, a parallel electrostatic collisionless shock forms and plays a critical role in both the thermal collapse of the hot plasma and the ablative mixing of cold ions. The formation and dynamics of such shocks are investigated by employing one-dimensional VPIC simulations and theoretical analyses, revealing key differences from the well-studied collisionless shocks where an over-pressured, high-density plasma expands into a rarefied background. Notably, the shock formation has a weak dependence on the plasma pressure, provided that the density ratio between the cold and hot plasmas is large. Instead, the shock is primarily governed by the plasma temperatures on both sides. The collisionless electron thermal conduction flux in both upstream and downstream regions follows the free-streaming limit itself, but its spatial gradient exhibits convective scaling, ensuring the same characteristic length scale of the electron temperature and density evolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the multiphase interstellar medium of the Milky Way: turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy density relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are an important component of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. The thermal gas in the ISM has a multiphase structure, broadly divided into ionised, atomic, and molecular phases. The connection between the multiphase ISM gas and magnetic field is not known and this makes it difficult to account for their impact on star formation and galaxy evolution. Usually, in star formation studies, a relationship between the gas density, $n$ and magnetic field strength, $B$, is assumed to study magnetic fields' impact. However, this requires the knowledge of the geometry of star-forming regions and ambient magnetic field orientation. Here, we use the Zeeman magnetic field measurements from the literature for the atomic and molecular ISM and supplement the magnetic field estimates in the ionised ISM using pulsar observations to find a relation between the turbulent kinetic, $E_{\rm kin}$, and magnetic, $E_{\rm mag}$, energy densities. Across all three phases and over a large range of densities ($10^{-3}\,{\rm cm}^{-3} \lesssim n \lesssim 10^{7}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$), we find $E_{\rm mag} \propto E_{\rm kin}$. Furthermore, we use phase-wise probability density functions of density, magnetic fields, and turbulent velocities to show that the magnetic field fluctuations are controlled by both density and turbulent velocity fluctuations. This work demonstrates that a combination of both the density and turbulent velocity determines magnetic fields in the ISM.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics and Blow Up in a Model of Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study a one dimensional model for Magnetic Relaxation. This model was introduced by Moffatt and describes a low resistivity viscous plasma, in which the pressure and the inercia are much smaller than the magnetic pressure. In the limit of resistivity $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, we prove the existence of two time scales for the evolution of the magnetic field: a fast one for times of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which the resistivity plays no role and the energy is dissipated only via viscosity; and a slow one for times of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$ characterized by the influence of the resistivity. We show that in this second time scale, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on time. We also prove that, in this regime, the magnetic field $b_\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ by the solution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven construction of a generalized kinetic collision operator from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Walk Inspired Qubit Lattice Algorithm for Simulating Electromagnetic Wave Propagation and Scattering in Conservative and Dissipative Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Dirac representation of Maxwell equations we present an explicit, discrete space-time, quantum walk-inspired algorithm suitable for simulating the electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering from inhomogeneities within magnetized plasmas. The quantum walk is implemented on a lattice with an internal space of $n_q=4$--qubits, used to encode the classical field amplitudes. Unitary rotation gates operate within this internal space to generate the non-trivial dynamics of the free plasma-Dirac equation. To incorporate the contributions from the cyclotron and plasma density terms--manifesting as inhomogeneous potential terms--in the plasma-Dirac equation, the walk process is complemented with unitary potential operators. This leads to a unitary qubit lattice sequence that recovers the plasma-Dirac equation under a second-order accurate discretization scheme. The proposed algorithm is explicit and demonstrates, in the worst case, a polynomial quantum advantage compared to the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) classical method in terms of resource requirements and error complexity. In addition, we extend the algorithm to include dissipative effects by introducing a phenomenological collision frequency between plasma species. Then, a post-selective time-marching implementation scheme is delineated, featuring a non-vanishing overall success probability and, subsequently, eliminating the need for amplitude amplification of the output state while preserving the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS typically wraps around the sub-stellar companion, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a marginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in J2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to estimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\rm IBS} \sim 40-100$ G and place lower bounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the magnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Particle-In-Cell simulations of the filamentation process in magnetized radio-frequency plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a uniform radio-frequency (RF) plasma between a large electrode pair, the addition of an axial magnetic field induces diverse longitudinal filaments. To reveal its pattern dynamics, we conduct two-dimensional (2D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, capturing the entire evolution of the filamentation process. We found that the entire evolution experiences two dynamic stages. In the first stage, electrostatic standing waves and plasma density ripples grow synergistically, forming filamentary pattern. Our results show that the plasma ripples and RF electrostatic standing waves are modulated. In addition, each filament equips a double-humped peak. The spectrum reveals that the oscillations are mainly RF and its higher harmonics. Subsequently, the plasma shifts towards a dynamic regime governed by the competition between Lorentz and thermal pressure forces, characterized by the chaotic evolution of filaments. Through RF-cycle averaging, our force analysis demonstrated that electrons and ions are governed by the magnetic force and electric force respectively. The time-averaged magnetic force drives electrons to accumulate at plasma density maxima, while time-averaged electric force pushes ions into the same regions, jointly molding the filaments. These novel clues pave the way for a theoretical understanding of filamentation instability and provide essential references for effectively manipulating magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Energy Spectrum of Lost Alpha Particles in Magnetic Mirror Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a magnetic mirror fusion reactor, capturing the energy of fusion-produced alpha particles is essential to sustaining the reaction. However, since alpha particles are born at energies much higher than the confining potential, a substantial fraction are lost due to pitch-angle scattering before they can transfer their energy to the plasma via drag. The energy of lost alpha particles can still be captured through direct conversion, but designing an effective mechanism requires a description of the energies and times at which they become deconfined. Here we present analytical solutions for the loss velocity, energy, and time distributions of alpha particles in a magnetic mirror. After obtaining the Fokker-Planck collision operator, we asymptotically solve for the eigenfunctions of the Legendre operator to reveal a closed-form solution. Our framework applies to any high-energy species, for any applied potential and mirror ratio R &gt; 1, making this work broadly applicable to mirror devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confinement of plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators depends on magnetic field lines lying in nested toroidal surfaces. The transition near the plasma edge away from the lines lying in magnetic surfaces defines properties of divertors. The transition in time defines properties of disruptions. Divertor design and disruption analyses require a detailed understanding of these transitions. The use of a Fourier transform coupled with a Gaussian window function allows far more information to be extracted about these transitions using far shorter field line integrations than can be obtained using traditional methods based on Poincar\'e plots. The physics of divertors and disruptions is reviewed to clarify why the type of information that can be gained from more efficient methods of analysis is of central importance to the fusion program based on magnetic confinement.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

We show that a fully spin-polarized single flavor up-quark gas could generate a cosmic magnetic fields in excess of $10^{15}$ Tesla, far in excess of a possible upper limit to the primordial field. The complete multi component ferro-magnetized primordial fermion gas we consider consists of (five) nearly free electrically charged quarks, and leptons (electrons, muons, tau). We present details of how the magnetization is obtained using a grand partition function approach and point to the role of the nonrelativistic particle component. In the range of temperature 150 MeV to 500 MeV our results are also of interest to laboratory QGP experiments. We show that the required polarization capable to explain large scale structure magnetic fields observed has $1/T$ scaling in the limit of high $T$, and could be very small, at pico-scale. In the other limit, as temperature decreases in the expanding Universe, we show that any magnetic fields present before hadronization can be carried forward to below quark confinement condition temperature by polarization of electrons and muons.</description>
