      <title>On the prime ends extension of unclosed inverse mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mappings that distort the modulus of families of paths in the opposite direction in the manner of Poletsky's inequality. Here we study the case when the mappings are not closed, in particular, they do not preserve the boundary of the domain under the mapping. Under certain conditions, we obtain results on the continuous boundary extension of such mappings in the sense of prime ends. In addition, we obtain corresponding results on the equicontinuity of families of such mappings in terms of prime ends.</description>

      <title>$SLE_6$ and 2-d critical bond percolation on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Shift invariant subspaces of large index in the Bloch space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the shift operator $M_z$, defined on the Bloch space and the little Bloch space and we study the corresponding lattice of invariant subspaces. The index of a closed invariant subspace $E$ is defined as $\text{ind}(E) = \dim(E/M_z E)$. We construct closed, shift invariant subspaces in the Bloch space that can have index as large as the cardinality of the unit interval $[0,1]$. Next we focus on the little Bloch space, providing a construction of closed, shift invariant subspaces that have arbitrary large index. Finally we establish several results on the index for the weak-star topology of a Banach space and prove a stability theorem for the index when passing from (norm closed) invariant subspaces of a Banach space to their weak-star closure in its second dual. This is then applied to prove the existence of weak-star closed invariant subspaces of arbitrary index in the Bloch space.</description>

      <title>Non-smooth paths having unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the question of whether a non-constant absolutely continuous path can be reparametrised as being unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric. Even when the answer is "Yes," which isn't always the case, its proof involves some subtleties. We answer the above question and discuss a small application to Kobayashi geometry.</description>

      <title>Polynomial correspondences expressible as maps of $d$-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider polynomial correspondences $f (x, y)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x, y]$ of degree $d \ge 2$ in both the variables and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the equation $f (x, y) = 0$ can be expressed as $\phi (x) = \psi (y)$, where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are fractional degree $d$ rational maps in the Riemann sphere. In the absence of involutions that played a vital role towards characterising quadratic correspondences ($d = 2$), we employ certain elementary ideas from theory of equations and matrices to achieve our results. We further explore certain symmetry conditions on the matrix of coefficients of correspondences that satisfy the above factorisation. We conclude this short note with a few examples.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic motions, natural families of entire maps, and multiplier-like objects for wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural stability of holomorphic functions has been the subject of much research in the last fifty years. Due to various technicalities, however, most of that work has focused on so-called finite-type functions (functions whose set of singular values has finite cardinality). Recent developments in the field go beyond this setting. In this paper we extend Eremenko and Lyubich's result on natural families of entire maps to the case where the set of singular values is not the entire complex plane, showing under this assumption that the set $M_f$ of entire functions quasiconformally equivalent to $f$ admits the structure of a complex manifold (of possibly infinite dimension). Moreover, we will consider functions with wandering domains -- another hot topic of research in complex dynamics. Given an entire function $f$ with a simply connected wandering domain $U$, we construct an analogue of the multiplier of a periodic orbit, called a distortion sequence, and show that, under some hypotheses, the distortion sequence moves analytically as $f$ moves within appropriate parameter families.</description>

      <title>Massless field equations for spin 3/2 in dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Main topic of the paper is a study of properties of massless fields of spin 3/2 in its Euclidean version. A lot of information is available already for massless fields in dimension 4. Here, we concentrate on dimension 6 and we are using the fact that the group SL(4,C) is isomorphic with the group Spin(6,C). It makes it possible to use tensor formalism for massless fields. Main problems treated in the paper are a description of fields which need to be considered in the spin 3/2 case, a suitable choice of equations they should satisfy, irreducibility of homogeneous solutions of massless field equations, the Fischer decomposition and the Howe duality for such fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a twisted version of the Kawamata semi-positivity theorem by the $\mathbb{Q}$-line bundle with a vanishing Lelong number at every point. Moreover, we apply the result for the finite generation problem of canonical rings for Birkar's generalized pairs.</description>
