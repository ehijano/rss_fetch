      <title>Nucleation suppression by charge screening on grain boundaries: a kinetic model for bulk imprint in polycrystalline ferroelectric thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imprint effect, a significant reliability challenge in ferroelectric memories, manifests as a shift in the coercive field during retention and endurance tests, ultimately degrading the usable memory window. \rv{While traditional models attribute imprint primarily to charge screening at the interface between the dead layer and the ferroelectric film, the contribution from grain boundaries has been largely overlooked. This work advances a bulk imprint mechanism by establishing a phase-field model, which demonstrates that the tuning of domain nuclei near grain boundaries via charge screening consistently explains the imprint process and aligns with key experimental trends.} These findings provide novel insights into the imprint process and advance the understanding of reliability issues in ferroelectric memory devices.</description>

      <title>Reproducible container solutions for codes and workflows in materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computing solution combining the GNU Guix functional package manager with the Apptainer container system is presented. This approach provides fully declarative and reproducible software environments suitable for computational materials science. Its versatility and performance enable the construction of complete frameworks integrating workflow managers such as AiiDA, and Ewoks that can be deployed on HPC infrastructures. The efficiency of the solution is illustrated through several examples: (i) AiiDA workflows for automated dataset construction and analysis as well as path-integral molecular dynamics based on ab initio calculations; (ii) workflows for the training of machine-learning interatomic potentials; and (iii) an Ewoks workflow for the automated analysis of coherent X-ray diffraction data in large-scale synchrotron facilities. These examples demonstrate that the proposed environment provides a reliable and reproducible basis for computational and data-driven research in materials science.</description>

      <title>CrSe_2 and CrTe_2 Monolayers as Efficient Air Pollutants Nanosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosensors are critical in environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and public health by detecting specific hazardous gases like CO, NO, SO_2, and CH_4 at trace levels. This study uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the gas-sensing capabilities of chromium diselenide (CrSe_2) and chromium ditelluride (CrTe_2) monolayers through their structural and electronic responses to gas adsorption. Adsorption energy analysis shows that Te vacancy-induced CrTe_2 (VTe-CrTe_2) exhibits the strongest binding with energies of -1.52, -1.79, and -1.61 eV for CO, NO, and SO_2, respectively. Similarly, CrSe_2 has its values of -1.13, -1.17, -0.90, and -1.12 eV for CO, NO, SO_2, and CH_2, respectively, indicating suitability for reversible sensing. This study also investigates how substitutional doping of Ge, Sb, and Sn influences the sensing mechanism of CrSe_2 and CrTe_2 monolayers. Density of states (DOS) analysis highlights notable electronic changes around the Fermi level, especially in VTe-CrTe_2 and Sb/Sn-doped CrTe_2, confirming their enhanced sensing abilities. Charge density difference analysis shows significant charge redistribution, with CrTe_2 experiencing stronger charge transfer effects than CrSe_2. Variations in electrostatic potential and work function further demonstrate the higher sensitivity of CrTe_2, particularly in its defective and doped forms, confirming its status as a superior material for gas sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Vanishing quantum confinement enables bright and thermally excited multi-carrier emission from semiconductor nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, nanocrystals in the regime of vanishing quantum confinement-termed bulk nanocrystals (BNCs)-have demonstrated remarkable optical gain characteristics. While their high-power lasing performance was demonstrated convincingly, the photophysics at low and intermediate powers-where charge-carrier populations are discrete-remain unexplored. Using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array technology, we resolve the dynamics and energetics of six multi-carrier excited states in individual CdSe/CdS core/shell BNCs, containing up to four electrons and two holes. Each state exhibits bimodal emission, indicative of thermal equilibrium between closely spaced electron and hole levels, confirmed via temperature-dependent single-particle measurements. Quantification of radiative and nonradiative decay channels reveals strongly suppressed Auger recombination through both the negative- and positive-trion pathways. We present a model that combines statistical scaling of rate constants with Fermi-Dirac thermal occupations of electron and hole levels, bridging the transitional regime between quantum-confined and bulk nanocrystals, and providing a comprehensive framework for understanding this emerging class of materials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Predicting Magnetization from X-ray Diffraction of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Using Simple Physics-Based Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation and high-throughput characterization and synthesis for material development are becoming increasingly common; these approaches require machine learning (ML) tools to assess material properties, ideally based on a single measurement. Here, ML models are developed to predict magnetization from X-ray diffraction (XRD) for iron oxide nanoparticles. Our approach is to first develop a set of simulated data that links modulated XRD, based on a crystallographic information file (CIF), to a simple magnetic model to determine magnetization at a given magnetic field, thereby enabling us to train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models on a large amount of simulated data. The models are validated by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and measuring their crystal structure via XRD and room-temperature magnetization curves. In doing so, we can fine-tune both the training hyperparameters and the optimal size of the simulated datasets used to train the models. Through this optimization, the best models can achieve an $R^2$ greater than 0.9 for five experimental samples, used for tuning, for predicting the max magnetization (at 2.8 T) of the measurement. Lastly, we demonstrate reasonable predictions on the full magnetization vs. magnetic field curve, showing that the RF model excels at predicting the high magnetic field values, which is key for determining the success of an iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis for applications like magnetic particle imaging (MPI), thermal magnetic particle imaging (T-MPI), and hyperthermia.</description>

      <title>Carbon Capture from wet vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present molecular dynamics simulations of the adsorption of mixed CO2-water vapors on a graphene flakes substrate, a model inspired by the microporous structure of activated carbons. Adsorption strength is quantified through a reduced energy measure that avoids ambiguities associated with defining adsorption regions. We find that CO2 adsorbs more strongly and more rapidly than water across all temperatures studied. Adsorption from wet vapors was observed to result in higher CO2 uptake compared with dry vapors at temperatures below 375 K. At intermediate temperatures, water molecules were seen to form clusters that interact with both the substrate and CO2, potentially promoting CO2 adsorption. Additionally, we observe that the GF substrate inhibits the formation of large water clusters, altering water aggregation dynamics near the surface. These findings highlight a cooperative adsorption mechanism in humid environments and suggest that graphene-flakes-based materials may perform effectively for carbon capture under realistic, moisture-containing conditions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-agent Large Language Model Reasoning for Autonomous Functional Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific exploration, but most methods automate procedural tasks without engaging in scientific reasoning, limiting autonomy in discovery. We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Fully Compensated Ferrimagnetic Properties of (Cr,Fe)S Compound with a Pyrrhotite-type Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To optimize the processing conditions for the (Cr,Fe)S non-equilibrium phase with a pyrrhotite-type structure, the phase states and magnetic properties of the specimens obtained at various sintering temperatures were investigated. A slightly off-stoichiometric composition of Cr23Fe23S54 (approximately (Cr,Fe)7S8) sintered and quenched from 1323 K indicates a single-phase pyrrhotite-type structure with a layered-NiAs-type structure in which vacancies occupy every two layers (C12/c1; the space number is 15). The compound shows fully compensated ferrimagnetic behavior at a magnetization compensated temperature of approximately 200 K. The magnetic behavior exhibits a typical N-type ferrimagnet, as predicted by N\'eel. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, it is found that the compound is composed of Fe2+ and Cr3+. The large magnetic coercivity of 38 kOe at 5 K is also unique and can be applied to spintronic devices. Furthermore, changing the quenching temperature enables control of the degree of order of the vacancies in the interlayer and results in tuning of the magnetization compensated temperature. First-principles calculations show a pseudo-gap located at the Fermi level in the up-spin band, suggesting high spin polarization as well as the NiAs-type structure indicated in the previous our report.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermal and acoustic response of an elastically anisotropic solid to a nanosecond laser pulse in transient grating spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is a material characterization technique based on laser-induced thermoelastic excitation of thermal and acoustic gratings. On opaque samples, these gratings are dynamic surface displacements that reflect the sample's elastic and thermal properties, enabling both types of parameters to be determined from a single experiment. Here, we develop a detailed finite element model (FEM) simulation of the TGS experiment that fully captures the coupling between the thermal and mechanical fields, as well as the optical detection of surface displacement using a heterodyning approach. Using custom-designed two-dimensional elements, the model is particularly suitable for analyzing TGS measurements on anisotropic media, for which analytical theory is insufficient. The simulation captures not only the anisotropic relaxation of the thermoelastic field but also several acoustic features that arise at very short (ultra-transient) timescales and provide additional information about the elastic properties of the examined material. The model offers new opportunities for the in silico testing of various modifications of TGS experiments and their applications to a broad class of materials.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Rate Performance of Potassium-Ion Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries dominate battery research and industry due to their long research history and high energy density. However, increasing demand and limited lithium resources have raised lithium prices and battery costs, motivating interest in alternative chemistries. Potassium-ion batteries have recently attracted attention because potassium is more abundant and potentially lower cost, although the technology remains at an early stage and requires further insight for development. In this work, recently developed methods for rigorous analysis of electrode rate performance are applied to published rate-performance data from a wide range of potassium-ion batteries. Using specific capacity (mAh per g) versus charge and discharge rate curves, performance parameters are extracted to evaluate the applicability of the key model underlying these methods and to analyze opportunities for potassium-ion batteries. Relationships between these parameters and electrode properties are used to interpret performance trends and compare potassium-ion batteries with established technologies. The analysis shows that the model effectively fits potassium-ion battery rate-performance data and allows reliable extraction of performance parameters. While potassium-ion batteries generally exhibit lower specific capacities than lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, their upper limit of rate performance is found to exceed that of lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and related two-dimensional material electrodes, despite the larger atomic size and mass of potassium.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Dirac fermion and anomalous oscillator strength of zeroth Landau level transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac fermions, characterized by their linear dispersion and relativistic nature, have emerged as a prominent class of quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. While the Dirac equation, initially developed in the context of high-energy physics, provides a remarkable framework for describing the electronic properties of these materials, the inherent symmetry constraints of condensed matter often lead to deviations from the idealized paradigm. In particular, three-dimensional Dirac fermions in solids often exhibit anisotropic behavior, challenging the notion of perfect symmetry inherent in the Dirac equation. Here, we report the observation of isotropic massive Dirac fermions in LaAlSi through Landau level spectroscopy. The presence of three-dimensional massive Dirac fermions across the Fermi energy is demonstrated by quantized and semiclassical analyses of the magnetic field evolution of Landau level transitions. The isotropic topological nature, Fermi velocity, and Dirac mass are evidenced by the identical magneto-infrared response among the Faraday and three Voigt geometries. Furthermore, we observe an unusually large oscillator strength in the zeroth Landau level transition of the Dirac fermion, compared to transitions with higher indices. This phenomenon, supported by model calculations, can be attributed to the combined effects of the partial excitation of Dirac fermion and the resonant dielectric coupling with the Weyl plasma. Our work provides a strategy for realizing ideal quasiparticle excitations and their coupling effects in condensed matter systems, offering a platform for exploring relativistic physics.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reaction Rate Constants from Impedance Spectra: Simulating the Multistep Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics is reshaping our understanding of quantum systems by revealing states and phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. While non-Hermiticity is typically associated with gain-loss processes in open systems, we uncover a fundamentally different route to non-Hermitian behavior emerging from non-equilibrium correlations. In photoexcited semiconductors, the effective interaction between electrons and holes gives rise to a pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian (PH-BSH) that governs excitonic states in the presence of excited populations. Within this framework, we identify a previously unknown class of excitonic quasiparticles - exceptional excitons - corresponding to exceptional points embedded inside the electron-hole continuum. Exceptional excitons emerge at the onset of population inversion, and represent the strongly renormalized counterparts of the system's equilibrium excitons. They are spatially localized, protected against hybridization with the continuum, and remain long-lived even in regimes where conventional excitons undergo a Mott transition. Crucially, exceptional excitons appear only when the PH-BSH is evaluated with non-thermal, resonantly generated carrier populations that support an excitonic superfluid. Ab initio results for monolayer WS_2 explicitly demonstrate this scenario and show that exceptional excitons can be realized with existing ultrafast pumping techniques. We also identify distinctive optical and photoemission signatures that enable their unambiguous detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimensions, and provides a basis for studying temperature-dependent electronic instabilities (e.g., charge-density waves) within density-functional theory and DFPT.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift in scattering from topological nodal-ring semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron beam may experience an anomalous spatial shift during an interface scattering process. Here, we investigate this phenomenon for reflection from mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-ring semimetals, which are characterized by an integer topological charge $\chi_h$. We show that the shift is generally enhanced by the presence of nodal rings, and the ring's geometry can be inferred from the profile of shift vectors in the interface momentum plane. Importantly, the anomalous shift encodes the topological information of the ring, where the circulation of the shift vector field $\kappa_s$ over a semicircle is governed by the topological charge, with a simple relationship: $\kappa_s=-2\pi \chi_h$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shift and its circulation reflect distinct features of topological phase transitions of the charged rings. This study uncovers a novel physical signature of topological nodal rings and positions anomalous scattering shifts as a powerful tool for probing topological band structures.</description>

      <title>Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in its excited state is studied by first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT). The activation pathways of the JT distortions are analyzed to elucidate and quantify the contribution of different vibrational modes. The results show that the dominant vibrational modes in the JT distortions are closely related to the phonon sideband observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), consistent with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation results. Our calculations provide a new way to understand the origin and the mechanism of the vibronic coupling of the system. The obtained dominant vibrational modes coupled to the NV centre and their interactions with electronic states provides new insights into dephasing, relaxation and optically driven quantum effects, and are critical for the application to quantum information, magnetometry and sensing.</description>

      <title>Accurate bandgaps of photovoltaic kesterites from first-principles DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamlined prediction of the electronic properties of photoactive materials warrants a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that (i) yields reliable bandgaps, (ii) is free of empirically tuned parameters, and (iii) exhibits low computational overhead. Here we show that for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 kesterite photovoltaic materials, all three of these demands are met by the DFT plus Hubbard U technique (DFT+U) with corrective parameters evaluated via minimum-tracking linear response. The predicted bandgaps are found to even marginally outperform those from the self-consistent GW approach. Key to this method's success is the application of Hubbard U corrections to all atomic subspaces that dominate the conduction and valence band edges, as opposed to the conventional approach of correcting 3d and 4f atomic states. Intriguingly, the inclusion of Hund's J corrections via the extended DFT+U+J functional significantly worsens these results. This under performance can be ameliorated through the use of the Burgess-Linscott-O'Regan (BLOR) flat-plane based Hubbard U plus Hund's J functional, with bandgap predictions in close agreement with the conventional DFT+U method. The DFT+U method is also used to predict defect-induced changes to the bandgap and associated formation energies, in 1,728-atom supercells.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetic Order in Tetragonal Antiperovskite Mn$_3$GeN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal and magnetic structures of the nitride antiperovskite Mn$_3$GeN reveals ferrimagnetic order stemming from a distorted kagome-derived lattice of the Mn atoms. Polycrystalline Mn$_3$GeN was synthesized via a solid-state reaction and characterized using neutron powder diffraction, DC magnetometry, and first-principles calculations. Rietveld refinement reveals near-stoichiometric composition (Mn$_3$GeN$_{0.94(1)}$) adopting a tetragonal $I4/mcm$ structure at $T$ = 500 K and below, featuring axially distorted and tilted [NMn$_6$] octahedra that result in a buckled Mn kagome lattice. On heating, the tetragonal distortion and octahedral tilt angle decrease continuously before transitioning to the cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ antiperovskite phase at $T \approx$ 524 K. Neutron diffraction and magnetometry together reveal noncollinear ferrimagnetic ordering. For 30 K $\le T \le$ 500 K, the magnetic structure is described by a single propagation vector, $k$ = (0, 0, 0), with inequivalent Mn1 and Mn2 sublattices that couple antiferromagnetically to yield a net moment. Density functional theory-based calculations show the different local moments originate from the bandwidths associated with the distinct Mn-N bond lengths. The temperature dependence of the sublattice moments indicates a compensation-like crossover between Mn1- and Mn2-derived magnetization near 380 K. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized subtlety in the magnetic and structural behavior of Mn$_3$GeN, highlighting the interplay between structural distortions, magnetic ordering, and electronic structure in kagome-derived antiperovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Structure, Bonding and Stability of Boron Substituted Tungsten Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate effects of boron substitution on the structural and electronic properties of small tungsten clusters using density functional theory (DFT). We construct a series of tungsten boride clusters by replacing tungsten atoms with boron atoms to analyze their stability and other properties. Boron substitution in Wn clusters results in significant geometric distortions shortening the bond lengths and thereby reducing the clusters overall symmetry. The boron atoms prefers to occupy apex or edge positions. Its lower atomic radius and stronger electronegativity are the driving forces behind these structural changes.The binding energy per atom, HOMO LUMO gap, and chemical hardness increase with boron incorporation, indicating enhanced electronic stability.Additionally, negative chemical potentials are observed, which confirm greater charge localization and lower reactivity.BB stretches at high frequencies suggest strong boron-boron bonds with localized electrons, consistent with negative chemical potentials that promote charge retention over delocalization. WB modes in mid frequencies reflect metal boron interactions stabilizing the cluster, reducing overall reactivity as seen in prior Fukui analyses of electron density.Fukui functions pinpoint nucleophilic or electrophilic sites on W-B clusters, corroborating low reactivity from localized charges negative potentials confirm electrons are tightly bound, limiting site accessibility for reactions.</description>

      <title>Chemical Engineering of Altermagnetism in Two-Dimensional Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a novel class of collinear antiferromagnetism exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting without net magnetization, driven by lattice symmetry rather than spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we introduce a coordination-driven chemical strategy to realize altermagnetic (AM) spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) planar tetracoordinated Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that replacing centrosymmetric pyrazine (pyz) ligands with non-centrosymmetric imidazole (imz) linkers in Cr-based MOFs reduces lattice symmetry, enabling g-wave AM spin splitting up to 65 meV. Furthermore, frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) allows selective ligand spin polarization, inducing a shift to d-wave AM anisotropy in polycyclic ligand-based 2D MOFs with spin splitting up to 83.9 meV. Microscopic magnetic exchange interactions (J) analysis reveals that ligand-mediated interactions dominate over metal-metal coupling, stabilizing AM order in systems with radical ligands. Interestingly, we further confirm AM spin splitting in spin wave spectrum, where chiral magnon splitting is observed. Finally, we show that AM spin splitting gives rise to experimentally accessible charge to spin conversion, emerging as a linear response in d-wave and as a symmetry-allowed nonlinear effect in g-wave 2D AM MOFs. This work establishes coordination chemistry as a powerful and versatile route to symmetry control in 2D MOFs, enabling rational design of 2D molecular materials with tunable electronic and AM properties for next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Size-strain characteristics of lead and gold under fast ramp compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in materials under fast ramp compression are an ongoing research topic, which is part of several global projects like inertial fusion. Currently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination of samples under fast ramp compression is limited to the determination of the sample phase state and the unit cell lattice parameters. Here, we propose to extend this examination route by introducing the Williamson-Hall analysis of the XRD data measured in samples under fast ramp rate conditions. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we performed an analysis for ramp compressed lead $(P = 200 GPa)$ and gold $(P = 1003 GPa)$, which both exhibit a transition from the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice to the body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice at the studied pressures. The analysis showed that lead under fast ramp compression has a nanocrystalline structure with a crystalline size of $D = (4 \pm 1) nm$ and lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.006 \pm 0.002 $. The effect of extreme hardening of bcc-Pb under fast ramp compression can be explained as the formation of an ultrafine grain structure in this metal. Elemental gold exhibits average crystalline size $D &gt; 12 nm $ and unprecedentedly high, for a pure metallic element, lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.014 \pm 0.001 $ under fast ramp compression.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the unusual strain morphologies and polar Moir\'e patterns in twisted ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory calculations are conducted to understand and reveal the origin of the complex shear strain morphology and of the polar Moir\'e topological pattern recently observed in twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayers. Our first-principles calculations, along with an original analysis of them allowing the decomposition of forces into the acoustic and optical contributions, point out to the occurrence of forces mostly acting on the {\it acoustic-related} motions to produce the standing waves of the shear strain. Such acoustic waves naturally generate a striking self-organization of the shear strains, and hence create a peculiar gradient of these shear strains. A Moir\'e dipole pattern, consisting of the interpenetrated arrays of vortices and antivortices made of the electric dipoles, then mostly arises due to the coupling of this gradient of the shear strain with the electric dipoles. Furthermore, other forces, namely acting on the motions associated with the {\it optical phonons}, could also play a role in the formation of these polar vortices and antivortices, but at a smaller extent.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification of Thermal Transport Measurements through Bayesian Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal transport community is increasingly interested in rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of their measurements. In this work, we argue that Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) represents a powerful framework for both analysis/fitting and UQ. We provide a detailed walkthrough of the technique (including code to duplicate our results) and example analysis based on measuring the thermal conductance of a gold/sapphire interface with FDTR. Comparisons are made against traditional analysis/UQ techniques adopted by the thermal transport community. Notable advantages of BPE include the interpretability of its results, including the capacity to indicate incorrect input assumptions, as well as a way to balance overall goodness of fit against prior knowledge of feasible parameter values. In some cases, incorporating this additional information can affect not only the magnitude of error bars but the inferred values themselves.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Predictions of Process-Induced Deformation in Carbon/Epoxy Composites Using a Deep Operator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced hole delocalization in the strongly correlated quasicubic charge-transfer perovskite $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+\delta}$d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+\delta}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Sensor free, self regulating thermal switching via anomalous Ettingshausen effect and spin reorientation in DyCo5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a sensor free, self regulating thermal switch that combines the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE) with a temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in the rare earth cobalt compound DyCo$_5$. Using density functional theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)$ and the finite temperature anomalous Nernst conductivity $\alpha_{xy}(T)$ for two magnetization directions, magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. While the intrinsic $\sigma_{xy}$ at the Fermi level remains sizable for both orientations, $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits an about two orders of magnitude contrast in the SRT temperature window. This contrast is consistent with the low temperature Mott relation through the energy slope $\partial_\varepsilon \sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)\rvert_{E_{\mathrm F}}$ and is traced to strongly peaked Berry curvature hot spots generated by spin orbit coupling induced avoided crossings of Co $3d$ bands. Combining $\alpha_{xy}$ with longitudinal transport coefficients, we estimate device level metrics, namely the anomalous Nernst thermopower $S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$ and the Ettingshausen coefficient $\Pi_{\mathrm{AEE}}=T S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$, and demonstrate robust orientation controlled switching under a fixed in plane bias current. These results establish a materials based route to compact thermal control without external sensors or feedback electronics and provide a concrete example that the proposed principle can be realized in an existing ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable spin qubits in strain-engineered graphene p-n junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On the Boroxol Ring Fraction in Melt-Quenched B$_2$O$_3$ Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An atomistic structural model for melt-quenched B$_2$O$_3$ glass has eluded the simulation community so far. The difficulty lies in the abundance of the six-membered boroxol rings - an intermediate-range order motif suggested through Raman and NMR spectroscopy - which is challenging to obtain in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the development of a DFT-accurate machine-learned potential for B$_2$O$_3$ and employ quench rates as low as 10$^{9}$ K/s to obtain B$_2$O$_3$ glasses with more than 30% of boron atoms in boroxol rings. Also, we show that the pressure, and consequently the boroxol fraction, in the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations critically depends on the range of the geometry descriptor used in the embedding neural network, and at least a 9 $\unicode{x212B}$ range is required. The boroxol ring fraction increases with decreasing quench rate. Finally, amorphous B$_2$O$_3$ configurations display a minimum in energy at a boroxol fraction of 75%, intriguingly close to the experimental estimate in B$_2$O$_3$ glass.</description>

      <title>Detection of Image Potential States above the vacuum level in GeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric semiconductor {\alpha}-GeTe(111) has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to its unique properties, with extensive studies focusing on its occupied electronic bandstructure. In contrast, its unoccupied states - particularly those near the conduction band minimum - remain largely unexplored. In an effort to characterize those states, we surprisingly observe three image potential states (IPS) in {\alpha}-GeTe(111) extending up to 0.8 eV above the vacuum level. Using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve the full parabolic dispersions of the first three IPS and determine their binding energies. Our analysis, combined with Bloch spectral function calculations, reveals that the unexpected persistence of IPS above the vacuum level originates from strong dipole transitions and the presence of large electron reservoirs in GeTe.</description>

      <title>Theory of thermomagnonic torques in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Fast Interlayer Energy Transfer from the Lower Bandgap MoS2 to the Higher Bandgap WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report an ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing us to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</description>

      <title>Database and deep-learning scalability of anharmonic phonon properties by automated brute-force first-principles calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the anharmonic phonon properties of crystal compounds -- such as phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivities -- is essential for investigating and optimizing their thermal transport behaviors. These properties also impact optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics through interactions between phonons and other quasiparticles and fields. In this study, we develop an automated first-principles workflow to calculate anharmonic phonon properties and build a comprehensive database encompassing more than 6,000 inorganic compounds. Utilizing this dataset, we train a graph neural network model to predict thermal conductivity values and spectra from structural parameters, demonstrating a scaling law in which prediction accuracy improves with increasing training data size. High-throughput screening with the model enables the identification of materials exhibiting extreme thermal conductivities -- both high and low. The resulting database offers valuable insights into the anharmonic behavior of phonons, thereby accelerating the design and development of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>MatTools: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Science Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Novel Charge Density Wave Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate ($2 \times 2\times 1$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy and TEM, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate ($2\times2\times1$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW superstructure of the monolayer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation performed on ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} show that the observed ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} CDW superstructure has lower energy compared to that of the pristine undistorted ML and the CDW instability is driven by formation of strong soft-phonon modes. Our findings provide an important platform for understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} with layer numbers and V self-intercalation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Gaussian diffusion in transient microscopy using excess kurtosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques. However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -- such as Auger recombination and trap states -- reproduce these experimental observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.</description>

      <title>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trigonal solid-state defects are often subjects of spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by the $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller effect, reflecting strong electron-phonon coupling. These systems, particularly paramagnetic defect qubits in solids are central for quantum technology applications, where accurate knowledge of their fine-structure parameters $-$ shaped by the complex interplay of spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions $-$ is essential. We introduce the Exe.py code part of the jahn-teller-dynamics package, a Python code that implements the first-principles approach of [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021063 (2018)] to accurately compute the spin-orbit-phonon entanglement in trigonal defects utilizing the output from density functional theory calculations (DFT). By employing $\Delta$SCF calculations, the method extends naturally to excited states and predicts fine-structure parameters of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), including Zeeman shifts under external magnetic fields. The approach is applicable not only to solid-state defects but also to Jahn-Teller active trigonal molecules such as the $X$CH$_3$ family. We demonstrate the capabilities of Exe.py through applications to negatively charged Group-IV$-$vacancy (G4V) defects in diamond: SiV$^-$, GeV$^-$, SnV$^-$, PbV$^-$ and the neutral N$_3$V$^0$ defect in diamond, and the CH$_3$O methoxy radical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</description>

Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Search for Superconductors Using Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Prediction of critical temperature $(T_c)$ of a superconductor remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. While the BCS theory explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, there is no framework to predict $T_c$ of unconventional, higher $T_{c}$ superconductors. Quantum Structure Diagrams (QSD) were successful in establishing structure-property relationship for superconductors, quasicrystals, and ferroelectric materials starting from chemical composition. Building on the QSD ideas, we demonstrate that the principal component analysis of superconductivity data uncovers the clustering of various classes of superconductors. We use machine learning analysis and cleaned databases of superconductors to develop predictive models of $T_c$ of a superconductor using its chemical composition. Earlier studies relied on datasets with inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, we introduce a data-cleaning workflow to enhance the statistical quality of superconducting databases by eliminating redundancies and resolving inconsistencies. With this improvised database, we apply a supervised machine learning framework and develop a Random Forest model to predict superconductivity and $T_c$ as a function of descriptors motivated from Quantum Structure Diagrams. We demonstrate that this model generalizes effectively in reasonably accurate prediction of $T_{c}$ of compounds outside the database. We further employ our model to systematically screen materials across materials databases as well as various chemically plausible combinations of elements and predict $\mathrm{Tl}_{5}\mathrm{Ba}_{6}\mathrm{Ca}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{9}\mathrm{O}_{29}$ to exhibit superconductivity with a $T_{c}$ $\sim$ 105 K. Being based on the descriptors used in QSD's, our model bypasses structural information and predicts $T_{c}$ merely from the chemical composition.</description>
