      <title>Lithium niobate acoustic resonators operating beyond 900 $^\circ$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, fundamental shear-horizontal SH0 mode Leaky Surface Acoustic Wave (LSAW) resonators on X-cut lithium niobate leveraging dense and robust electrodes such as gold and tungsten are demonstrated for extreme temperature operation in harsh environments. A novel post-processing approach based on in-band spurious mode tracking is introduced to enable reliable characterization under extreme parasitic loading during testing. Devices exhibit stable performance throughout multiple thermal cycles up to 1000 $^\circ$C, with an extrapolated electromechanical coupling coefficient kt2 = 25% and loaded quality factor Qp = 12 at 1000 $^\circ$C for tungsten devices, and kt2 = 17%, Qp = 100 at 900 $^\circ$C for gold devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of narrow-band $\gamma$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam -- with prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diamond superlattice with a period length of 3.54 $\mu$m was grown on a high quality straight (100) diamond plate with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). A sinusoidal varying boron doping profile resulted in a periodic variation of the lattice constant, and in turn four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes with a period length of 5.0 $\mu$m and an amplitude of 0.138 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility. Part of the impinging electrons perform sinusoidal oscillations resulting in the emission of quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$ radiation. A clear peak was observed with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.33 MeV. Gross properties like photon energy, width and intensity of the peak can be reproduced fairly well by idealized Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, prospects of applying such $\gamma$ radiation sources are addressed with the example of the photonuclear reaction $^{100}$Mo($\gamma$,n)$^{99}$Mo at 14.3 MeV to produce the medical important $^{99m}$Tc isotope.</description>

      <title>Passive All-Optical Nonlinear Neuron Activation via PPLN Nanophotonic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern life, yet the growing scale of AI applications places mounting demands on computational resources, raising sustainability concerns. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a promising alternative, enabling massive parallelism, low latency, and reduced electrical overhead, particularly excelling in high-throughput linear operations. However, passive and fully optical nonlinear activation functions with equally superb performance remain rare, posing a critical bottleneck in realizing all-optical neural networks on PICs. Here, we demonstrate a compact and readily integrated all-optical nonlinear activation function, experimentally realized through highly pump-depleted second-harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides, achieving 79% absolute conversion efficiency. This activation exhibits a sigmoid-like, wavelength-selective response with femtosecond-scale dynamics and light-speed processing, requiring no electrical control or auxiliary optical signals. We further validate its feasibility for neural inference by combining the measured SHG-based nonlinearity with linear operations implemented via a Mach-Zehnder interferometer system on a silicon PIC. Our demonstration achieves performance on par with digital implementations in real-world tasks, including airfoil regression and medical image classification. These results pave the way toward scalable, high-speed, and fully integrated all-optical neural networks for next-generation photonic AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Copper-impurity-free photonic integrated circuits enable deterministic soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) enable GHz-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compactness, and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing. Silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits have become a leading platform due to their low loss, broad transparency, lithographic dispersion control, and commercial 200-mm-wafer foundry access. They have enabled system-level applications in optical communications, LiDAR, frequency synthesis, low-noise microwave generation, and convolutional processing. However, real-world deployment is hindered by the challenge of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to thermal instabilities. Although techniques like pulsed pumping, fast scanning, and auxiliary lasers help mitigate these effects, they often add complexity or reduce soliton stability. In this work, we overcome thermal limitations and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in silicon nitride photonic circuits. We trace the thermal effects to copper impurities within waveguides, originating from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade silicon wafers that are gettered into silicon nitride during fabrication. By developing effective copper removal techniques, we significantly reduce thermal instabilities. This enables soliton generation with arbitrary or slow laser scanning, removing a key barrier to microcomb deployment. Our approach is compatible with front-end-of-line foundry processing, paving the way for broader adoption of soliton microcomb technologies.</description>

      <title>Classical Interfaces for Controlling Cryogenic Quantum Computing Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors have the potential to revolutionise computing on a scale unseen since the development of semiconductor technology in the middle of the 20th century. However, while there is now huge activity and investment in the field, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome before the technology can be fully realised. Of primary concern is the development of the classical technology required to interface with quantum systems, as we push towards a new era of high-performance, large-scale quantum computing.
  In this review, we briefly discuss some of the main challenges facing the development of universally useful quantum computers and the different architectures being investigated. We are primarily concerned with cryogenic quantum systems. These systems are among the most mature quantum computing architectures to date, and are garnering a lot of both industrial and academic attention.
  We present and analyse the leading methods of interfacing with quantum processors, both now and for the next generation of larger, multi-qubit systems. Recent advancements in control cryoelectronics, both semiconducting and superconducting, are covered, while a view towards newer methods such as optical and wireless qubit interfaces are also presented.</description>

      <title>Integrative Learning of Quantum Dot Intensity Fluctuations under Excitation via Tailored Dynamic Mixture Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.</description>

      <title>Biorealistic Response in Optoelectrically-Driven Flexible Halide-Perovskite Single-Crystal Memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to smart wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices communicating with each other and performing neuromorphic computing at the edge is a big goal in next-generation optoelectronics. These devices should perform their regular tasks supported by energy-efficient in-memory calculations. Here, we study the response of the CsPbBr$_3$ halide-perovskite single crystal fabricated on the flexible polymer substrate and integrated with the single-walled carbon nanotube thin film electrodes in a lateral geometry. We show both photodetection functions combined with the synaptic functionality in our device under the application of hybrid optoelectrical stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our device exhibits frequency-dependent bidirectional modification of synaptic weight with a sliding threshold similar to biologically plausible Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning. The demonstrated optoelectronic synaptic behavior in halide-perovskite single-crystals opens the opportunity for the development of hybrid organic-inorganic artificial visual systems.</description>

      <title>Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magnetoionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>
