      <title>Terabyte-Scale Analytics in the Blink of an Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past two decades, the DB community has devoted substantial research to take advantage of cheap clusters of machines for distributed data analytics -- we believe that we are at the beginning of a paradigm shift. The scaling laws and popularity of AI models lead to the deployment of incredibly powerful GPU clusters in commercial data centers. Compared to CPU-only solutions, these clusters deliver impressive improvements in per-node compute, memory bandwidth, and inter-node interconnect performance. In this paper, we study the problem of scaling analytical SQL queries on distributed clusters of GPUs, with the stated goal of establishing an upper bound on the likely performance gains. To do so, we build a prototype designed to maximize performance by leveraging ML/HPC best practices, such as group communication primitives for cross-device data movements. This allows us to conduct thorough performance experimentation to point our community towards a massive performance opportunity of at least 60$\times$. To make these gains more relatable, before you can blink twice, our system can run all 22 queries of TPC-H at a 1TB scale factor!</description>

      <title>Not all those who drift are lost: Drift correction and calibration scheduling for the IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensors provide a vital source of data that link digital systems with the physical world. However, as sensors age, the relationship between what they measure and what they output changes. This is known as sensor drift and poses a significant challenge that, combined with limited opportunity for re-calibration, can severely limit data quality over time. Previous approaches to drift correction typically require large volumes of ground truth data and do not consider measurement or prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic sensor drift correction method that takes a fundamental approach to modelling the sensor response using Gaussian Process Regression. Tested using dissolved oxygen sensors, our method delivers mean squared error (MSE) reductions of up to 90% and more than 20% on average. We also propose a novel uncertainty-driven calibration schedule optimisation approach that builds on top of drift correction and further reduces MSE by up to 15.7%.</description>

      <title>Linking Data Citation to Repository Visibility: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's data-driven research landscape, dataset visibility and accessibility play a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge. At the same time, data citation is essential for maintaining academic integrity, acknowledging contributions, validating research outcomes, and fostering scientific reproducibility. As a critical link, it connects scholarly publications with the datasets that drive scientific progress. This study investigates whether repository visibility influences data citation rates. We hypothesize that repositories with higher visibility, as measured by search engine metrics, are associated with increased dataset citations. Using OpenAlex data and repository impact indicators (including the visibility index from Sistrix, the h-index of repositories, and citation metrics such as mean and median citations), we analyze datasets in Social Sciences and Economics to explore their relationship. Our findings suggest that datasets hosted on more visible web domains tend to receive more citations, with a positive correlation observed between web domain visibility and dataset citation counts, particularly for datasets with at least one citation. However, when analyzing domain-level citation metrics, such as the h-index, mean, and median citations, the correlations are inconsistent and weaker. While higher visibility domains tend to host datasets with greater citation impact, the distribution of citations across datasets varies significantly. These results suggest that while visibility plays a role in increasing citation counts, it is not the sole factor influencing dataset citation impact. Other elements, such as dataset quality, research trends, and disciplinary norms, also contribute significantly to citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Microservices and Real-Time Processing in Retail IT: A Review of Open-Source Toolchains and Deployment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid pace of digital transformation, the retail industry is increasingly depending on real-time, scalable, and resilient systems to manage financial transactions, analyze customer behavior, and streamline order processing. This literature review explores how modern event-driven and microservices-based architectures, particularly those leveraging Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Kubernetes are transforming retail and financial systems. By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white papers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key themes and implementation strategies. The analysis reveals that technologies like Kafka and Spring Boot are instrumental in building low-latency, event-driven applications that support real-time analytics and fraud detection, while MongoDB, when deployed on Kubernetes, ensures fault tolerance and high availability in inventory and transaction systems. Kubernetes itself plays a crucial role in automating deployment and scaling of microservices. These findings provide valuable insights for industry practitioners aiming to design scalable infrastructures, identify research opportunities in hybrid deployment models, and offer educators a foundation to integrate modern system architectures into professional and technical communication training.</description>

      <title>GenJoin: Conditional Generative Plan-to-Plan Query Optimizer that Learns from Subplan Hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query optimization has become a research area where classical algorithms are being challenged by machine learning algorithms. At the same time, recent trends in learned query optimizers have shown that it is prudent to take advantage of decades of database research and augment classical query optimizers by shrinking the plan search space through different types of hints (e.g. by specifying the join type, scan type or the order of joins) rather than completely replacing the classical query optimizer with machine learning models. It is especially relevant for cases when classical optimizers cannot fully enumerate all logical and physical plans and, as an alternative, need to rely on less robust approaches like genetic algorithms. However, even symbiotically learned query optimizers are hampered by the need for vast amounts of training data, slow plan generation during inference and unstable results across various workload conditions. In this paper, we present GenJoin - a novel learned query optimizer that considers the query optimization problem as a generative task and is capable of learning from a random set of subplan hints to produce query plans that outperform the classical optimizer. GenJoin is the first learned query optimizer that significantly and consistently outperforms PostgreSQL as well as state-of-the-art methods on two well-known real-world benchmarks across a variety of workloads using rigorous machine learning evaluations.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Uses of Regulatory Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organizations need to manage numerous business processes for delivering their services and products to customers. One important consideration thereby lies in the adherence to regulations such as laws, guidelines, or industry standards. In order to monitor adherence of their business processes to regulations -- in other words, their regulatory compliance -- organizations make use of various techniques that draw on process execution data of IT systems that support these processes. Previous research has investigated conformance checking, an operation of process mining, for the domains in which it is applied, its operationalization of regulations, the techniques being used, and the presentation of results produced. However, other techniques for regulatory compliance monitoring, which we summarize as compliance checking techniques, have not yet been investigated regarding these aspects in a structural manner. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review on uses of regulatory compliance monitoring of business processes, thereby offering insights into the various techniques being used, their application and the results they generate. We highlight commonalities and differences between the approaches and find that various steps are performed manually; we also provide further impulses for research on compliance monitoring and its use in practice.</description>

      <title>Griffin: Towards a Graph-Centric Relational Database Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.
