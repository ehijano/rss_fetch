      <title>Idealized Cumulus Cloud-Scale Motions and the Dynamics of Isolated and Coupled Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an understandable theory for the dynamic evolution of the morphology of clouds remains intractable. To break this deadlock, we introduce a new conceptual model for cloud-scale motions named the Kinematics Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model, where non-rotating reflects the absence of motion in the azimuthal direction. Using this model, we conduct a series of relaxation experiments whereby we ``turn off'' the baroclinic term associated with a pre-existing cloud-scale circulation. We then implement a moment reduction technique to generate a system of differential equations named the Dynamics of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (DoNUT) equations, which describe the temporal evolution of a cloudy circulation under various combinations of forcings, namely turbulent diffusion, self-advection, and cross-advection from a neighboring cloud-scale flow. The solutions of the DoNUT equations show that all single KRoNUT configurations either start at or evolve toward a specific steady state circulation. The cloud-scale motions represented by the current KRoNUT model always grow vertically but may narrow, due to advection, or widen, due to diffusion. Meanwhile, invigoration or enervation of the vertical velocity may result from advection or diffusion processes, with short, wide KRoNUTs more likely to invigorate and tall, narrow KRoNUTs likely to enervate. Our study of the coupled KRoNUTs provides insight into clouds' tendencies to attract or repel one another. Important results of the coupled KRoNUT analysis include a scaled metric for interaction, ranges of specific height ratios that induce the most meaningful interaction, and circulation parameters that alter the location and stability of a steady KRoNUT.</description>

      <title>Hydroacoustic Absorption and Amplification by Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic waves propagating through fluid media are significantly influenced by turbulence. This paper experimentally investigates the influence of underwater turbulence on the propagation characteristics of acoustic waves, revealing that acoustic waves can be absorbed or amplified at frequencies far exceeding the turbulent fluctuation frequency. The maximum observed attenuation or amplification of received signals exceeds 60%, with no spectral broadening. The study covers two flow conditions: pipe flow and free jet, driven by either a pump or hydraulic head difference. Hydroacoustic transducers with frequencies ranging from 60 kHz to 4.4 MHz are used, while the wave propagation directions both parallel and perpendicular to the mean flow are considered. The variation trend and magnitude of received signals depend on wave frequency, amplitude and flow conditions. For each case, the amplitudes of all frequency components simultaneously decreases or increases under turbulence, with no new spectral components appearing. After closing the flow control valve, the receiver signal requires a finite time to stabilize to its quiescent-state value. In contrast, suction near the pipe outlet shows that laminar flow has no effect on acoustic signals, confirming that the primary cause of signal variation is turbulent fluctuations rather than mean flow. Comparison with conventional theories and experiments indicates that mechanisms such as bubbles, resonance, scattering, or viscous dissipation cannot explain the observed phenomena. This suggests the existence of a previously unknown interaction mechanism between turbulence and acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an internally actuated weakly elastic sphere in a general quadratic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internally actuated elastic particles are widely used in biomedical applications. It is imperative to understand the dynamics of such particles in pressure-driven microfluidic devices to manipulate their motion. We analytically examine the dynamics of an internally actuated elastic particle translating in a general unbounded quadratic flow in the inertialess limit. We consider the particle as a compressible weakly elastic sphere, and its motion is controlled by applying an external point force and a point torque at the centre of its undeformed shape. The fluid and the particle are modelled using the Stokes and the Navier elasticity equations, respectively. We use the domain perturbation method to capture the particle deformation. The point force and the point torque are obtained until \textit{O}($\alpha^2$), assuming $\alpha\ll 1$. Here, $\alpha$ is the measure of the particle elastic strain induced due to the fluid viscous stress. We present the results for the particle motion in a general unbounded quadratic flow. The results are simplified further for the motion along the centreline in the quadratic component of three Poiseuille flows: 1) elliptical Poiseuille, 2) plane Poiseuille, and 3) Hagen-Poiseuille flows. In the general quadratic flow, the point force at \textit{O}($\alpha$) is aligned with the particle velocity, while the force at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$) acts at an angle to the velocity. Furthermore, the torque is non-zero due to elastic effects at \textit{O}($\alpha$) and \textit{O}($\alpha^2$). For all the three Poiseuille flows, the point force until \textit{O}($\alpha^2$) is aligned with the particle velocity, while the torque comes as zero.</description>

      <title>Scalable CFD Simulations in Multi-Billion Voxel Micro-CT Images of Porous Materials Using OpenFOAM on ARCHER2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) to simulate flow and transport in ultra-large micro-CT images of porous materials using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Two distinct rock samples, representative of two different rock formations - Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate - are investigated. The Bentheimer sandstone image, with dimensions 1,950x1,950x10,800 voxels at 6 micron resolution, comprising 41 billion voxels, represents a largely homogeneous structure, while the Estaillades carbonate image, at 1,144x1,144x6,000 voxels and 3.9676 micron resolution, amounting to 8 billion voxels, features greater heterogeneity, including micro-porous regions. These images are used for direct CFD simulations with GeoChemFoam, our OpenFOAM-based numerical solver, leveraging the computational resources of the UK supercomputer ARCHER2. One of the key aspects of the study is the use of the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes approach, for which the solid surface is represented using a volumetric indicator function, rather than a complex mesh. This enables the use of simple Cartesian meshes that can be generated in parallel in an efficient and scalable manner. The study explores both weak and strong scaling through subvolume decomposition, demonstrating that, due to the strong scalability and the computational power of ARCHER2, full-resolution CFD simulations can be carried out without the need for image size reduction. This work illustrates the potential of HPC to perform detailed, full-scale simulations on large, high-resolution micro-CT data. The approach relies on a meshing strategy that leverages simple, parallelisable Cartesian grids derived from volumetric indicator functions, eliminating the need for complex surface-conforming meshes and allowing scalable simulation of flow and transport in geological and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Transition in elastic Dean flow: the centre-mode versus hoop-stress pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of viscoelastic Dean flow (flow of an elastic fluid through a curved two-dimensional channel, driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient) in the absence of fluid inertia. This configuration is well known to exhibit a hoop-stress-driven `purely elastic' instability (referred to henceforth as the hoop-stress mode -- `HSM') on account of the base-flow streamline curvature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence and importance of a distinct elastic instability in this flow configuration, which is not driven by hoop-stresses, but instead is a continuation of a novel `centre-mode' (CM) instability recently identified in rectilinear shear flows. We use both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models to map out parameter regimes in the $W\!i$--$\epsilon$--$\beta$ space where the aforementioned instabilities are present. Here, $W\!i$ is a suitably defined Weissenberg number that characterizes fluid elasticity, $\beta$ is the ratio of solvent to total solution viscosity, and $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the gap (channel) width to the radius of curvature. For FENE-P model, decreasing the finite extensibility parameter $L$ has opposing effects on the HSM and CM instabilities -- stabilising the former, but destabilising the latter. In the dilute solution regime ($\beta &gt; 0.95$), and for realistic values of $L \sim O(100)$, corresponding to polymer molecular weights of $O(10^{5-6})$g/mol, the CM remains the most unstable mode for $\epsilon \leq 0.25$, rendering it potentially relevant to the onset of elastic turbulence in the flow of such polymer solutions through curved channels.</description>

      <title>Stretching and breaking of particles in compressible random flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature of turbulent suspensions that involve floating particles on the surface or inertial particles in the bulk is the compressibility of the effective particle-phase velocity field. Little, however, is known about the effects of small-scale flow compressibility on the stretching and breaking of particles. Here, we gain insight into the nature of these effects by studying the deformation of tiny particles in model fluctuating flows. We consider a generic particle with extensional dynamics that are governed by a vector model, which accounts for elasticity, internal viscosity, and non-affine deformation. Applying the dynamical systems approach of Balkovsky, Fouxon &amp; Lebedev (2000), we first obtain general results for the stationary statistics of particle extension in compressible chaotic flows. We then specialize to a time-decorrelated Gaussian random flow and derive an exact solution for the Batchelor regime of the compressible Kraichnan model. We also perform numerical simulations for a time-correlated renewing flow. While straining is suppressed on the average in compressible flows, our results show that large deviations of the strain rate strongly stretch particles and give rise to a power-law distribution of extensions. Extreme straining events are particularly important for stiff particles and, in the examples considered here, give rise to a counter-intuitive effect: stiff particles stretch more and break faster in flows of increasing compressibility. Highly-elastic particles, whose deformation is dictated by the mean straining, stretch less and break slower. Though based on specific random flows, our work shows how compressibility can affect the extensional dynamics of particles by altering the fluctuations of the strain rate, including its large deviations.</description>

      <title>Centrifugal instability of Taylor-Couette flow in stratified and diffusive fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear and non-linear dynamics of centrifugal instability in Taylor-Couette flow are investigated when fluids are stably stratified and highly diffusive. One-dimensional local linear stability analysis (LSA) on cylindrical Couette flow confirms that the stabilising role of stratification on centrifugal instability is suppressed by strong thermal diffusion (i.e. low Prandtl number $Pr$). For $Pr\ll1$, it is verified that the instability dependence on thermal diffusion and stratification with the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ can be prescribed by a single rescaled parameter $P_{N}=N^{2}Pr$. From direct numerical simulation (DNS), various non-linear features such as axisymmetric Taylor vortices at saturation, secondary instability leading to non-axisymmetric patterns or transition to chaotic states are investigated for various values of $Pr\leq1$ and the Reynolds number $Re_{i}$. Two-dimensional bi-global LSA on axisymmetric Taylor vortices, which appear as primary centrifugal instability saturates nonlinearly, is also performed to find the secondary critical Reynolds number $Re_{i,2}$ at which the Taylor vortices become unstable by non-axisymmetric perturbation. The bi-global LSA reveals that $Re_{i,2}$ increases (i.e. the onset of secondary instability is delayed) in the range $10^{-3}&lt;Pr&lt;1$ at $N=1$ or as $N$ increases at $Pr=0.01$. Secondary instability leading to highly non-axisymmetric or irregular chaotic patterns is further investigated by the 3D DNS. The Nusselt number $Nu$ is also computed from the torque at the inner cylinder for various $Pr$ and $Re_{i}$ at $N=1$ to describe how the angular momentum transfer increases with $Re_{i}$ and how $Nu$ varies differently for saturated and chaotic states.</description>

      <title>Long-time evolution of density layers and interfaces in forced stably-stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stably stratified fluids subject to sustained forcing are known to develop step-like density "staircases", where nearly homogeneous layers alternate with thin interfaces of strong stratification. However, long-time numerical investigations of this phenomenon have been limited by the intrinsically slow evolution of large-scale modes and the sensitivity of stratified turbulence to physical parameters. We present direct numerical simulations of forced Boussinesq flows for three stratification strengths (Fr = 0.42, 0.22, 0.076) and of unprecedented time extensions - up to O(10000) turnover times - with the purpose of reproducing and studying the very slow coarsening of the layered state. A large-scale friction term is introduced to arrest shear-mode growth and mimic finite-domain constraints. Staircase formation is observed for both medium and strong stratified cases, following two different coarsening dynamics: interfaces decaying or merging. While kinetic energy remains quasi-stationary during interface decay, it exhibits sharp bursts during merging events. The emergence and persistence of density steps can be explained by the non-monotonic relation between buoyancy flux and buoyancy gradient. Intermittency in vertical velocity and density fluctuations is confined to the vicinity of layer-interface boundaries, indicating that strong events arise from the interaction between turbulent mixing and layer formation rather than from regions of large density gradients alone.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation in two-dimensional regular and turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zermelo's navigation problem seeks the trajectory of minimal travel time between two points in a fluid flow. We address this problem for an agent -- such as a micro-robot or active particle -- that is advected by a two-dimensional flow, self-propels at a fixed speed smaller than or comparable to the characteristic flow velocity, and can steer its direction. The flows considered span increasing levels of complexity, from steady solid-body rotation to the Taylor-Green flow and fully developed turbulence in the inverse cascade regime. Although optimal control theory provides time-minimizing trajectories, these solutions become unstable in chaotic regimes realized for complex background flows. To design robust navigation strategies under such conditions, we apply reinforcement learning. Both action-value (Q-learning) and policy-gradient (one-step actor-critic) methods achieve successful navigation with comparable performance. Crucially, we show that agents trained on coarse-grained flows -- retaining only large-scale features -- generalize effectively to the full turbulent field. This robustness to incomplete flow information is essential for practical navigation in real-world oceanic and atmospheric environments.</description>

      <title>Axial Symmetric Navier Stokes Equations and the Beltrami /anti Beltrami spectrum in view of Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply reprised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>

      <title>CFD-copilot: leveraging domain-adapted large language model and model context protocol to enhance simulation automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations requires significant expertise in physics modeling and numerical methods, posing a barrier to non-specialists. Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>Vortex leapfrogging and superfluid dissipation mechanisms in a fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids.</description>

      <title>Two-phase hydrodynamic model of active colloid motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a two-phase hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of collective motion in a thin layer of active colloids containing spherical microswimmers. The model accounts for three fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of the active colloid: the random motion of the microswimmers, their mutual collisions, and their interaction with the surrounding fluid phase. The accurate resolution of the characteristic time scales associated with each mechanism is crucial for reproducing the different dynamic modes. The model reproduces two primary modes of motion: Brownian and collective, as well as the transition between them. It is demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions begin to play a significant role when the microswimmer velocity exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the kinetic energy transferred to the fluid phase is sufficient to generate a noticeable feedback effect on the swimmers' motion. Conversely, a further increase in microswimmers' velocity enhances the role of collisions, causing the system to revert from a collective mode back to a Brownian-like state. A similar transition occurs at higher volume fractions of microswimmers within the colloid.</description>

      <title>Space-time discretization for barotropic flow stemming from a multisymplectic variational formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes and analyses a novel higher-order, structure preserving discretization method for inviscid barotropic flows from a Lagrangian perspective. The method is built on a multisymplectic variational principle discretized over a full space-time domain. Flow variables are encoded on a staggered space-time mesh, leveraging the principles of mimetic spectral element discretization. Unlike standard Lagrangian methods, which are prone to mesh distortion, this framework computes fluid deformations in a fixed reference configuration and systematically maps them to the physical domain via the Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Further, the structure preserving design ensures that the discrete analogues of the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are satisfied up to machine precision. The formulation also inherently handles low-Mach number flows without specialized preconditioning. Numerical experiments on expansion and compression flows confirm the accuracy, stability, and exact conservation properties of the discretization.</description>

      <title>Wave induced fracture of a sea ice analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study at the laboratory scale the rupture of thin floating sheets made of a brittle material under a wave-induced mechanical forcing. We show that the rupture occurs where the curvature is maximum and the break-up threshold strongly depends on the wave properties. We observe that the critical stress for fracture depends on the forcing wavelength. Hence our observations are incompatible with a critical stress criterion for fracture. Instead, our measurements can be rationalized as an energy criterion: a fracture propagates when the material surface energy is lower than the released elastic energy, which depends on the forcing geometry. In light of these findings, it may be worthwhile to revisit current numerical models of sea ice fracture by ocean waves.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical study on hydrogen bubble growth at electrode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of electrolysis is applied to investigate the growth and detachment of bubbles at electrodes.
  The moving gas-liquid interface is modeled employing the VOF-based method. To ensure the accuracy of the simulations,
  a mesh-independence study has been performed.
  The simulations include the growth phase of the bubbles, followed by their detachment from the electrode surface
  and the results are validated with analytical models and experimental data.
  The bubble growth is diffusion-controlled, leading to the scaling \(R = 2\beta t^{1/2}\), but our simulation overpredicts the growth exponent during the initial stage.
  We further demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites significantly affects gas transport, as quantified by the Sherwood number.
  The influences of contact angle and nucleation site on bubble detachment are also examined.
  The predicted detachment radius varies linearly with contact angle, consistent with the well-known relation
  \( R_{det}=0.6 \theta \sqrt{\sigma/(\rho_c-\rho_d)g}\) between the volume-equivalent radius and contact angle, confirming that the surface tension is the dominant attachment force.
  Finally, as the nucleation sites increase, the induced bubble coalescence accelerates the bubble detachment. Taken together,
  these findings give us valuable insights into improving gas bubble removal and enhancing overall electrolysis efficiency.</description>

      <title>Waves in a shear flow: transition between the KH, Holmboe and Miles instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate shear driven wave generation at the interface between two immiscible fluids, using an exponential velocity profile with a sharp density interface representing stable stratification. At low Froude and high Bond numbers, conditions relevant to geophysical and astrophysical flows, we identify a novel transition in the fastest growing mode: from Kelvin Helmholtz (KH) instability at high density ratio (delta = 0.9), to Holmboe (H) instability as delta approaches 0.5, and ultimately to the Miles (1957) critical layer instability as delta approaches 0.001, representative of the air water system. Remarkably, the Miles mode, characterized by a sharp jump in inviscid Reynolds stress (tau) at the critical layer, persists up to delta = 0.01, i.e., ten times the air water value. As delta increases, the vertical variation of tau undergoes a qualitative change, from a sharp jump at the critical layer for delta much less than 1 to a smooth transition through it for delta greater than or equal to 0.5. A theoretical explanation is provided. In the moderate to high density ratio regime, comparison with a piecewise-linear (PL) velocity profile confirms the presence of both H and KH instabilities in the exponential profile. Nonlinear simulations of the incompressible Euler equations with gravity and surface tension show excellent agreement with linear theory for delta = 0.01 up to five wave periods. At delta = 0.1, waves saturate into finite-amplitude structures with capillary ripples, while at delta = 0.5, the waves develop sheared cusps and emit spume, resembling asymmetric Holmboe waves observed experimentally. At delta = 0.9, the waves rapidly evolve into classic KH spirals. Comparisons with the PL profile highlight the role of background curvature and the critical layer. This work presents, for the first time, all three canonical instabilities within a single background state.</description>

      <title>Unsteady aerodynamic theory and experiments of hovering membrane wings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the unsteady lift response of compliant membrane wings in hovering kinematics by combining analytical inviscid theory with experimental results. An unsteady aerodynamic model is derived for a compliant thin aerofoil immersed in incompressible inviscid flow of variable freestream velocity at high angles of attack. The model, representing a spanwise section of a hovering membrane wing, assumes small membrane deformation and attached flow. These assumptions are supported by experiments showing that passive membrane deformation suppresses flow separation when hovering at angles of attack up to $55^\circ$. An analytically derived expression is obtained for the unsteady lift response, incorporating the classical Wagner and Theodorsen functions and the membrane dynamic response. This theoretical expression is validated against experimental water-tank measurements that are performed on hovering membrane wings at angles of attack of $35^\circ$ and $55^\circ$. Data from membrane deformation measurements is applied to the theoretical lift expression, providing the theoretical lift response prediction for each of the available experimental scenarios. Results of the comparison show that the proposed theory accurately predicts unsteady lift contributions from membrane deformation at high angles of attack, provided the deformation remains small and the flow is attached. This agreement between inviscid theory and experimental measurements suggests that when flow separation is suppressed, the unsteady aerodynamic theory is valid well beyond the typical low angle of attack regime.</description>

      <title>On the analytical behavior of the $k$--$\omega$ turbulence model in buoyant-driven thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, particularly under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$\omega$ model for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection in an infinite layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($\mathit{Ra}$), Prandtl ($\mathit{Pr}$), and Nusselt ($\mathit{Nu}$) numbers that capture the simulation trends: $\mathit{Nu} \sim \mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\mathit{Pr}^{1/3}$ for $\mathit{Pr} \ll 1$ and $\mathit{Nu} \sim \mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\mathit{Pr}^{-0.415}$ for $\mathit{Pr} \gg 1$. This framework quantifies the discrepancies in the conventional buoyancy treatment and clarifies their origin. Informed by this analysis, the buoyancy-related modelling terms are reformulated to recover the measured $\mathit{Nu}$--$\mathit{Ra}$--$\mathit{Pr}$ trends. Only two dimensionless algebraic functions are introduced, which vanish in the absence of buoyancy, ensuring full compatibility with the standard closure. The corrected model is validated across a range of buoyancy-driven flows, including two-dimensional Rayleigh--B\'enard convection, internally heated convection in two configurations, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, it provides highly accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.</description>
