      <title>Normalized solutions for Choquard equations with critical nonlinearities on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is the study of the existence of normalized solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlocal nonlinearities: \begin{equation}\nonumber \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u =\lambda u+(I_\alpha*|u|^{2_\alpha^*})|u|^{2_\alpha^*-2}u+a(I_\alpha*|u|^p)|u|^{p-2}u,\ x\in\Omega,\\ &amp;u&gt;0\ \text {in}\ \Omega,\ u=0\ \text {on}\ \partial \Omega,\ \int _{\Omega}|u|^2dx=c, \end{aligned} \right.  \end{equation} where $c&gt;0,\ \alpha \in (0,N),\ \frac{N+\alpha+2}{N}&lt;p&lt;\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}=2_\alpha^*,\ a\ge 0,\ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N (N \ge 3)$ is smooth, bounded, star-shaped and $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential. We prove the existence of two positive normalized solutions, one of which is a ground state and the other is a mountain pass solution.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic convexity of evolution equations and application to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some results on the logarithmic convexity for evolution equations, a well-known method in inverse and ill-posed problems. We start with the classical case of self-adjoint operators. Then, we analyze the case of analytic semigroups. In this general case, we give an explicit estimate, which will be used to study inverse problems for initial data recovery. We illustrate our abstract result by an application to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations. We discuss both analytic and non-analytic semigroups. We conclude with recent results for the time-fractional evolution equations with the Caputo derivative of order $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$. We start with symmetric evolution equations. Then, we show that the results extend to the non-symmetric case for diffusion equations, provided that a gradient vector field generates the drift coefficient. Finally, some open problems will be mentioned.</description>

      <title>On solutions to Hardy-Sobolev equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension at least $3$. Let $S$ be the union of the focal submanifolds of an isoparametric function on $(M,g)$. In this article we address the existence of solutions of the Hardy-Sobolev type equation $\Delta_g u+K(x)u=\frac{u^{q-1}}{\left(d_{S}(x)\right)^s}$, where $d_{S}(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to $S$ and $q&gt;2$. In particular, we will prove the existence of infinite sign-changing solutions to the equation.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Solutions of the Logarithmic Laplacian: An Approach via the Division Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of the fundamental solution of the logarithmic Laplacian (in dimensions $d \geq 3$) was established by Huyuan Chen and Laurent V\'eron (2024). In this note, we present an alternative approach, based on a modification on the classical division problem. This is inspired by the theory of fundamental solutions by Malgrange and Ehrenpreis. Moreover, we give a variant of the Liouville theorem for the logarithmic Laplacian and give some further clarification regarding a conjecture posed by Chen and V\'eron regarding the behavior of solutions in dimensions 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric self-similar solutions to the MHD equations without magnetic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axisymmetric self-similar solutions $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{B})$ to the stationary MHD equations without magnetic diffusion, where $\mathbf{B}$ has only the swirl component. Our first result states that in $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}$, $\mathbf{u}$ is a Landau solution and $\mathbf{B}=0$. Our second result proves the triviality of axisymmetric self-similar solutions in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^3_+$ with the no-slip boundary condition or the Navier slip boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Gamma-convergence of nonlocal energies for partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that certain nonlocal functionals defined on partitions made of measurable sets Gamma-converge to a local functional modeled on the perimeter in the sense of De Giorgi. Those nonlocal functionals involve generalized surface tension coefficients, and are lower semicontinuous even if the coefficients do not satisfy the triangular inequality. It implies a relaxation process in the limit, and provides a novel effect compare to the known gamma-convergence of the fractional perimeter towards the standard perimeter.</description>

      <title>Fractional multi-phase transitions and nonlocal minimal partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of certain models for phase transitions involving nonlocal energies. A first part is concerned with to the asymptotic analysis of a system of fractional elliptic equations of Allen-Cahn type as a characteristic small parameter tends to zero. It is shown that solutions converge to critical points of a nonlocal geometric energy defined over a class of partitions of the domain. A regularity analysis for solutions of the geometric problem is also performed, in the minimizing and non minimizing case. The limiting geometric problem involves generalized surface tension coefficients which might not satisfy the usual triangular inequality. A more detailed regularity analysis for minimizers is performed for 3-partitions, in particular in the case where one triangular inequality strictly holds in the reverse sense.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and anti-maximum principles for semilinear and linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with existence and qualitative properties of positive solutions of semilinear elliptic equations in bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show the existence of positive solutions in the vicinity of the linear equation and the log-concavity of the solutions when the domain is strictly convex. We also review the standard results on the log-concavity or the more general quasi-concavity of solutions of elliptic equations. The existence and other convergence results especially rely on the maximum principle, on a quantified version of the anti-maximum principle, on the Schauder fixed point theorem, and on some a priori estimates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the following Hamiltonian system: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\varepsilon^{2}\Delta_{g} u +u = |v|^{q-1}v,
  &amp;-\varepsilon^{2}\Delta_{g} v +v = |u|^{p-1}u &amp;&amp; \text{ in } \mathcal{M},
  &amp; \quad u,v &gt;0 &amp;&amp; \text{ in } \mathcal{M},
  \end{aligned}
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth, compact and connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $N\geq 3$ without boundary. The exponents $p,q&gt;1$ are assumed to lie below the critical hyperbola, ensuring subcritical growth conditions. We investigate a sequence of least energy critical points of the associated dual functional and analyze their concentration behavior as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Our main result shows that the sequence of solutions exhibits point concentration, with the concentration occurring at a point where the scalar curvature of $\mathcal{M}$ attains its maximum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish norm inequalities for fractional powers of degenerate Laplacians, with degeneracy being determined by weights in the Muckenhoupt class $A_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, accompanied by specific additional reverse H\"older assumptions. This extends the known results for classical Riesz potentials. The approach is based on size estimates for the degenerate heat kernels. The approach also applies to more general weighted degenerate operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach over diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate to every function $u\in GBD(\Omega)$ a measure $\mu_u$ with values in the space of symmetric matrices, which generalises the distributional symmetric gradient $Eu$ defined for functions of bounded deformation. We show that this measure $\mu_u$ admits a decomposition as the sum of three mutually singular matrix-valued measures $\mu^a_u$, $\mu^c_u$, and $\mu^j_u$, the absolutely continuous part, the Cantor part, and the jump part, as in the case of $BD(\Omega)$ functions. We then characterise the space $GSBD(\Omega)$, originally defined only by slicing, as the space of functions $u\in GBD(\Omega)$ such that $\mu^c_u=0$.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Anderson Model in the Hyperbolic Space. Part II: Quenched Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the exact quenched asymptotic growth of the solution to the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) in the hyperbolic space with a regular, stationary, time-independent Gaussian potential. More precisely, we show that with probability one, the solution $u$ to PAM with constant initial data has pointwise growth asymptotics \[ u(t,x)\sim e^{L^{*}t^{5/3}+o(t^{5/3})} \] as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. Both the power $t^{5/3}$ on the exponential and the exact value of $L^*$ are different from their counterparts in the Euclidean situation. They are determined through an explicit optimisation procedure. Our proof relies on certain fine localisation techniques, which also reveals a stronger non-Euclidean localisation mechanism.</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a very simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We assume the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature. We show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. We further assume that the metric $g$ is not degenerate in the sense that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive. With this extra assumption, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we also observe that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>

      <title>On gradient descent-ascent flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) flows play a central role in finding saddle points of bivariate functionals, with applications in optimization, game theory, and robust control. While they are well-understood in Hilbert and Banach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general metric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the product of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a system of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed functional $\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on $\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a novel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric spaces. We establish a $\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative error estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects analogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay bound for the Nikaid\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on Wasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time and the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique saddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals. Our framework unifies and extends existing analyses, offering a metric-geometric perspective on GDA dynamics in nonlinear and non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Blowup of Solutions to a Damped Euler Equation with Homogeneous Three-Point Boundary Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been established that solutions to the inviscid Proudman-Johnson equation subject to a homogeneous three-point boundary condition can develop singularities in finite time. In this paper, we consider the possibility of singularity formation in solutions of the generalized, inviscid Proudman-Johnson equation with damping subject to the same homogeneous three-point boundary condition. In particular, we derive conditions the initial data must satisfy in order for solutions to blowup in finite time with either bounded or unbounded smooth damping term.</description>

      <title>Stable determination of the first order perturbation of the biharmonic operator from partial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse boundary value problem for the biharmonic operator with the first order perturbation in a bounded domain of dimension three or higher. Assuming that the first and the zeroth order perturbations are known in a neighborhood of the boundary, we establish log-type stability estimates for these perturbations from a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Specifically, measurements are taken only on an arbitrarily small open subsets of the boundary.</description>

      <title>The nonlocal Harnack inequality for antisymmetric functions: an approach via Bochner's relation and harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a Harnack inequality for antisymmetric functions that has been recently established for the fractional Laplacian and we extend it to more general nonlocal elliptic operators.
  The new approach to deal with these problems that we propose in this paper leverages Bochner's relation, allowing one to relate a one-dimensional Fourier transform of an odd function with a three-dimensional Fourier transform of a radial function.
  In this way, Harnack inequalities for odd functions, which are essentially Harnack inequalities of boundary type, are reduced to interior Harnack inequalities.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on Euclidean spaces and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the momentum-based minimization of a diffuse perimeter functional on Euclidean spaces and on graphs with applications to semi-supervised classification tasks in machine learning. While the gradient flow in the task at hand is a parabolic partial differential equation, the momentum method corresponds to a damped hyperbolic PDE, leading to qualitatively and quantitatively different trajectories. Using a convex-concave splitting-based FISTA-type time discretization, we demonstrate empirically that momentum can lead to faster convergence if the time step size is large but not too large. With large time steps, the PDE analysis offers only limited insight into the geometric behavior of solutions and typical hyperbolic phenomena like loss of regularity are not be observed in sample simulations. We obtain the singular limit of the evolution equations as the length parameter of the phase fields tends to zero by formal expansions and numerically confirm its validity for circles in two dimensions. Our analysis is complemented by numerical experiments for planar curves, surfaces in three-dimensional space, and semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transport equation with a velocity field satisfying the Osgood condition. The weak formulation is not meaningful in the usual Lebesgue sense, meaning that the usual DiPerna--Lions treatment of the problem is not applicable {(in particular, the divergence of the velocity might be unbounded)}. Instead, we use Riemann--Stieltjes integration to interpret the weak formulation, leading to a well-posedness theory in regimes not covered by existing works. The most general results are for the one-dimensional problem, with generalisations to multiple dimensions in the particular case of log-Lipschitz velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Radiative Vlasov-Maxwell equations model the radiative kinetics of collisionless relativistic plasma. In them the Lorentz force is modified by the addition of radiation reaction forces. The radiation forces produce damping of particle energy but these forces are not divergence-free in momentum space, which has an effect of concentration near zero momentum. We prove unconditional global regularity of solutions for a class of Radiative Vlasov-Maxwell equations with large initial data.</description>

      <title>Morawetz type estimate for damped wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$ and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a Morawetz type etimate for the linear inhomogeneous wave equation with time-dependent scale invariant damping in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$. The novelty is that we view the differential operator $\Box+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_t$ as $n+1+\mu$ dimensional operator, then a well-matched multiplier is introduced. As an application, a sharp global existence result for the small data Cauchy problem of the semilinear wave equation \[ \partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\partial_tu}{t}=|u|^p,~~~t&gt;t_0\geq 0 \] is obtained in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, this assumption results in the "Master equation" (a.k.a. "Monster equation"), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-Norm Bounds for Automorphic Forms via Spectral Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a Hecke-Maass cusp form on the modular surface ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$, namely an $L^2$-normalised nonconstant Laplacian eigenfunction on ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$ that is additionally a joint eigenfunction of every Hecke operator. We prove the $L^4$-norm bound $\|g\|_4\ll_{\varepsilon}\lambda_g^{3/304+\varepsilon}$, where $\lambda_g$ denotes the Laplacian eigenvalue of $g$, which improves upon Sogge's $L^4$-norm bound $\|g\|_4\ll\lambda_g^{1/16}$ for Laplacian eigenfunctions on a compact Riemann surface by more than a six-fold power-saving. Via interpolation, this yields $L^p$-norm bounds for Hecke-Maass cusp forms that are power-saving improvements on Sogge's bounds for all $p&gt;2$. Our paper marks the first improvement of Sogge's result on the modular surface. Furthermore, these methods yield for compact arithmetic surfaces the best $L^4$-norm bound to date.
  Via the Watson-Ichino triple product formula, bounds for the $L^4$-norm of $g$ are reduced to bounds for certain mixed moments of $L$-functions. We bound these using two forms of spectral reciprocity. The first is a form of ${\rm GL}_3\times{\rm GL}_2\leftrightsquigarrow{\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_1$ spectral reciprocity, which relates a ${\rm GL}_2$ moment of ${\rm GL}_3\times{\rm GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions to a ${\rm GL}_1$ moment of ${\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_1$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions; this can be seen as a cuspidal analogue of Motohashi's formula relating the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta function to the third moment of central values of Hecke $L$-functions. The second is a form of ${\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_2\leftrightsquigarrow{\rm GL}_4\times{\rm GL}_2$ spectral reciprocity, which is a cuspidal analogue of a formula of Kuznetsov for the fourth moment of central values of Hecke $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with quasi-local isoperimetric versions of the positive mass theorem on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense. As a corollary, we derive existence results for isoperimetric sets in such low regularity setting. Our main tool is a new local version of the weak inverse mean curvature flow enjoying $C^0$-stable quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>Finite-time horizon, stopper vs. singular-controller games on the half-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable framework for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry \&amp; M.R. Dennis's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f configuration. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO. As the opening chapter in a trilogy, this work connects crystal optics, Fourier optics, and nonlinear optics, while integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental physics, advancing all six domains.</description>
