      <title>Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time horizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures tick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices, and yearly financial data since medieval times.
  Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time scales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a reversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime, weak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of investors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become strong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a return of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we find the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that become statistically significant tend to persist.
  Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of financial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed lattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders, the gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient markets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the lattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a few days, with a correlation time of a few years.</description>

      <title>Considerations on the use of financial ratios in the study of family businesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most empirical works that study the financing decisions of family businesses use financial ratios. These data present asymmetry, non-normality, non-linearity and even dependence on the results of the choice of which accounting figure goes to the numerator and denominator of the ratio. This article uses compositional data analysis (CoDa) as well as classical analysis strategies to compare the structure of balance sheet liabilities between family and non-family businesses, showing the sensitivity of the results to the methodology used. The results prove the need to use appropriate methodologies to advance the academic discipline.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Regime-Switching Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the continuous-time Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio optimization problem, we study a regime-switching market setting and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to assist informed exploration within the control space. We introduce and solve the Exploratory Mean Variance with Regime Switching (EMVRS) problem. We also present a Policy Improvement Theorem. Further, we recognize that the widely applied Temporal Difference (TD) learning is not adequate for the EMVRS context, hence we consider Orthogonality Condition (OC) learning, leveraging the martingale property of the induced optimal value function from the analytical solution to EMVRS. We design a RL algorithm that has more meaningful parameterization using the market parameters and propose an updating scheme for each parameter. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of OC learning over TD learning with a clear convergence of the market parameters towards their corresponding ``grounding true" values in a simulated market scenario. In a real market data study, EMVRS with OC learning outperforms its counterparts with the highest mean and reasonably low volatility of the annualized portfolio returns.</description>

      <title>Generalized Distribution Prediction for Asset Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for predicting the distribution of asset returns using a quantile-based method with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our model is designed in two stages: the first focuses on predicting the quantiles of normalized asset returns using asset-specific features, while the second stage incorporates market data to adjust these predictions for broader economic conditions. This results in a generalized model that can be applied across various asset classes, including commodities, cryptocurrencies, as well as synthetic datasets. The predicted quantiles are then converted into full probability distributions through kernel density estimation, allowing for more precise return distribution predictions and inferencing. The LSTM model significantly outperforms a linear quantile regression baseline by 98% and a dense neural network model by over 50%, showcasing its ability to capture complex patterns in financial return distributions across both synthetic and real-world data. By using exclusively asset-class-neutral features, our model achieves robust, generalizable results.</description>
