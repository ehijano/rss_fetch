      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization for Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems that involve a large number of variables or columns. This technique begins by solving a smaller problem with a subset of columns and gradually generates additional columns as needed. However, the generation of columns often requires solving difficult subproblems repeatedly, which can be a bottleneck for CG. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called machine learning enhanced ant colony optimization (MLACO), to efficiently generate multiple high-quality columns from a subproblem. Specifically, we train a ML model to predict the optimal solution of a subproblem, and then integrate this ML prediction into the probabilistic model of ACO to sample multiple high-quality columns. Our experimental results on the bin packing problem with conflicts show that the MLACO method significantly improves the performance of CG compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when our method is incorporated into a Branch-and-Price method, it leads to a significant reduction in solution time.</description>

      <title>Sign Gradient Descent-based Neuronal Dynamics: ANN-to-SNN Conversion Beyond ReLU Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) is studied in multidisciplinary domains to (i) enable order-of-magnitudes energy-efficient AI inference and (ii) computationally simulate neuro-scientific mechanisms. The lack of discrete theory obstructs the practical application of SNN by limiting its performance and nonlinearity support. We present a new optimization-theoretic perspective of the discrete dynamics of spiking neurons. We prove that a discrete dynamical system of simple integrate-and-fire models approximates the sub-gradient method over unconstrained optimization problems. We practically extend our theory to introduce a novel sign gradient descent (signGD)-based neuronal dynamics that can (i) approximate diverse nonlinearities beyond ReLU and (ii) advance ANN-to-SNN conversion performance in low time steps. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our technique achieves (i) state-of-the-art performance in ANN-to-SNN conversion and (ii) is the first to convert new DNN architectures, e.g., ConvNext, MLP-Mixer, and ResMLP. We publicly share our source code at https://github.com/snuhcs/snn_signgd .</description>

      <title>Optimizing PM2.5 Forecasting Accuracy with Hybrid Meta-Heuristic and Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely alerts about hazardous air pollutants are crucial for public health. However, existing forecasting models often overlook key factors like baseline parameters and missing data, limiting their accuracy. This study introduces a hybrid approach to address these issues, focusing on forecasting hourly PM2.5 concentrations using Support Vector Regression (SVR). Meta-heuristic algorithms, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), optimize SVR Hyper-parameters "C" and "Gamma" to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluation metrics include R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show significant improvements with PSO-SVR (R2: 0.9401, RMSE: 0.2390, MAE: 0.1368) and GWO-SVR (R2: 0.9408, RMSE: 0.2376, MAE: 0.1373), indicating robust and accurate models suitable for similar research applications.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Evolutionary Metaheuristic (GEM) Algorithm for Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many optimization problems in engineering and industrial design applications can be formulated as optimization problems with highly nonlinear objectives, subject to multiple complex constraints. Solving such optimization problems requires sophisticated algorithms and optimization techniques. A major trend in recent years is the use of nature-inspired metaheustic algorithms (NIMA). Despite the popularity of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, there are still some challenging issues and open problems to be resolved. Two main issues related to current NIMAs are: there are over 540 algorithms in the literature, and there is no unified framework to understand the search mechanisms of different algorithms. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyse some similarities and differences among different algorithms and then presents a generalized evolutionary metaheuristic (GEM) in an attempt to unify some of the existing algorithms. After a brief discussion of some insights into nature-inspired algorithms and some open problems, we propose a generalized evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm to unify more than 20 different algorithms so as to understand their main steps and search mechanisms. We then test the unified GEM using 15 test benchmarks to validate its performance. Finally, further research topics are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>MALT Powers Up Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current adversarial attacks for multi-class classifiers choose the target class for a given input naively, based on the classifier's confidence levels for various target classes. We present a novel adversarial targeting method, \textit{MALT - Mesoscopic Almost Linearity Targeting}, based on medium-scale almost linearity assumptions. Our attack wins over the current state of the art AutoAttack on the standard benchmark datasets CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and for a variety of robust models. In particular, our attack is \emph{five times faster} than AutoAttack, while successfully matching all of AutoAttack's successes and attacking additional samples that were previously out of reach. We then prove formally and demonstrate empirically that our targeting method, although inspired by linear predictors, also applies to standard non-linear models.</description>

      <title>Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Greedy and Simulated Annealing Ideas for Vascular Robot Ordering Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive approach for optimizing the acquisition, utilization, and maintenance of ABLVR vascular robots in healthcare settings. Medical robotics, particularly in vascular treatments, necessitates precise resource allocation and optimization due to the complex nature of robot and operator maintenance. Traditional heuristic methods, though intuitive, often fail to achieve global optimization. To address these challenges, this research introduces a novel strategy, combining mathematical modeling, a hybrid genetic algorithm, and ARIMA time series forecasting. Considering the dynamic healthcare environment, our approach includes a robust resource allocation model for robotic vessels and operators. We incorporate the unique requirements of the adaptive learning process for operators and the maintenance needs of robotic components. The hybrid genetic algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and greedy approaches, efficiently solves the optimization problem. Additionally, ARIMA time series forecasting predicts the demand for vascular robots, further enhancing the adaptability of our strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of optimization, transparency, and convergence speed from other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

      <title>Expressivity of Neural Networks with Random Weights and Learned Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landmark universal function approximation results for neural networks with trained weights and biases provided impetus for the ubiquitous use of neural networks as learning models in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and neuroscience. Recent work has pushed the bounds of universal approximation by showing that arbitrary functions can similarly be learned by tuning smaller subsets of parameters, for example the output weights, within randomly initialized networks. Motivated by the fact that biases can be interpreted as biologically plausible mechanisms for adjusting unit outputs in neural networks, such as tonic inputs or activation thresholds, we investigate the expressivity of neural networks with random weights where only biases are optimized. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence demonstrating that feedforward neural networks with fixed random weights can be trained to perform multiple tasks by learning biases only. We further show that an equivalent result holds for recurrent neural networks predicting dynamical system trajectories. Our results are relevant to neuroscience, where they demonstrate the potential for behaviourally relevant changes in dynamics without modifying synaptic weights, as well as for AI, where they shed light on multi-task methods such as bias fine-tuning and unit masking.</description>

      <title>Task-Synchronized Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.05192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data are often sampled irregularly in time. Dealing with this using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) traditionally involved ignoring the fact, feeding the time differences as additional inputs, or resampling the data. All these methods have their shortcomings. We propose an elegant straightforward alternative approach where instead the RNN is in effect resampled in time to match the time of the data or the task at hand. We use Echo State Network (ESN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as the basis for our solution. Such RNNs can be seen as discretizations of continuous-time dynamical systems, which gives a solid theoretical ground to our approach. Our Task-Synchronized ESN (TSESN) and GRU (TSGRU) models allow for a direct model time setting and require no additional training, parameter tuning, or computation (solving differential equations or interpolating data) compared to their regular counterparts, thus retaining their original efficiency. We confirm empirically that our models can effectively compensate for the time-non-uniformity of the data and demonstrate that they compare favorably to data resampling, classical RNN methods, and alternative RNN models proposed to deal with time irregularities on several real-world nonuniform-time datasets. We open-source the code at https://github.com/oshapio/task-synchronized-RNNs .</description>
