      <title>Predicting Survivability of Cancer Patients with Metastatic Patterns Using Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer remains a leading global health challenge and a major cause of mortality. This study leverages machine learning (ML) to predict the survivability of cancer patients with metastatic patterns using the comprehensive MSK-MET dataset, which includes genomic and clinical data from 25,775 patients across 27 cancer types. We evaluated five ML models-XGBoost, Na\"ive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Fores using hyperparameter tuning and grid search. XGBoost emerged as the best performer with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. To enhance model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied, revealing key predictors such as metastatic site count, tumor mutation burden, fraction of genome altered, and organ-specific metastases. Further survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox Proportional Hazards models, and XGBoost Survival Analysis identified significant predictors of patient outcomes, offering actionable insights for clinicians. These findings could aid in personalized prognosis and treatment planning, ultimately improving patient care.</description>

      <title>DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over the baseline method. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 17.64%, 27.15%, and 18.07% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.</description>

      <title>Mass Balance Approximation of Unfolding Improves Potential-Like Methods for Protein Stability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations plays a pivotal role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug discovery, enzyme reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although deep-learning strategies have pushed the field forward, their use in standard workflows remains limited due to resource demands. Conversely, potential-like methods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically estimate Gibbs free energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the unfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish accuracy. This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC) to account for the unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While many machine learning models partially model this balance, our analysis suggests that a refined representation of the unfolded state may improve the predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Height Prediction Using Large-Scale Longitudinal Body Composition Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed an accurate artificial intelligence model for predicting future height in children and adolescents using anthropometric and body composition data from the GP Cohort Study (588,546 measurements from 96,485 children aged 7-18). The model incorporated anthropometric measures, body composition, standard deviation scores, and growth velocity parameters, with performance evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results showed high accuracy with males achieving average RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of 2.51 cm, 1.74 cm, and 1.14%, and females showing 2.28 cm, 1.68 cm, and 1.13%, respectively. Explainable AI approaches identified height SDS, height velocity, and soft lean mass velocity as crucial predictors. The model generated personalized growth curves by estimating individual-specific height trajectories, offering a robust tool for clinical decision support, early identification of growth disorders, and optimization of growth outcomes.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Replace Data Scientists in Biomedical Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in biomedical research, but it requires professionals with expertise in coding and medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks and performing well in general coding tests. However, existing evaluations fail to assess their capability in biomedical data science, particularly in handling diverse data types such as genomics and clinical datasets. To address this gap, we developed a benchmark of data science coding tasks derived from the analyses of 39 published studies. This benchmark comprises 293 coding tasks (128 in Python and 165 in R) performed on real-world TCGA-type genomics and clinical data. Our findings reveal that the vanilla prompting of LLMs yields suboptimal performances due to drawbacks in following input instructions, understanding target data, and adhering to standard analysis practices. Next, we benchmarked six cutting-edge LLMs and advanced adaptation methods, finding two methods to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 21% code accuracy improvement (56.6% versus 35.3%); and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to refine the buggy code iteratively, yielding an 11% code accuracy improvement (45.5% versus 34.3%). Building on these insights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical professionals, we found that while LLMs cannot fully automate programming tasks, they significantly streamline the programming process. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated from LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance data science efficiency in biomedical research when integrated into expert workflows.</description>
