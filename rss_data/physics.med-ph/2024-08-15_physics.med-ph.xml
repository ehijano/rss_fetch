      <title>A Monte Carlo assessment of the spectral performance of four types of photon counting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous publications, we have presented an alternative approach to determine essential detector properties like the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), the Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) and the Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) based on a Monte Carlo model of the detection process. If a Monte Carlo model for the detector response to photons impinging at various locations of a pixel is available, the full statistics of the detector can be derived in a straightforward manner. The purpose of this paper is to describe the method in detail and to apply it to four types of realistic detectors: direct converting detectors using CdTe and silicon, a CdTe photon counter with additional coincidence counters and an optical counting system using LaBr3 as scintillator.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>

Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant carbon ion beam energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and carbon ion beam energy such that the kinetic energy of the carbon ions in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the carbon ion kinetic energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 2: Detailed radiation transport and track structure simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously reported nanodosimetric measurements of therapeutic-energy carbon ions penetrating simulated tissue have produced results that are incompatible with the predicted mean energy of the carbon ions in the nanodosimeter and previous experiments with lower energy monoenergetic beams. The purpose of this study is to explore the origin of these discrepancies. Detailed simulations using the Geant4 toolkit were performed to investigate the radiation field in the nanodosimeter and provide input data for track structure simulations, which were performed with a developed version of the PTra code. The Geant4 simulations show that with the narrow-beam geometry employed in the experiment, only a small fraction of the carbon ions traverse the nanodosimeter and their mean energy is between 12 % and 30 % lower than the targeted values. Only about one-third or less of these carbon ions hit the trigger detector. The track structure simulations indicate that the observed enhanced ionization cluster sizes are mainly due to coincidences with events in which carbon ions miss the trigger detector. In addition, the discrepancies observed for high absorber thicknesses of carbon ions traversing the target volume could be explained by assuming an increase in thickness or interaction cross-sections in the order of 1 %. The results show that even with strong collimation of the radiation field, future nanodosimetric measurements of clinical carbon ion beams will require large trigger detectors to register all events with carbon ions traversing the nanodosimeter. Energy loss calculations of the primary beam in the absorbers are insufficient and should be replaced by detailed simulations when planning such experiments. Uncertainties of the interaction cross-sections in simulation codes may shift the Bragg peak position.</description>
