      <title>Eigenvalue conditions implying edge-disjoint spanning trees and a forest with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial graph with minimum degree $\delta$ and $k$ an integer with $k\ge 2$. In the literature, there are eigenvalue conditions that imply $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees. We give eigenvalue conditions that imply $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees and another forest $F$ with $|E(F)|&gt;\frac{\delta-1}{\delta}(|V(G)|-1)$, and if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $\delta$ edges.</description>

      <title>Independent transversal blow-up of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an $r$-partite graph, an independent transversal of size $s$ (ITS) consists of $s$ vertices from each part forming an independent set. Motivated by a question from Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'edi (1975), Di Braccio and Illingworth (2024) inquired about the minimum degree needed to ensure an $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph contains $K_r(s)$, a complete $r$-partite graph with $s$ vertices in each part. We reformulate this as finding the smallest $n$ such that any $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ has an ITS. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove the existence of a $\gamma&gt;0$ ensuring that if $G$ is a multipartite graph partitioned as $(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_r)$, where the average degree of each part $V_i$ is at most $D$, the maximum degree of any vertex to any part $V_i$ is at most $\gamma D$, and the size of each part $V_i$ is at least $(s + \varepsilon)D$, then $G$ possesses an ITS. The constraint $(s + \varepsilon)D$ on the part size is tight. This extends results of Loh and Sudakov (2007), Glock and Sudakov (2022), and Kang and Kelly (2022). We also show that any $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph with minimum degree at least $\left(r-1-\frac{1}{2s^2}\right)n$ contains $K_r(s)$ and provide a relative Tur\'an-type result. Additionally, this paper explores counting ITSs in multipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>On weak cop numbers of transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak cop number of infinite graphs can be seen as a coarse-geometric analogue to the cop number of finite graphs. We show that every vertex transitive graph with at least one thick end has infinite weak cop number. It follows that every connected, vertex transitive graph has weak cop number $1$ or $\infty$, answering a question posed by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and reiterated in recent preprints by Appenzeller and Klinge, and by Esperet, Gahlawat, and Giocanti.</description>

      <title>New recursion formula for the interior polynomial based on non-expanding sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interior polynomial was originally defined for hypergraphs and later shown to coincide with the Ehrhart polynomial of the root polytope of an associated bipartite graph. In previous work, we derived an alternating cycle recursion formula for the interior polynomial. Here, we introduce a new, more transparent recursion formula based on the structure of non-expanding sets. This formula offers a clearer combinatorial interpretation of the interior polynomial and its connection to polyhedral geometry.</description>

      <title>Disjoint $X$-paths in bidirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a bidirected multigraph with signing $\sigma$, let $X$ be a set of vertices in $B$, and let $k$ be a non-negative integer. For any pair of vertex sets $S,T\subset V(B)$ satisfying $X\cap S = X\cap T$, we denote by $B_{S,T}$ the multigraph with the same vertex set as $B$ and with edge set consisting of those edges $e$ of $B$ each of whose endvertices $v$ satisfies $v\notin S\cup T$ or $v\in S\setminus T$, $\sigma(v,e)=-$ or $v\in T\setminus S$, $\sigma(v,e)=+$. We prove that $B$ admits a set of $k$ pairwise disjoint $X$-paths if and only if for any $S,T\subseteq V(B)$ with $X\cap S = X\cap T$, the inequality $\left\lvert S\cap T \right\rvert +\sum \lfloor \tfrac{1}{2} \left\lvert V(C)\cap (X\cup S\cup T) \right\rvert \rfloor \geq k$ holds where the sum is indexed by the components of $B_{S,T}$. This result is a generalization of a result of Gallai from undirected graphs to bidirected ones. Furthermore, we will deduce from this a kind of an Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for $X$-paths in bidirected multigraphs.</description>

      <title>Digital Convexity and Combinatorics on Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An upward (resp.~downward) digitally convex word is a binary word that best approximates from below (resp.~from above) an upward (resp.~downward) convex curve in the plane. We study these words from the combinatorial point of view, formalizing their geometrical properties and highlighting connections with Christoffel words and finite Sturmian words. In particular, we study from the combinatorial perspective the operations of inflation and deflation on digitally convex words.</description>

      <title>The polytope of all matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible to write the indicator function of any matroid polytope as an integer combination of indicator functions of Schubert matroid polytopes. In this way, every matroid on $n$ elements of rank $r$ can be thought of as a lattice point in the space having a coordinate for each Schubert matroid on $n$ elements of rank $r$.
  We study the convex hull of all these lattice points, with particular focus on the vertices, which come from the matroids we call extremal matroids. We show that several famous classes of matroids arise as faces of the polytopes, and in many cases we determine the dimension of this face explicitly. As an application, we show that there exist valuative invariants that attain non-negative values at all representable matroids, but fail to be non-negative in general.</description>

      <title>On coarse tree decompositions and coarse balanced separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its balanced separator number: the smallest integer $k$ such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.
  As the first result, we prove that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits balanced separators coverable by $k$ balls of radius $r$, then $G$ also admits tree decompositions ${\cal T}_1$ and ${\cal T}_2$ such that:
  - in ${\cal T}_1$, every bag can be covered by $O(k\log n)$ balls of radius $r$; and
  - in ${\cal T}_2$, every bag can be covered by $O(k^2\log k)$ balls of radius $r(\log k+\log\log n+O(1))$.
  As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that $G$ has doubling dimension at most $m$, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting. Precisely, we prove that for a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ of doubling dimension at most $m$, the following conditions are equivalent, with constants $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,\Delta_3,\Delta_4$ depending on each other and on $m$:
  - $G$ admits balanced separators consisting of $k_1$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree decomposition with bags coverable by $k_2$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree-partition of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_3$ with bags coverable by $k_3$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ is quasi-isometric to a graph of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_4$ and tree-partition width $\leq k_4$.</description>

      <title>Nut graphs with a prescribed number of vertex and edge orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a nontrivial graph whose adjacency matrix has a one-dimensional null space spanned by a vector without zero entries. Recently, it was shown that a nut graph has more edge orbits than vertex orbits. It was also shown that for any even $r \ge 2$ and any $k \ge r + 1$, there exist infinitely many nut graphs with $r$ vertex orbits and $k$ edge orbits. Here, we extend this result by finding all the pairs $(r, k)$ for which there exists a nut graph with $r$ vertex orbits and $k$ edge orbits. In particular, we show that for any $k \ge 2$, there are infinitely many Cayley nut graphs with $k$ edge orbits and $k$ arc orbits.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric results about graph homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many important results in extremal graph theory can be roughly summarised as "if a triangle-free graph $G$ has certain properties, then it has a homomorphism to a triangle-free graph $\Gamma$ of bounded size". For example, bounds on homomorphism thresholds give such a statement if $G$ has sufficiently high minimum degree, and the approximate homomorphism theorem gives such a statement for all $G$, if one weakens the notion of homomorphism appropriately.
  In this paper, we study asymmetric versions of these results, where the assumptions on $G$ and $\Gamma$ need not match. For example, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with odd girth at least $9$ and minimum degree at least $\delta |G|$, then $G$ is homomorphic to a triangle-free graph whose size depends only on $\delta$. Moreover, the odd girth assumption can be weakened to odd girth at least $7$ if $G$ has bounded VC dimension or bounded domination number. This gives a new and improved proof of a result of Huang et al.
  We also prove that in the asymmetric approximate homomorphism theorem, the bounds exhibit a rather surprising ``double phase transition'': the bounds are super-exponential if $G$ is only assumed to be triangle-free, they become exponential if $G$ is assumed to have odd girth $7$ or $9$, and become linear if $G$ has odd girth at least $11$.
  Our proofs use a wide variety of techniques, including entropy arguments, the Frieze--Kannan weak regularity lemma, properties of the generalised Mycielskian construction, and recent work on abundance and the asymmetric removal lemma.</description>

      <title>A recursion formula for Branching from $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any representation of a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, one problem of branching rules to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-subalgebra is to determine the multiplicity of each irreducible component. In this paper, we derive a recursion formula of such multiplicities by restricting a certain tensor representation in two ways, in which the Pieri's rule is involved. We also investigate branching rules for fundamental representations as they are initial conditions of the recursion formula.</description>

      <title>$K$-type multiplicities in degenerate principal series via Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be one of the complex classical groups ${\rm O}_k$, ${\rm GL}_k$, or ${\rm Sp}_{2k}$. Let $M \subseteq K$ be the block diagonal embedding ${\rm O}_{k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm O}_{k_r}$ or ${\rm GL}_{k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm GL}_{k_r}$ or ${\rm Sp}_{2k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm Sp}_{2k_r}$, respectively. By using Howe duality and seesaw reciprocity as a unified conceptual framework, we prove a formula for the branching multiplicities from $K$ to $M$ which is expressed as a sum of generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, valid within a certain stable range. By viewing $K$ as the complexification of the maximal compact subgroup $K_{\mathbb{R}}$ of the real group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = {\rm GL}(k,\mathbb{R})$, ${\rm GL}(k, \mathbb{C})$, or ${\rm GL}(k,\mathbb{H})$, respectively, one can interpret our branching multiplicities as $K_{\mathbb{R}}$-type multiplicities in degenerate principal series representations of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. Upon specializing to the minimal $M$, where $k_1 = \cdots = k_r = 1$, we establish a fully general tableau-theoretic interpretation of the branching multiplicities, corresponding to the $K_{\mathbb{R}}$-type multiplicities in the principal series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k,s$, we give a conjectural formula for the number $T(n,k,s)$ of order $k$ subsets of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose sum of elements is $s$ modulo $n$. To do so, we describe explicitly a sequence of matrices $M(k)$, for positive integers $k$, such that the size of $M(k)$ is the number of divisors of $k$, and for two coprime integers $k_{1},k_{2}$, the matrix $M(k_{1}k_{2})$ is the Kronecker product of $M(k_{1})$ and $M(k_{2})$. For $s=0, 1, 2$, and for $s=k/2$ when $k$ is even, the sequences $T(n,k,s)$ are related to the number of necklaces with $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads, and to Lyndon words. The conjecture has been tested against computations of $M(k)$ up to $k=10000$.</description>

      <title>Permuton limits for some permutations avoiding a single pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the smallest possible distance between two disjoint lattice polytopes contained in the cube $[0,k]^3$ is exactly $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(2k^2-4k+5)(2k^2-2k+1)}} $$ for every integer $k$ at least $4$. The proof relies on modeling this as a minimization problem over a subset of the lattice points in the hypercube $[-k,k]^9$. A precise characterization of this subset allows to reduce the problem to computing the roots of a finite number of degree at most $4$ polynomials, which is done using symbolic computation.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Frobenius subalgebra lattices within tensor categories and extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors to this setting, under certain positivity conditions encompassing the pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.</description>

      <title>Symbolic powers of polymatroidal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the componentwise linearity and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of symbolic powers of polymatroidal ideals. For a polymatroidal ideal $I$, we conjecture that every symbolic power $I^{(k)}$ is componentwise linear and $$ \text{reg}\,I^{(k)}=\text{reg}\,I^k $$ for all $k \ge 1$. We prove that $\text{reg}\,I^{(k)}\ge\text{reg}\,I^k$ for all $k \ge 1$ when $I$ has no embedded associated primes, for instance if $I$ is a matroidal ideal. Moreover, we establish a criterion on the symbolic Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}_s(I)$ of a monomial ideal of minimal intersection type which guarantees that every symbolic power $I^{(k)}$ has linear quotients and, hence, is componentwise linear for all $k\ge1$. By applying our criterion to squarefree Veronese ideals and certain matching-matroidal ideals, we verify both conjectures for these families. We establish the Conforti-Cornu\'ejols conjecture for any matroidal ideal, and we show that a matroidal ideal is packed if and only if it is the product of monomial prime ideals with pairwise disjoint supports. Furthermore, we identify several classes of non-squarefree polymatroidal ideals for which the ordinary and symbolic powers coincide. Hence, we confirm our conjectures for transversal polymatroidal ideals and principal Borel ideals. Finally, we verify our conjectures for all polymatroidal ideals either generated in small degrees or in a small number of variables.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Covering Colored Mixed Multigraphs with Simple Degree Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of graph covers (also referred to as locally bijective homomorphisms) plays an important role in topological graph theory and has found its computer science applications in models of local computation. For a fixed target graph $H$, the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem asks if an input graph $G$ allows a graph covering projection onto $H$. Despite the fact that the quest for characterizing the computational complexity of {\sc $H$-Cover} had been started more than 30 years ago, only a handful of general results have been known so far.
  In this paper, we present a complete characterization of the computational complexity of covering coloured graphs for the case that every equivalence class in the degree partition of the target graph has at most two vertices. We prove this result in a very general form. Following the lines of current development of topological graph theory, we study graphs in the most relaxed sense of the definition. In particular, we consider graphs that are mixed (they may have both directed and undirected edges), may have multiple edges, loops, and semi-edges. We show that a strong P/NP-complete dichotomy holds true in the sense that for each such fixed target graph $H$, the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem is either polynomial-time solvable for arbitrary inputs, or NP-complete even for simple input graphs.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>

      <title>Solving Maker-Breaker Games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, \mathcal{F})$ be a hypergraph. The Maker-Breaker game on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is a combinatorial game between two players, Maker and Breaker. Beginning with Maker, the players take turns claiming vertices from $X$ that have not yet been claimed. Maker wins if she manages to claim all vertices of some hyperedge $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Breaker wins if he claims at least one vertex in every hyperedge.
  M. L. Rahman and Thomas Watson proved in 2021 that, even when only Maker-Breaker games on 6-uniform hypergraphs are considered, the decision problem of determining which player has a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. They also showed that the problem is NL-hard when considering hypergraphs of rank 5.
  In this paper, we improve the latter result by showing that deciding who wins Maker-Breaker games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is still a PSPACE-complete problem. We achieve this by polynomial transformation from the problem of solving the generalized geography game on bipartite digraphs with vertex degrees 3 or less, which is known to be PSPACE-complete.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes which first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor. These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-product of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and for which the distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$ code, for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</description>

Abstract: DP-coloring was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle as a generalization of list coloring and signed coloring. A new coloring, strictly $f$-degenerate transversal, is a further generalization of DP-coloring and $L$-forested-coloring. In this paper, we present some structural results on planar and toroidal graphs with forbidden configurations, and establish some sufficient conditions for the existence of strictly $f$-degenerate transversal based on these structural results. Consequently, (i) every toroidal graph without subgraphs isomorphic to the configurations in Fig.2 is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$, (ii) every toroidal graph without $4$-cycles is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$, (iii) every planar graph without subgraphs isomorphic to the configurations in Fig.3 is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$. These results improve upon previous results on DP-$4$-coloring [Discrete Math. 341~(7) (2018) 1983--1986; Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. 43~(3) (2020) 2271--2285] and (list) vertex arboricity [Discrete Math. 333 (2014) 101--105; Int. J. Math. Stat. 16~(1) (2015) 97--105; Iranian Math. Soc. 42~(5) (2016) 1293--1303].</description>

Abstract: Given a fixed graph $H$ and an $n$-vertex graph $G$, the $H$-bootstrap percolation process on $G$ is defined to be the sequence of graphs $G_i$, $i\geq 0$ which starts with $G_0:=G$ and in which $G_{i+1}$ is obtained from $G_i$ by adding every edge that completes a copy of $H$. We are interested in $M_H(n)$ which is the maximum number of steps, over all $n$-vertex graphs $G$, that this process takes to stabilise. We determine this maximum running time precisely when $H$ is a cycle, giving the first infinite family of graphs $H$ for which an exact solution is known. We find that $M_{C_k}(n)$ is of order $\log_{k-1}(n)$ for all $3\leq k\in \mathbb{N}$. Interestingly though, the function exhibits different behaviour depending on the parity of $k$ and the exact location of the values of $n$ for which $M_H(n)$ increases is determined by the Frobenius number of a certain numerical semigroup depending on $k$.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams for Multiparameter Filtrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion $\mathsf{OI}$, a concept analogous to M\"obius inversion on finite posets, which is applicable to order-preservings functions from a finite poset to the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(V)$ of an inner product space $V$. This notion critically relies on the inner product structure on $V$ enabling it to capture much finer information than standard integer-valued persistence diagrams.
  Orthogonal Inversion is a special case of the broader concept of Orthomodular Inversion, where the target space is any orthomodular lattice, which we also identify.
  We apply Orthogonal Inversion in order to construct a "non-negative" persistence diagram for any given multiparameter filtration $\mathsf{F}$ of a finite simplicial complex $K$, indexed over an arbitrary finite poset $P$. This is done by applying it to the birth-death spaces of $\mathsf{F}$. Analogously to $1$-parameter classical persistence diagrams, these multiparameter Grassmannian persistence diagrams offer straightforward interpretability. Specifically, to a segment $(b, d) \in \mathsf{Seg}(P)$, (1) the Grassmannian persistence diagram canonically assigns a vector subspace of $C_{\rho}^K$ consisting of cycles that are born at $b$ and become boundaries at $d$ and (2) this assignment is exhaustive at the homology level.
  Finally, we relate our Grassmannian persistence diagrams to the recently introduced notion of M\"obius homology, thus enhancing its interpretability through the lens of our framework.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero set of polynomials built from partition statistics, complementing earlier work in this direction by Boyer, Goh, Parry, and others. In particular, addressing a question of Males with two of the authors, we prove asymptotics for the values of $t$-hook polynomials away from an annulus and isolated zeros of a theta function. We also discuss some open problems and present data on other polynomial families, including those associated to deformations of Rogers--Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>(Injective) hom-complexity between graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the notion of hom-complexity, $\text{C}(G;H)$, for two graphs $G$ and $H$, along with basic results for this numerical invariant. This invariant $\text{C}(G;H)$ is a number that measures the \aspas{complexity} of the question: when is there a homomorphism $G\to H$? More precisely, $\text{C}(G;H)$ is the least number $\ell$ such that there are $\ell$ different subgraphs $G_j$ of $G$ such that $G=G_1\cup\cdots\cup G_\ell$, and for each $G_j$, there is a homomorphism $G_j\to H$. Likewise, we introduce the notion of injective hom-complexity, $\text{IC}(G;H)$. The (injective) hom-complexity is a graph invariant. Additionally, these invariants provide an obstruction to the existence of homomorphisms. We explore the sub-additivity of (injective) hom-complexity and study products.
  We establish a relation between $\text{C}(G;H)$ and the chromatic numbers $\chi(G)$ and $\chi(H)$. Specifically, we present lower and upper bounds for the hom-complexity in terms of the chromatic number and the clique number. We provide the formula $\text{C}(G;H)=\lceil\log_{\chi(H)}\chi(G)\rceil$ whenever $\omega(H)=\chi(H)$. For example, we obtain $\text{C}(G;K_n)=\lceil\log_{n}\chi(G)\rceil$. We also demonstrate a triangular inequality for (injective) hom-complexity. Moreover, we discuss a connection between the (injective) hom-complexity and several well-known covering numbers. For instance, we provide a lower bound for the clique covering number in terms of the injective hom-complexity. Additionally, we show that the hom-complexity $\mathrm{C}(G;K_{\ell})$ coincides with the $\ell$-particity of $G$, and the hom-complexity $\mathrm{C}(K_n;K_{2})$ coincides with the bipartite dimension of $K_n$. As a consequence, we recover the well-known formulas $\beta_\ell(G)=\lceil\log_{\ell}\chi(G)\rceil$ and $\mathrm{d}(K_n)=\lceil\log_{2}n\rceil$.</description>

      <title>Partitions of an Eulerian Digraph into Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a cancellation property satisfied by a connected Eulerian digraph $D$. Namely, unless $D$ is a single directed cycle, we have $\sum_{k\geq 1} (-1)^{k} f_k(D)=0$, where $f_k(D)$ is the number of partitions of Eulerian circuits of $D$ into $k$ circuits. This property is a consequence of the fact that the Martin polynomial of a digraph has no constant term. We provide an alternative proof by employing Viennot's theory of Heaps of Pieces, and in particular, a bijection between closed trails of a digraph and heaps with a unique maximal piece, which are also in bijection with unique sink orientations of the intersection graphs $G_a$ of partitions $a$ of $E(D)$ into cycles. The argument considers the partition lattice of the edge set of a digraph $D$, restricted to the join-semilattice $T(D)$ induced by elements whose blocks are connected and Eulerian. The minimal elements of $T(D)$ are exactly the partitions of $D$ into cycles, and the up-set of a minimal element $a\in T(D)$ is shown to be isomorphic to the bond lattice $L(G_a)$. Using tools developed by Whitney and Rota, we perform M\"{o}bius inversion on $T(D)$ and obtain the claimed cancellation.
  As a consequence of this alternative proof, we relate the Martin polynomial of a digraph directly to the chromatic polynomials of the intersection graphs of partitions of $D$ into cycles. Finally, we apply the cancellation property in order to deduce the classical Harary-Sachs Theorem for graphs of rank $2$ from a hypergraph generalization thereof, remedying a gap in a previous proof of this.</description>

      <title>Alternative set-theoretical algorithms for efficient computations of cliques in Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying cliques in dense networks remains a formidable challenge, even with significant advances in computational power and methodologies. To tackle this, numerous algorithms have been developed to optimize time and memory usage, implemented across diverse programming languages. Yet, the inherent NP-completeness of the problem continues to hinder performance on large-scale networks, often resulting in memory leaks and slow computations. In the present study, we critically evaluate classic algorithms to pinpoint computational bottlenecks and introduce novel set-theoretical approaches tailored for network clique computation. Our proposed algorithms are rigorously implemented and benchmarked against existing Python-based solutions, demonstrating superior performance. These findings underscore the potential of set-theoretical techniques to drive substantial performance gains in network analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $(1+o(1))\sqrt{e/n}$ is the sharp threshold for the appearance of the square of a Hamilton cycle in $G(n,p)$, confirming the conjecture of Kahn, Narayanan, and Park. We also find the exact asymptotics of the threshold for the emergence of a spanning subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph $F$ for a wide family of $d$-regular graphs $F$. This family includes almost all $d$-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Cluster categories for completed infinity-gons I: Categorifying triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m recently introduced triangulated categories of arcs in completed infinity-gons, which are discs with an infinite closed set of marked points on their boundary. These categories have many features in common with the cluster categories associated to discs with different sets of marked points. In particular, they have (weak) cluster-tilting subcategories, which Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m show are in bijection with very special triangulations of the disc. This is in contrast to Igusa and Todorov's earlier work in the uncompleted case, in which every triangulation corresponds to a weak cluster-tilting subcategory.
  In this paper, we replace the triangulated structure of Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m's category by an extriangulated substructure and prove that, with this structure, the weak cluster-tilting subcategories are once again in bijection with triangulations. We further show that functorial finiteness of a weak cluster-tilting subcategory is equivalent to a very mild condition on the triangulation, which also appears in \c{C}anak\c{c}{\i} and Felikson's study of infinite rank cluster algebras from Teichm\"uller theory. By comparison with the combinatorics of triangulations, we are also able to characterise when weak cluster-tilting subcategories can be mutated in this new extriangulated category.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is a known $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Measures associated with certain ellipsephic harmonic series and the Allouche-Hu-Morin limit theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the harmonic series $S(k)=\sum^{(k)} m^{-1}$ over the integers having $k$ occurrences of a given block of $b$-ary digits, of length $p$, and relate them to certain measures on the interval $[0,1)$. We show that these measures converge weakly to $b^p$ times the Lebesgue measure, a fact which allows a new proof of the theorem of Allouche, Hu, and Morin which says $\lim S(k)=b^p\log(b)$. A quantitative error estimate will be given. Combinatorial aspects involve generating series which fall under the scope of the Goulden-Jackson cluster generating function formalism and the work of Guibas-Odlyzko on string overlaps.</description>

      <title>Coloring bridge-free antiprismatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coloring problem is a well-research topic and its complexity is known for several classes of graphs. However, the question of its complexity remains open for the class of antiprismatic graphs, which are the complement of prismatic graphs and one of the four remaining cases highlighted by Lozin and Malishev. In this article we focus on the equivalent question of the complexity of the clique cover problem in prismatic graphs.
  A graph $G$ is prismatic if for every triangle $T$ of $G$, every vertex of $G$ not in $T$ has a unique neighbor in $T$. A graph is co-bridge-free if it has no $C_4+2K_1$ as induced subgraph. We give a polynomial time algorithm that solves the clique cover problem in co-bridge-free prismatic graphs. It relies on the structural description given by Chudnovsky and Seymour, and on later work of Preissmann, Robin and Trotignon.
  We show that co-bridge-free prismatic graphs have a bounded number of disjoint triangles and that implies that the algorithm presented by Preissmann et al. applies.</description>

      <title>Higher level $q$-multiple zeta values with applications to quasimodular forms and partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the generalized sum-of-divisor functions of MacMahon have been unified into the algebraic framework of $q$-multiple zeta values. In particular, these results link partition theory, quasimodular forms, $q$-multiple zeta values, and quasi-shuffle algebras. In this paper, we complete this idea of unification for higher levels, demonstrating that any quasimodular form of weight $k \geq 2$ and level $N$ may be expressed in terms of the $q$-multiple zeta values of level $N$ studied algebraically by Yuan and Zhao. We also give results restricted to $q$-multiple zeta values with integer coefficients, and we construct completely additive generating sets for spaces of quasimodular forms and for quasimodular forms with integer coefficients. We also provide a variety of computational examples from number-theoretic perspectives that suggest many new applications of the algebraic structure of $q$-multiple zeta values to quasimodular forms and partitions.</description>

      <title>Precision Asymptotics for Partitions Featuring False-Indefinite Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andrews-Dyson-Hickerson, Cohen build a striking relation between q-hypergeometric series, real quadratic fields, and Maass forms. Thanks to the works of Lewis-Zagier and Zwegers we have a complete understanding on the part of these relations pertaining to Maass forms and false-indefinite theta functions. In particular, we can systematically distinguish and study the class of false-indefinite theta functions related to Maass forms. A crucial component here is the framework of mock Maass theta functions built by Zwegers in analogy with his earlier work on indefinite theta functions and their application to Ramanujan's mock theta functions. Given this understanding, a natural question is to what extent one can utilize modular properties to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the associated Fourier coefficients, especially in view of their relevance to combinatorial objects. In this paper, we develop the relevant methods to study such a question and show that quite detailed results can be obtained on the asymptotic development, which also enable Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher type exact formulas under the right conditions. We develop these techniques by concentrating on a concrete example involving partitions with parts separated by parity and derive an asymptotic expansion that includes all the exponentially growing terms.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>
