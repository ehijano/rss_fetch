      <title>Coupled Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) Equations for two interacting electrostatic wavepackets in a non-Maxwellian fluid plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of two co-propagating electrostatic wavepackets, characterized by different wavenumbers and amplitudes, in a 1D non-magnetized plasma fluid model is considered, from first principles. The original plasma model, consisting of \kappa-distributed electrons evolving against a cold ion background, is reduced, by means of a multiple-scale perturbation method to a pair of asymmetric coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations for the dynamics of the wavepacket envelopes.
  Exact analytical expressions are derived for the dispersion, self-modulation, and cross-modulation coefficients involved in the CNLS equations, as functions of the wavenumbers and the spectral index \kappa characterizing the electron profile. An analytical investigation of the modulational instability (MI) properties of this pair of wavepackets reveals that MI occurs in most parts of the parameter space.
  The instability windows and the corresponding growth rate are calculated in a number of case studies. Two-wave interaction favors MI by extending its range of occurrence and by enhancing its growth rate. Growth rate patterns obtained for different \kappa suggest that deviation from Maxwellian equilibrium, for low \kappa values, leads to enhanced MI of the interacting wave pair.
  To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of two co-propagating wavepackets in a plasma described by a fluid model with \kappa-distributed electrons is investigated thoroughly with respect to their MI properties as a function of \kappa for the first time, in the framework of an asymmetric CNLS system. Although we have focused on electrostatic wavepacket propagation in non-Maxwellian plasma, the results are generic and may be used as basis to model energy localization in nonlinear optics, in hydrodynamics or in dispersive media with Kerr-type nonlinearities where MI is relevant.</description>

      <title>On the Heating of the Slow Solar-Wind by Imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave Turbulence from 0.06 au to 1 au: Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter observations</title>

Abstract: In this work we analyze plasma and magnetic field data provided by the Parker Solar Probe (\emph{PSP}) and Solar Orbiter (\emph{SO}) missions to investigate the radial evolution of the heating of Alfv\'enic slow wind (ASW) by imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave (AW) turbulent fluctuations from 0.06 au to 1 au. in our analysis we focus on slow solar-wind intervals with highly imbalanced and incompressible turbulence (i.e., magnetic compressibility $C_B=\delta B/B\leq 0.25$, plasma compressibility $C_n=\delta n/n\leq 0.25$ and normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c\geq 0.65$). First, we estimate the AW turbulent dissipation rate from the wave energy equation and find that the radial profile trend is similar to the proton heating rate. Second, we find that the scaling of the empirical AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_W$ obtained from the wave energy equation matches the scaling from the phenomenological AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_{\rm CH09}$ (with $Q_{\rm CH09}\simeq 1.55 Q_W$) derived by~\cite{chandran09} based on the model of reflection-driven turbulence. Our results suggest that, as in the fast solar wind, AW turbulence plays a major role in the ion heating that occurs in incompressible slow-wind streams.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Non-equilibrium Electron Effects on the Collisional Ionization Rate in the Collisional-Radiative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of kinetic electron physics and atomic processes in ultrashort laser-plasma interactions provides a comprehensive understanding of electron energy distribution's impact on plasma properties. Notably, non-equilibrium electrons play a vital role in collisional ionization, influencing ionization degrees and spectra. This paper introduces a computational model that integrates the physics of kinetic electrons and atomic processes, utilizing a Boltzmann equation for non-equilibrium electrons and a collisional-radiative model for atomic state populations. The model is used to investigate the influence of non-equilibrium electrons on collisional ionization rates and their effect on population distribution, as demonstrated by L. Young et al. (Nature, 2010). The study reveals significant non-equilibrium electron presence during XFEL-matter interactions, profoundly affecting collisional ionization rates in the gas plasma, thereby necessitating careful consideration of the Collisional-Radiative (CR) model applied to such systems.</description>
