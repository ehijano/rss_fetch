      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of life is a frequency distribution conversion process of molecules accompanied by changes in information. In wet-dry cycling hot springs, RNA of different sequences continuously undergoes polymerization and decomposition reactions, products with stable configurations will accumulate their frequency among all RNA molecules and finally become an important source of DNA coding and non-coding regions in primitive cells. This periodic extreme environmental change narrows the frequency distribution of macromolecules through the distillation process and new potential catalysts are searched. When enough macromolecules are accumulated and reliable reaction pathways are built, phospholipids randomly wrap the macromolecules in the hot springs which I would call it the pioneer pools, and these protocells become parallel calculators of molecule frequency distribution. Through the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different molecular weights and properties, cells with appropriate distribution have more opportunities to absorb small molecule substances and increase its intracellular frequencies of molecules. This will strongly induce the occurrence of macromolecules that can widely catalyze the synthesis of other macromolecules or themselves, such as ribosomes, etc. Rupture and fusion during cell division make all protocells share the same frequency distribution of molecules during the origin of life, thus ensuring that all present cells have very similar genetic materials and protein translation systems. This also suggests that viruses may have originated and evolved together with cells.</description>

      <title>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it effects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph theoretical interpretation of the mean first passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog.</description>

      <title>CADGL: Context-Aware Deep Graph Learning for Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) is a pivotal element in the process of drug development. DDIs occur when one drug's properties are affected by the inclusion of other drugs. Detecting favorable DDIs has the potential to pave the way for creating and advancing innovative medications applicable in practical settings. However, existing DDI prediction models continue to face challenges related to generalization in extreme cases, robust feature extraction, and real-life application possibilities. We aim to address these challenges by leveraging the effectiveness of context-aware deep graph learning by introducing a novel framework named CADGL. Based on a customized variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), we capture critical structural and physio-chemical information using two context preprocessors for feature extraction from two different perspectives: local neighborhood and molecular context, in a heterogeneous graphical structure. Our customized VGAE consists of a graph encoder, a latent information encoder, and an MLP decoder. CADGL surpasses other state-of-the-art DDI prediction models, excelling in predicting clinically valuable novel DDIs, supported by rigorous case studies.</description>
