      <title>Capacity dimension of the Brjuno set in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that the complement of the Brjuno set in $\mathbb{C}^n$ has zero $C_\sigma$-capacity with respect to the kernel $k_\sigma(z,\xi)=\|z-\xi\|^{-2n+2}|\log{\|z-\xi\||^{\sigma}}$ for any $\sigma&gt;n$. In particular, it follows that it has zero $h_\delta$-Hausdorff measure with respect to the $h_\delta(t)=t^{2n-2}|\log{t}|^{-\delta}$, for any $\delta&gt;n+1$. This generalizes a previous result of Sadullaev and the second author in dimension one to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On certain subclasses of analytic and harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the class of harmonic functions $f=h+\overline{g}$ in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|&lt;1\}$, where $h$ and $g$ are analytic in $\mathbb{D}$ with the normalization $h(0)=g(0)=h'(0)-1=0$. Let $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{H}}^0(\alpha, M)$ denote the class of functions $f=h+ \overline{g}\in\mathcal{H}$ satisfying the conditions $\left|(1-\alpha)h'(z)+\alpha zh''(z)-1+\alpha\right|\leq M+\left|(1-\alpha)g'(z)+\alpha zg''(z)\right|$ with $g'(0)=0$ for $z\in\mathbb{D}$, $M&gt;0$ and $\alpha\in(0,1]$. In this paper, we investigate fundamental properties for functions in the class $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{H}}^0(\alpha, M)$, such as the coefficient bounds, growth estimates, starlikeness and some other properties. Furthermore, we obtain the sharp bound of the second Hankel determinant of inverse logarithmic coefficients for normalized analytic univalent functions $f\in\mathcal{P}(M)$ in $\mathbb{D}$ satisfying the condition $\text{Re}\left(zf''(z)\right)&gt;-M$ for $0&lt;M\leq 1/\log4$ and $z\in\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>On quotients of ideals of weighted holomorphic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the procedure given by left-hand quotients in the context of weighted holomorphic ideals. On the one hand, we show that this procedure does not generate new ideals other than the ideal of weighted holomorphic mappings when considering the left-hand quotients induced by the ideals of $p$-compact, weakly $p$-compact, unconditionally $p$-compact, approximable or right $p$-nuclear operators with their respective weighted holomorphic ideals. On the other hand, the procedure is of interest when considering other operators ideals as it provides new weighted holomorphic ideals. This is the case of the ideal of Grothendieck weighted holomorphic mappings or the ideal of Rosenthal weighted holomorphic mappings, where the applicability of this construction is shown.</description>

      <title>Existence of Conical Higher cscK Metrics on a Minimal Ruled Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A `higher extremal K\"ahler metric' is defined (motivated by analogy with the definition of an extremal K\"ahler metric) as a K\"ahler metric whose top Chern form and volume form ``differ'' by a smooth function whose gradient is a holomorphic vector field. A special case of this kind of metric is a `higher constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (higher cscK) metric' which is defined (again by analogy with the definition of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metric) as a K\"ahler metric whose top Chern form is a real constant multiple of its volume form or equivalently whose top Chern form is harmonic. In our previous paper on higher extremal K\"ahler metrics we had looked at a special class of minimal ruled surfaces called as `pseudo-Hirzebruch surfaces' all of which contain two special divisors (viz. the zero and infinity divisors) and have got some nice symmetries which enable the use of the momentum construction method for finding explicit examples of these kinds of ``canonical'' metrics. We had proven that every K\"ahler class on such a surface admits a higher extremal K\"ahler metric which is not higher cscK and we had further proven that higher cscK metrics do not exist in any K\"ahler class on such a surface. In this paper we will see that if we allow our metrics to develop `conical singularities' along at least one of the two divisors then we do get `conical higher cscK metrics' in each K\"ahler class of the surface by the momentum construction method. We will show that our constructed metrics are ``genuine'' conical K\"ahler metrics and we will interpret the conical higher cscK equation globally on the surface in terms of currents. We will then introduce and employ the `top $\log$ Bando-Futaki invariant' to obtain the linear relationship between the cone angles of the conical singularities of our constructed metrics along the zero and infinity divisors.</description>

      <title>On generalized harmonic quasiconformal Koebe functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of generalized harmonic quasiconformal Koebe functions. It is motivated by the shear construction of Clunie and Sheil-Small [Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Ser. A I Math. 9: 3--25, 1984] and the harmonic quasiconformal Koebe function. Equivalent univalence conditions, pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian norms, coefficient inequalities, as well as growth and area theorems for this family of functions are derived. These findings improve several previously known results.</description>

      <title>Segal's axioms and bootstrap for Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1987 Graeme Segal gave a functorial definition of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) that was designed to capture the mathematical essence of the Conformal Bootstrap formalism pioneered in physics by Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov. In Segal's formulation the basic objects of CFT, the correlation functions of conformal primary fields, are viewed as functions on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points which behave naturally under gluing of surfaces. In this paper we give a probabilistic realization of Segal's axioms in Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT) which is a CFT that plays a fundamental role in the theory of random surfaces and two dimensional quantum gravity. Then we use Segal's axioms to express the correlation functions of LCFT in terms of the basic objects of LCFT: its {\it spectrum} and its {\it structure constants}, determined in earlier works by the authors. As a consequence, we obtain a formula for the correlation functions as multiple integrals over the spectrum of LCFT, the structure of these integrals being associated to a pant decomposition of the surface. The integrand is the modulus squared of a function called conformal block: its structure is encoded by the commutation relations of an algebra of operators called the Virasoro algebra and it depends holomorphically on the moduli of the surface with marked points. The integration measure involves a product of structure constants, which have an explicit expression, the so called DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>On the equality of De Branges-Rovnyak and Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the comparison of de Branges--Rovnyak $H(b)$ spaces harmonically weighted Dirichlet spaces $\mathcal{D}_\mu$. We completely characterize which $H(b)$ spaces are also harmonically weighted Dirichlet spaces $\mathcal{D}_\mu$, when $\mu$ is a finite sum of atoms. This is a generalization of a previous result by Costara--Ransford \cite{costara2013}: we make no assumptions on the Pythagorean pair $(b,a)$, and we produce new examples.</description>
