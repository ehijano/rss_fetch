      <title>Discontinuity of Lyapunov exponents for SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ valued cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an example of a discontinuity point for the Lyapunov exponents as a function of the cocycle in the H\"older topology. The linear cocycle taking values in SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ is locally constant and defined over a Bernoulli shift. Our example extends Bocker-Viana's and Butler's results.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Linearizability of a Family of Three-Dimensional Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local integrability and linearizability of a family of three-dimensional polynomial systems with the matrix of the linear approximation having the eigenvalues $1, \zeta, \zeta^2 $, where $\zeta$ is a primitive cubic root of unity. We establish a criterion for the convergence of the Poincar\'e--Dulac normal form of the systems and examine the relationship between the normal form and integrability. Additionally, we introduce an efficient algorithm to determine the necessary conditions for the integrability of the systems. This algorithm is then applied to a quadratic subfamily of the systems to analyze its integrability and linearizability. Our findings offer insights into the integrability properties of three-dimensional polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>On the cyclicity of hyperbolic polycycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a planar smooth vector field with a polycycle $\Gamma^n$ with $n$ sides and all its corners, that are at most $n$ singularities, being hyperbolic saddles. In this paper we study the cyclicity of $\Gamma^n$ in terms of the hyperbolicity ratios of these saddles, giving explicit conditions that ensure that it is at least $k,$ for any $k\leqslant n.$ Our result extends old results and also provides a more accurate proof of the known ones because we rely on some recent powerful works that study in more detail the regularity with respect to initial conditions and parameters of the Dulac map of hyperbolic saddles for families of vector fields. We also prove that when $X$ is polynomial there is a polynomial perturbation (in general with degree much higher that the one of $X$) that attains each of the obtained lower bounds for the cyclicities. Finally, we also study some related inverse problems and provide concrete examples of applications in the polynomial world.</description>

      <title>Shift operators and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of linear bounded invertible operators on Banach spaces, called shift operators, which comprises weighted backward shifts and models finite products of weighted backward shifts and dissipative composition operators. We classify vast families of these shift operators, including the ones generated by orthogonal, diagonalizable, rotation or hyperbolic matrices. and this classification yields verifiable conditions which we use to construct concrete examples of shift operators with a variety of dynamical properties. As a consequence, we show that, for large classes of shift operators, generalized hyperbolicity is equivalent to the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of interacting oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the Master Stability Function shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. In summary, our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of Kuramoto populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>

Abstract: Towards a well-known open question in arithmetic dynamics, L. M\'erai, A. Ostafe and I. E. Shparlinski (2023), have shown, for a class of polynomials $f \in \mathbb Z[X]$, which in particular includes all quadratic polynomials, that, under some natural conditions (necessary for quadratic polynomials), the set of primes $p$, such that all iterations of $f$ are irreducible modulo $p$, is of relative density zero, with an explicit estimate on the rate of decay. This result relies on some bounds on character sums via the Brun sieve. Here we use the Selberg sieve and in some cases obtain a substantial quantitative improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of memristive devices offers a promising avenue for efficient and scalable analog computing, particularly for linear algebra operations essential in various scientific and engineering applications. This paper investigates the potential of memristive crossbars in implementing matrix inversion algorithms. We explore both static and dynamic approaches, emphasizing the advantages of analog and in-memory computing for matrix operations beyond multiplication. Our results demonstrate that memristive arrays can significantly reduce computational complexity and power consumption compared to traditional digital methods for certain matrix tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenges of device variability, precision, and scalability, providing insights into the practical implementation of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Joint Diffusion Processes as an Inductive Bias in Sheaf Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by endowing a cellular sheaf over the graph, equipping nodes and edges with vector spaces and defining linear mappings between them. While the attached geometric structure has proven to be useful in analyzing heterophily and oversmoothing, so far the methods by which the sheaf is computed do not always guarantee a good performance in such settings. In this work, drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics concepts, we propose two novel sheaf learning approaches that (i) provide a more intuitive understanding of the involved structure maps, (ii) introduce a useful inductive bias for heterophily and oversmoothing, and (iii) infer the sheaf in a way that does not scale with the number of features, thus using fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. In our evaluation, we show the limitations of the real-world benchmarks used so far on SNNs, and design a new synthetic task -- leveraging the symmetries of n-dimensional ellipsoids -- that enables us to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of sheaf-based models. Our extensive experimentation on these novel datasets reveals valuable insights into the scenarios and contexts where SNNs in general -- and our proposed approaches in particular -- can be beneficial.</description>

      <title>Information index augmented eRG to model vaccination behaviour: A case study of COVID-19 in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pandemics triggered the development of a number of mathematical models and computational tools apt at curbing the socio-economic impact of these and future pandemics. The need to acquire solid estimates from the data led to the introduction of effective approaches such as the \emph{epidemiological Renormalization Group} (eRG). A recognized relevant factor impacting the evolution of pandemics is the feedback stemming from individuals' choices. The latter can be taken into account via the \textit{information index} which accommodates the information--induced perception regarding the status of the disease and the memory of past spread. We, therefore, show how to augment the eRG by means of the information index. We first develop the {\it behavioural} version of the eRG and then test it against the US vaccination campaign for COVID-19. We find that the behavioural augmented eRG improves the description of the pandemic dynamics of the US divisions for which the epidemic peak occurs after the start of the vaccination campaign. Our results strengthen the relevance of taking into account the human behaviour component when modelling pandemic evolution. To inform public health policies, the model can be readily employed to investigate the socio-epidemiological dynamics, including vaccination campaigns, for other regions of the world.</description>

      <title>Improving PINNs By Algebraic Inclusion of Boundary and Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "AI for Science" aims to solve fundamental scientific problems using AI techniques. As most physical phenomena can be described as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) , approximating their solutions using neural networks has evolved as a central component of scientific-ML. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is the general method that has evolved for this task but its training is well-known to be very unstable. In this work we explore the possibility of changing the model being trained from being just a neural network to being a non-linear transformation of it - one that algebraically includes the boundary/initial conditions. This reduces the number of terms in the loss function than the standard PINN losses. We demonstrate that our modification leads to significant performance gains across a range of benchmark tasks, in various dimensions and without having to tweak the training algorithm. Our conclusions are based on conducting hundreds of experiments, in the fully unsupervised setting, over multiple linear and non-linear PDEs set to exactly solvable scenarios, which lends to a concrete measurement of our performance gains in terms of order(s) of magnitude lower fractional errors being achieved, than by standard PINNs.

      <title>Generalized replicator dynamics based on mean-field pairwise comparison dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairwise comparison dynamic is a forward ordinary differential equation in a Banach space whose solution is a time-dependent probability measure to maximize utility based on a nonlinear and nonlocal protocol. It contains a wide class of evolutionary game models, such as replicator dynamics and its generalization. We present an inverse control approach to obtain a replicator-type pairwise comparison dynamic from the large discount limit of a mean field game (MFG) as a coupled forward-backward system. This methodology provides a new interpretation of replicator-type dynamics as a myopic perception limit of the dynamic programming. The cost function in the MFG is explicitly obtained to derive the generalized replicator dynamics. We present a finite difference method to compute these models such that the conservation and nonnegativity of the probability density and bounds of the value function can be numerically satisfied. We conduct a computational convergence study of a large discount limit, focusing on potential games and an energy management problem under several conditions.</description>

The Liouville measure is invariant for this billiard map. Finally, we show some dynamical properties such as ergodicity in the case of random circular billiards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area-preserving diffeomorphism of a compact surface, which is assumed to be an irrational rotation near each boundary component. A finite set of periodic orbits of the diffeomorphism gives rise to a braid in the mapping torus. We show that under some nondegeneracy hypotheses, the isotopy classes of braids that arise from finite sets of periodic orbits are stable under Hamiltonian perturbations that are small with respect to the Hofer metric. A corollary is that for a Hamiltonian isotopy class of such maps, the topological entropy is lower semicontinuous with respect to the Hofer metric. This extends results of Alves-Meiwes for braids arising from finite sets of fixed points of Hamiltonian surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of critical exponent functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last years the attention towards topological dynamical properties of highly discontinuous maps has increased significantly. In [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2022], a class of densely discontinuous interval maps, called "critical exponent maps", was introduced. These maps are defined through the word-combinatorics concept of critical exponent applied to the binary expansion of reals and show highly chaotically properties as well as some challenging problems. In this paper we identify an error in the proof of Theorem 7 in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2022], a purely combinatorial result which in fact does not hold. We show that most of the results in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2022], obtained there through Theorem 7, can be recovered. Moreover, we propose as a conjecture a weaker form of Theorem 7.</description>

Abstract: We study the number of the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_N$ and $\eta_D$ for several strictly convex disjoint obstacles satisfying non-eclipse condition. We obtain a strip $\{z \in \mathbb C:\: {\rm Re}\: s &gt; \beta\}$ with infinite number of poles. For $\eta_D$ we prove the same result assuming the boundary real analytic. Moreover, assuming the abscissa of convergence of the series (1.5} negative, for $\eta_N$ we obtain a characterisation of $\beta$ by the pressure $P(2G)$ of some function $G$ on the space $\Sigma_A^f$ related to the dynamical characteristics of the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem on CAT(0) spaces with contracting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a non-elementary action on a proper CAT(0) space $X$, and let $\mu$ be a measure on $G$ such that the random walk $(Z_n)_n$ generated by $\mu$ has finite second moment on $X$. Let $o$ be a basepoint in $X$, and assume that there exists a rank one isometry in $G$. We prove that in this context, $(Z_n o )_n$ satisfies a Central Limit Theorem, namely that the random variables $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(d(Z_n o, o) - n \lambda) $ converge in law to a non-degenerate Gaussian distribution $N_\mu$, for $\lambda$ the (positive) drift of the random walk. The strategy relies on the use of hyperbolic models introduced by H. Petyt, A. Zalloum and D. Spriano, which are analogues of curve graphs and cubical hyperplanes for the class of CAT(0) spaces. As a side result, we prove that the probability that the nth-step $Z_n$ acts on $X$ as a contracting isometry goes to 1 as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>The instability mechanism of compact multiplanet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of $N$-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover $N$-body instability times. This points toward a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances, generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances, overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semi-major axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the $1/4$ power, rather than the frequently adopted $1/3$ power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets' orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune-mass planets must be spaced with period ratios $P \gtrsim 1.35$ and that tightly spaced systems ($P \lesssim 1.5$) must possess very low eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.05$) to be stable for more than $10^9$ orbits.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modeling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modeling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>
