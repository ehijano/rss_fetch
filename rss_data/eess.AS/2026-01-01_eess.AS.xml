      <title>MiMo-Audio: Audio Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models. Model checkpoints and full evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Audio.</description>

      <title>Regularized autoregressive modeling and its application to audio signal reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) modeling is invaluable in signal processing, in particular in speech and audio fields. Attempts in the literature can be found that regularize or constrain either the time-domain signal values or the AR coefficients, which is done for various reasons, including the incorporation of prior information or numerical stabilization. Although these attempts are appealing, an encompassing and generic modeling framework is still missing. We propose such a framework and the related optimization problem and algorithm. We discuss the computational demands of the algorithm and explore the effects of various improvements on its convergence speed. In the experimental part, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on the audio declipping and dequantization problems. We compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method in declipping musical signals, and its superiority in declipping speech. The evaluation includes a heuristic algorithm of generalized linear prediction (GLP), a strong competitor which has only been presented as a patent and is new in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Automatic Stage Lighting Control: Is it a Rule-Driven Process or Generative Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stage lighting is a vital component in live music performances, shaping an engaging experience for both musicians and audiences. In recent years, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has attracted growing interest due to the high costs of hiring or training professional lighting engineers. However, most existing ASLC solutions only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this gap, this paper presents Skip-BART, an end-to-end model that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers and predict vivid, human-like stage lighting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method adapts the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid. To address the lack of available datasets, we create the first stage lighting dataset, along with several pre-training and transfer learning techniques to improve model training with limited data. We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers. To support further research, we have made our self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at https://github.com/RS2002/Skip-BART .</description>

      <title>Mamba2 Meets Silence: Robust Vocal Source Separation for Sparse Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for broader applications in audio research.</description>

      <title>STSR: High-Fidelity Speech Super-Resolution via Spectral-Transient Context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SR) reconstructs high-fidelity wideband speech from low-resolution inputs-a task that necessitates reconciling global harmonic coherence with local transient sharpness. While diffusion-based generative models yield impressive fidelity, their practical deployment is often stymied by prohibitive computational demands. Conversely, efficient time-domain architectures lack the explicit frequency representations essential for capturing long-range spectral dependencies and ensuring precise harmonic alignment. We introduce STSR, a unified end-to-end framework formulated in the MDCT domain to circumvent these limitations. STSR employs a Spectral-Contextual Attention mechanism that harnesses hierarchical windowing to adaptively aggregate non-local spectral context, enabling consistent harmonic reconstruction up to 48 kHz. Concurrently, a sparse-aware regularization strategy is employed to mitigate the suppression of transient components inherent in compressed spectral representations. STSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perceptual fidelity and zero-shot generalization, providing a robust, real-time paradigm for high-quality speech restoration.</description>

      <title>Chunk Based Speech Pre-training with High Resolution Finite Scalar Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low latency speech human-machine communication is becoming increasingly necessary as speech technology advances quickly in the last decade. One of the primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e., speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the \textsc{Librispeech} and \textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method could achieve very competitive results for speech to text tasks at both streaming and offline modes.</description>

      <title>Hear: Hierarchically Enhanced Aesthetic Representations For Multidimensional Music Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating song aesthetics is challenging due to the multidimensional nature of musical perception and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose HEAR, a robust music aesthetic evaluation framework that combines: (1) a multi-source multi-scale representations module to obtain complementary segment- and track-level features, (2) a hierarchical augmentation strategy to mitigate overfitting, and (3) a hybrid training objective that integrates regression and ranking losses for accurate scoring and reliable top-tier song identification. Experiments demonstrate that HEAR consistently outperforms the baseline across all metrics on both tracks of the ICASSP 2026 SongEval benchmark. The code and trained model weights are available at https://github.com/Eps-Acoustic-Revolution-Lab/EAR_HEAR.</description>

      <title>Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/Fun-Audio-Chat .</description>
