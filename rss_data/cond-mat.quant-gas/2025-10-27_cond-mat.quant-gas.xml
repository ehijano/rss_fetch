      <title>Unveiling the BEC-droplet transition with Rayleigh superradiant scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition in One-Dimensional Bose-Hubbard Model in the Strong Interacting Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigated the dynamical quantum phase transitions in the Bose-Hubbard model using the Loschmidt echo as an observable, revealing that after a quench, the global Loschmidt echo exhibits cusp singularities with a logarithmically divergent rate function near criticality and a critical exponent of zero. Through extensive calculations across various system sizes and initial states, we have demonstrated that in the strongly interacting regime, the critical singularity of dynamical quantum phase transitions exhibits consistency across different model details and initial product states (charge-density wave states). Moreover, we find that modifying the harmonic potential well not only preserves the phase transition but also enables precise control over the transition timing.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of a dilute inhomogeneous Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a system of N fermions with two spin states in the large N limit. The particles are placed in an inhomogeneous trapping potential and interact via scaled interactions. We study a dilute limit where the range of the interaction potential is much smaller than the typical inter-particle distance. We show that the energy per particle converges to the Thomas-Fermi energy of the system, with a perturbative term corresponding tot he interaction and exhibiting the scattering length of the potential. The proof is decomposed into two bounds. First, we construct an appropriate test-state to prove the upper bound. Then, we prove the lower bound by the Dyson lemma, which allows us to regularize the interaction potential, and several semi-classical tools.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By examining rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensates through the perspective of large spin, we identify a novel type of topological point defects in the magnetization texture. These defects are not predicted by conventional homotopy analysis but rather by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The magnetization texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice contains doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects, where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure describes an unconventional "unvortex" lattice, which contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity is concentrated exclusively within defect points. Numerical results are presented, confirming these predictions and demonstrating their persistence in smaller-spin condensates.</description>

      <title>Multimode NOON-state generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic formation of supersolid phase in a mixture of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamical properties of a mixture consisting of a dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. In particular, we focus on the system's response to a temporal variation in the interaction strength between bosons and fermions. When the interspecies attraction becomes sufficiently strong, we observe a phase transition to a supersolid state. This conclusion is supported by the emergence of an out-of-phase Goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\deg}, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>
