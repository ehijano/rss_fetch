      <title>A Comprehensive Guide to Mesh Simplification using Edge Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh simplification is the process of reducing the number of vertices, edges and triangles in a three-dimensional (3D) mesh while preserving the overall shape and salient features of the mesh. A popular strategy for this is edge collapse, where an edge connecting two vertices is merged into a single vertex. The edge to collapse is chosen based on a cost function that estimates the error introduced by this collapse. This paper presents a comprehensive, implementation-oriented guide to edge collapse for practitioners and researchers seeking both theoretical grounding and practical insight. We review and derive the underlying mathematics and provide reference implementations for foundational cost functions including Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) and Lindstrom-Turk's geometric criteria. We also explain the mathematics behind attribute-aware edge collapse in QEM variants and Hoppe's energy-based method used in progressive meshes. In addition to cost functions, we outline the complete edge collapse algorithm, including the specific sequence of operations and the data structures that are commonly used. To create a robust system, we also cover the necessary programmatic safeguards that prevent issues like mesh degeneracies, inverted normals, and improper handling of boundary conditions. The goal of this work is not only to consolidate established methods but also to bridge the gap between theory and practice, offering a clear, step-by-step guide for implementing mesh simplification pipelines based on edge collapse.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Rectangle Packing Solved by Multi-Level Recursive Logic-based Benders Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional hierarchical rectangle packing problem, motivated by applications in analog integrated circuit layout, facility layout, and logistics. Unlike classical strip or bin packing, the dimensions of the container are not fixed, and the packing is inherently hierarchical: each item is either a rectangle or a block occurrence, whose dimensions are a solution of another packing problem. This recursive structure reflects real-world scenarios in which components, boxes, or modules must be packed within higher-level containers. We formally define the problem and propose exact formulations in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming. Given the computational difficulty of solving complex packing instances directly, we propose decomposition heuristics. First, we implement an existing Bottom-Up baseline method that solves subblocks before combining them at higher levels. Building upon this, we introduce a novel multilevel Logic-based Benders Decomposition method. This heuristic method dynamically refines block dimension constraints, eliminating the need for manual selection of candidate widths or aspect ratios. Experiments on synthetic instances with up to seven hierarchy levels, 80 items per block, and limited computation time show that the proposed decomposition significantly outperforms both monolithic formulations and the Bottom-Up method in terms of solution quality and scalability.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for Interpretable Graph Features via Motivic Persistent Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Chromatic Persistence Algorithm (CPA), an event-driven method for computing persistent cohomological features of weighted graphs via graphic arrangements, a classical object in computational geometry. We establish rigorous complexity results: CPA is exponential in the worst case, fixed-parameter tractable in treewidth, and nearly linear for common graph families such as trees, cycles, and series-parallel graphs. Finally, we demonstrate its practical applicability through a controlled experiment on molecular-like graph structures.</description>

      <title>Top-K Exterior Power Persistent Homology: Algorithm, Structure, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exterior powers play important roles in persistent homology in computational geometry. In the present paper we study the problem of extracting the $K$ longest intervals of the exterior-power layers of a tame persistence module. We prove a structural decomposition theorem that organizes the exterior-power layers into monotone per-anchor streams with explicit multiplicities, enabling a best-first algorithm. We also show that the Top-$K$ length vector is $2$-Lipschitz under bottleneck perturbations of the input barcode, and prove a comparison-model lower bound. Our experiments confirm the theory, showing speedups over full enumeration in high overlap cases. By enabling efficient extraction of the most prominent features, our approach makes higher-order persistence feasible for large datasets and thus broadly applicable to machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Throughput: CUDA-Optimized APML for Large-Batch 3D Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml</description>
