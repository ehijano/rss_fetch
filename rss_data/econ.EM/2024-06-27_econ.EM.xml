      <title>A Note on Identification of Match Fixed Effects as Interpretable Unobserved Match Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight that match fixed effects, represented by the coefficients of interaction terms involving dummy variables for two elements, lack identification without specific restrictions on parameters. Consequently, the coefficients typically reported as relative match fixed effects by statistical software are not interpretable. To address this, we establish normalization conditions that enable identification of match fixed effect parameters as interpretable indicators of unobserved match affinity, facilitating comparisons among observed matches.</description>

      <title>Factor multivariate stochastic volatility models of high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the pertinence of the factor decomposition to break the curse of dimensionality inherent to multivariate volatility processes, we develop a factor model-based multivariate stochastic volatility (fMSV) framework that relies on two viewpoints: sparse approximate factor model and sparse factor loading matrix. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure for the fMSV model: the first stage obtains the estimators of the factor model, and the second stage estimates the MSV part using the estimated common factor variables. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators. Simulated experiments are performed to assess the forecasting performances of the covariance matrices. The empirical analysis based on vectors of asset returns illustrates that the forecasting performances of the fMSV models outperforms competing conditional covariance models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic equivalence of Principal Components and Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimators in Large Approximate Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09864v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of an approximate factor model for an $n$-dimensional vector of stationary time series. We prove that the factor loadings estimated by Quasi Maximum Likelihood are asymptotically equivalent, as $n\to\infty$, to those estimated via Principal Components. Both estimators are, in turn, also asymptotically equivalent, as $n\to\infty$, to the unfeasible Ordinary Least Squares estimator we would have if the factors were observed. We also show that the usual sandwich form of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the simpler asymptotic covariance matrix of the unfeasible Ordinary Least Squares. All these results hold in the general case in which the idiosyncratic components are cross-sectionally heteroskedastic, as well as serially and cross-sectionally weakly correlated. The intuition behind these results is that as $n\to\infty$ the factors can be considered as observed, thus showing that factor models enjoy a blessing of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Inference in Experiments with Matched Pairs and Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies inference for the local average treatment effect in randomized controlled trials with imperfect compliance where treatment status is determined according to "matched pairs." By "matched pairs," we mean that units are sampled i.i.d. from the population of interest, paired according to observed, baseline covariates and finally, within each pair, one unit is selected at random for treatment. Under weak assumptions governing the quality of the pairings, we first derive the limit distribution of the usual Wald (i.e., two-stage least squares) estimator of the local average treatment effect. We show further that conventional heteroskedasticity-robust estimators of the Wald estimator's limiting variance are generally conservative, in that their probability limits are (typically strictly) larger than the limiting variance. We therefore provide an alternative estimator of the limiting variance that is consistent. Finally, we consider the use of additional observed, baseline covariates not used in pairing units to increase the precision with which we can estimate the local average treatment effect. To this end, we derive the limiting behavior of a two-stage least squares estimator of the local average treatment effect which includes both the additional covariates in addition to pair fixed effects, and show that its limiting variance is always less than or equal to that of the Wald estimator. To complete our analysis, we provide a consistent estimator of this limiting variance. A simulation study confirms the practical relevance of our theoretical results. Finally, we apply our results to revisit a prominent experiment studying the effect of macroinsurance on microenterprise in Egypt.</description>

      <title>Manipulation Test for Multidimensional RDD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The causal inference model proposed by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity design (RDD) relies on assumptions that imply the continuity of the density of the assignment (running) variable. The test for this implication is commonly referred to as the manipulation test and is regularly reported in applied research to strengthen the design's validity. The multidimensional RDD (MRDD) extends the RDD to contexts where treatment assignment depends on several running variables. This paper introduces a manipulation test for the MRDD. First, it develops a theoretical model for causal inference with the MRDD, used to derive a testable implication on the conditional marginal densities of the running variables. Then, it constructs the test for the implication based on a quadratic form of a vector of statistics separately computed for each marginal density. Finally, the proposed test is compared with alternative procedures commonly employed in applied research.</description>

      <title>Cutting Feedback in Misspecified Copula Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In copula models the marginal distributions and copula function are specified separately. We treat these as two modules in a modular Bayesian inference framework, and propose conducting modified Bayesian inference by "cutting feedback". Cutting feedback limits the influence of potentially misspecified modules in posterior inference. We consider two types of cuts. The first limits the influence of a misspecified copula on inference for the marginals, which is a Bayesian analogue of the popular Inference for Margins (IFM) estimator. The second limits the influence of misspecified marginals on inference for the copula parameters by using a pseudo likelihood of the ranks to define the cut model. We establish that if only one of the modules is misspecified, then the appropriate cut posterior gives accurate uncertainty quantification asymptotically for the parameters in the other module. Computation of the cut posteriors is difficult, and new variational inference methods to do so are proposed. The efficacy of the new methodology is demonstrated using both simulated data and a substantive multivariate time series application from macroeconomic forecasting. In the latter, cutting feedback from misspecified marginals to a 1096 dimension copula improves posterior inference and predictive accuracy greatly, compared to conventional Bayesian inference.</description>
