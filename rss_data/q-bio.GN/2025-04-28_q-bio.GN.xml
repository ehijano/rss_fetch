      <title>An Integrated Genomics Workflow Tool: Simulating Reads, Evaluating Read Alignments, and Optimizing Variant Calling Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a pivotal technique in genome sequencing due to its high throughput, rapid results, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced accuracy. Its significance extends across various domains, playing a crucial role in identifying genetic variations and exploring genomic complexity. NGS finds applications in diverse fields such as clinical genomics, comparative genomics, functional genomics, and metagenomics, contributing substantially to advancements in research, medicine, and scientific disciplines. Within the sphere of genomics data science, the execution of read simulation, mapping, and variant calling holds paramount importance for obtaining precise and dependable results. Given the plethora of tools available for these purposes, each employing distinct methodologies and options, a nuanced understanding of their intricacies becomes imperative for optimization. This research, situated at the intersection of data science and genomics, involves a meticulous assessment of various tools, elucidating their individual strengths and weaknesses through rigorous experimentation and analysis. This comprehensive evaluation has enabled the researchers to pinpoint the most accurate tools, reinforcing the alignment between the established workflow and the demonstrated efficacy of specific tools in the context of genomics data analysis. To meet these requirements, "VarFind", an open-source and freely accessible pipeline tool designed to automate the entire process has been introduced (VarFind GitHub repository: https://github.com/shanikawm/varfinder)</description>
