      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving long-time simulations of turbulence in magnetized ideal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie-Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.</description>

      <title>Runaway electrons during a coil quench in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that avalanches of runaway electrons can arise in stellarators, even if there is no net toroidal current in the plasma or the magnetic-field coils, if the current in the latter varies rapidly enough, e.g. due to a superconductor quench. In present-day devices such as W7-X, significant runaway generation is theoretically possible only at very low gas or plasma density in the vacuum vessel, e.g. between discharges, if a seed population of free electrons is present. In reactor-scale stellarators, more dangerous runaway generation may occur both between discharges and during low-density plasma operation. Since a radiation-induced seed population is necessarily present in an activated device, an accidental coil ramp-down could convert substantial magnetic energy into wall-damaging runaway currents. There is however much more time to mitigate such events than in tokamaks disruptions.</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>

      <title>Modeling of runaway electron induced damage on boron-nitride tiles in WEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The runaway electron (RE) - induced damage on boron nitride (BN) tiles mounted on the inner bumpers of the WEST tokamak is modeled employing available empirical input and experimental constraints, concerning the post-mortem documentation of the damaged material topology and infra-red camera observations of the long-time decay of the surface temperature. A newly developed work-flow for the modeling of brittle failure due to RE impacts, recently validated against a controlled DIII-D experiment, is employed. Monte Carlo simulations of RE transport into BN provide volumetric heat source maps for finite-element simulations of the linear thermoelastic material response, while the brittle failure onset is predicted on the basis of the Rankine criterion. The physics of thermal stress driven failure and explosion are well captured by this model, which exhibits high sensitivity to RE impact parameters. Despite the accidental nature of the damage events, the workflow predicts failure in accordance with observations for realistic loading specifications expected in WEST disruptions.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron pair generation using a single kJ-class laser pulse in a foam-reflector setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the process of creating electron-positron pairs from laser-matter interaction in pre-ionised foam targets using particle-in-cell simulations. A high-intensity laser pulse drives electrons via direct laser acceleration up to a cone-shaped reflector. The high-energy electrons interact with the reflected laser pulse, generating abundant pairs. The effects of the plasma-channel shape on the propagation of the laser pulse and subsequent pair production is studied. The results show that the number of Compton emission and Breit-Wheeler pair creation events is highly sensitive to the diffraction of the laser due to its interaction with the foam.</description>

      <title>On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</description>

      <title>A novel agile THz Pulsed Spectropolarimeter measuring 2D distributions of the magnetic field, density and ion temperature of fusion reactor equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent inception of intense pulsed THz sources via optical rectification using crystalline lithium niobate, non-perturbative measurements of the internal local magnetic field are now possible using Pulsed Polarimetry on any magnetic fusion device. Pulsed Polarimetry resolves the sightline magnetic field and density, analogous to RADAR measurements of the spatial distribution of precipitation. With a suitable sightline, the FRC midplane density and axial field profiles can be determined with the azimuthal current density given by Ampere's law. Pulsed Polarimetry can be enhanced to measure the sightline distributed electron temperature by adding spectroscopy. A THz Pulsed Spectropolarimeter using a heterodyne receiver is appropriate if collective Thomson backscatter is induced. In this case, electronic filtering provides spatial distributions of the ion spectral density function. The sightline bulk ion temperature as well as confined fast ion velocity distributions can be measured which is of particular importance to plasmas that are heated and sustained by NBI. The ability to steer the sightline without loss of alignment distinguishes this diagnostic from crossbeam diagnostics. The term, diagnostic agility denotes a diagnostic's ability to provide both temporal and spatial real-time feedback on demand across the poloidal plane analogous to 2D imaging Doppler RADAR. THz Pulsed Spectropolarimetry is extensively detailed along with simulated measurements on an FRC equilibrium. Comparisons are made with long pulse CTS crossbeam diagnostics. The role this technique can play within the wider MFE program towards future fusion reactors as an advanced diagnostic is explored. The nature and breadth of the measurements fulfills the mission of future diagnostics to maintain and optimize fusion reactor performance.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cosmic Ray Transport resulting from Magnetic Mirroring and Resonant Curvature Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>From the Rose-DuBois Ansatz of Hot Spot Fields to the Instanton Solution: a Pedestrian Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a pedestrian presentation of some technical results recently published in mathematical physics with non-trivial implications for laser-plasma interaction. The aim is to get across the main results without going into the details of the calculations, nor offering a specialist's user guide, but by focusing conceptually on how these results modify the commonly-held description -- in terms of laser hot spot fields -- of backscattering instabilities with a spatially smoothed laser beam. The intended readers are plasma physicists as well as graduate students interested in laser-plasma interaction. No prior knowledge of scattering instabilities is required. Step by step, we explain how the laser hot spots are gradually replaced with other structures, called instantons, as the amplification of the scattered light increases. In the amplification range of interest for laser-plasma interaction, instanton--hot spot complexes tend to appear in the laser field (in addition to the expected hot spots), with a non-negligible probability. For even larger amplifications and systems longer than a hot spot length, the hot spot field description is clearly invalidated by the instanton takeover.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Flow Control in Hypersonic Rarefied Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method, developed for multiscale simulation of partially ionized plasmas, has been extended to unstructured meshes, enabling the modeling of electromagnetic flows around a hemisphere across near-continuum to rarefied regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma solver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are treated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional fluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through comparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a sphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75 pre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement with the reference and experimental data. The findings reveal that rarefied effects play a significant role in the prediction of electromagnetic flow control, underscoring the necessity of multiscale modeling in plasma flow applications.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>
