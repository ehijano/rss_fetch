      <title>Full-Scale Readout Electronics for the ECHo-100k Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the development of cryogenic particle detectors such as magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) allow the fabrication of sensor arrays with an increasing number of pixels. Since these detectors must be operated at the lowest temperatures, the readout of large detector arrays is still quite challenging. This is especially true for the ECHo experiment, which presently aims to simultaneously run 6,000 two-pixel detectors to investigate the electron neutrino mass. For this reason, we developed a readout system based on a microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) that is operated by a custom software-defined radio (SDR) at room-temperature. The SDR readout electronics consist of three distinct hardware units: a data processing board with a Xilinx ZynqUS+ MPSoC; a converter board that features DACs, ADCs, and a coherent clock distribution network; and a radio frequency front-end board to translate the signals between the baseband and the microwave domains. Here, we describe the characteristics of the full-scale SDR system. First, the generated frequency comb for driving the $\mu$MUX was evaluated. Subsequently, by operating the SDR in direct loopback, the crosstalk of the individual channels after frequency demultiplexing was investigated. Finally, the system was used with a 16-channel $\mu$MUX to evaluate the linearity of the SDR, and the noise contributed to the overall readout setup.</description>

      <title>ZynqMP-based board-management mezzanines for Serenity ATCA-blades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the CMS Phase-2 tracker back-end processing system, two mezzanines based on the Zynq Ultrascale+ Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) device have been developed to serve as centralized slow control and board management solution for the Serenity-family \textcolor{black}{Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA)} blades.
  This paper presents the developments of the MPSoC mezzanines to execute the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) software in the real-time capable processors of the MPSoC. In coordination with the Shelf Manager, once full-power is enabled, a CentOS-based Linux distribution is executed in the application processors of the MPSoC, on which EMPButler and the Serenity Management Shell (SMASH) are running.</description>

      <title>The CCube reconstruction algorithm for the SoLid experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SoLid experiment is a very-short-baseline experiment aimed at searching for nuclear reactor-produced active to sterile antineutrino oscillations. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented (the basic detection unit is a 5~cm side cube). High segmentation provides numerous advantages, including the precise location of Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of the considerate antineutrino energy estimator, and a powerful background reduction tool based on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of wavelength-shifting fibres coupled to a photodetector (MPPC). This paper describes the design of the reconstruction algorithm that allows maximum use of the granularity of the detector. The goal of the algorithm is to convert the output of the optical-fibre readout to the list of the detection units from which it originated. This paper provides a performance comparison for three methods and concludes with a choice of the baseline approach for the experiment.</description>

      <title>Class-E, Active Electrically-Small Antenna for High-Power Wideband Transmission at the High-Frequency (HF) Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antennas operating at the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30 MHz) are frequently electrically small due to the large wavelength of electromagnetic waves (10-100 m). However, the bandwidth-efficiency products of passively matched electrically small antennas (ESAs) are fundamentally limited. Wideband HF waveforms using bandwidths of 24 kHz or more have recently received significant attention in military communications applications. Efficiently radiating such signals from conventional passive ESAs is very challenging due to fundamental physical limits on bandwidth-efficiency products of ESAs. However, active antennas are not subject to the same constraints. In this work, we present the design and experimental characterization of a high-power, active ESA with enhanced bandwidth-efficiency product compared to {that of} passively matched ESAs. Specifically, the proposed active ESA can radiate wideband HF signals with banwidths of 24 kHz or more, with total efficiencies up to 80$\%$, and radiated power levels approaching 100 W. Our approach uses a highly-efficient, integrated class-E switching circuit specifically designed to drive an electrically small, high-Q HF antenna over a bandwidth exceeding 24 kHz. Using a high-Q RLC antenna model, we have successfully demonstrated wideband binary ASK, PSK, and FSK modulations with the proposed class-E switching architecture. Experimental results indicate that the bandwidth-efficiency product of this class-E active antenna is 5.4-9.8 dB higher than that of an equivalent passive design with the same data rate, and bit-error-rate (BER).</description>

      <title>Laser-pump-resistive-probe technique to study nanosecond-scale relaxation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard optical pump-probe methods analyze a system's temporal response to a laser pulse within sub-femtoseconds to several nanoseconds, constrained by the optical delay line's length. While resistance is a sensitive detector in various fields, its measurements are typically slow (&gt;microseconds) due to stabilization requirements. We suggest here a time-resolved pump-probe technique which combines an optical pump pulse and a rectangular electrical probe pulse through the sample, measuring transmission in a 50 Ohm matched circuit with a digital oscilloscope. This allows electrically-driven delays from nanoseconds to seconds. Demonstrations include studying heat-induced changes in a thin amorphous VO$_x$ film and carrier relaxation in a CdS photoresistor, showcasing potential applications in heat transfer, biochemical reactions, and gradual electronic transformations.</description>
