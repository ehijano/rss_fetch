      <title>Giant superhydrophobic slip of shear-thinning liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically illustrate how complex fluids flowing over superhydrophobic surfaces may exhibit giant flow enhancements in the double limit of small solid fractions ($\epsilon\ll1$) and strong shear thinning ($\beta\ll1$, $\beta$ being the ratio of the viscosity at infinite shear rate to that at zero shear rate). Considering a Carreau liquid within the canonical scenario of longitudinal shear-driven flow over a grooved superhydrophobic surface, we show that, as $\beta$ is decreased, the scaling of the effective slip length at small solid fractions is enhanced from the logarithmic scaling $\ln(1/\epsilon)$ for Newtonian fluids to the algebraic scaling $1/\epsilon^{\frac{1-n}{n}}$, attained for $\beta=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{\frac{1-n}{n}})$, $n\in(0,1)$ being the exponent in the Carreau model. We illuminate this scaling enhancement and the geometric-rheological mechanism underlying it through asymptotic arguments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Periodic Steady Vortices in a Stagnation Point Flow II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-state perturbations to a stagnation point flow of the form ${\bf U}=(0,A'y,-A'z)$ are known which consist of a periodic array of counter-rotating vortices whose axes are parallel to the $y$-axis and which lie in the plane $z=0$. A new understanding of how these vortices depend on the supply of incoming vorticity from afar has lead to the discovery of new families of steady-state periodic vortices that can exist in a stagnation point flow. These new flows have a greater variety of structures than those previously known.
  An understanding of the linkage between the vortices and the weak inflow of vorticity can have important implications for situations where such vortices are observed.</description>

      <title>Large/small eddy simulations: A high-fidelity method for studying high-Reynolds number turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are one of the main ab initio tools to study turbulent flows. However, due to their considerable computational cost, DNS are primarily restricted to canonical flows at moderate Reynolds numbers, in which turbulence is isolated from the realistic, large-scale flow dynamics. In contrast, lower fidelity techniques, such as large eddy simulations (LES), are employed for modelling real-life systems. Such approaches rely on closure models that make multiple assumptions, including turbulent equilibrium, small-scale universality, etc., which require prior knowledge of the flow and can be violated. We propose a method, which couples a lower-fidelity, unresolved, time-dependent calculation of an entire system (LES) with an embedded Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) that provides a high-fidelity, fully resolved solution in a sub-region of interest of the LES. Such coupling is achieved by continuous replacement of the large SES scales with a low-pass filtered LES velocity field. The method is formulated in physical space, makes no assumptions of equilibrium, small-scale structure, and boundary conditions. A priori tests of both steady and unsteady homogeneous, isotropic turbulence are used to demonstrate the method accuracy in recovering turbulence properties, including spectra, probability density functions of the intermittent quantities, and sub-grid dissipation. Finally, SES is compared with two alternative approaches: one embedding a high-resolution region through static mesh refinement and a generalization of the traditional volumetric spectral forcing. Unlike these methods, SES is shown to achieve DNS-level accuracy at a fraction of the cost of the full DNS, thus opening the possibility to study high-Re flows.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting for multidimensional detonation waves simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting was used for simulation of multidimensional reacting flows with detonation waves. The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell WENO finite-volume limiting for simulation of non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter was used to simulate non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows. The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection-reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out. It was shown that the space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter can be used to simulate flows without using of splitting in directions and fractional step methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Boiling of Nanofluids in Copper Foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluids are suspensions of nanoscale particles (such as metals and their oxides) in base fluids (such as water, oil, or alcohol), which can significantly enhance the heat transfer performance of the base fluid. However, when nanofluids are applied to heat pipes, it is common for nanoparticles to accumulate within the heat pipe's capillary wick, clogging it and increasing thermal resistance. This paper investigates the phenomenon of boiling of water and nanofluids enhanced by copper foam through experimental methods. When the liquid is injected into copper foam placed on a heating plate, some of the liquid is squeezed out along the boundary of the heated surface of the copper foam during boiling. This phenomenon is independent of gravity but related to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the heating surface. Based on these properties, we design a device to guide the squeezed-out liquid to other locations, offering a promising solution to the problem of nanoparticle accumulation in the heat pipe's capillary wick.</description>

      <title>Advancing flight physics through natural adaptation and animal learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics, and flight in particular, is a domain where organisms challenge our understanding of its physics. Integrating the current knowledge of animal flight, we propose to revisit the use of live animals to study physical phenomena. After a short description of the physics of flight, we examine the broad literature on animal flight focusing on studies of living animals. We start out reviewing the diverse animal species studied so far and then focus on the experimental techniques used to study them quantitatively. Our network analysis reveals how the three clades of animals performing powered flight - insects, birds and bats - are studied using substantially different combinations of measurement techniques. We then combine these insights with a new paradigm for increasing our physical understanding of flight. This paradigm relies on the concept of Animal Learning, where animals are used as probes to study fluid phenomena and variables involved in flight, harnessing their natural adaptability.</description>

      <title>On force balance in Brinkman fluids under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A point force acting on a Brinkman fluid in confinement is always counterbalanced by the force on the porous medium, the force on the walls and the stress at open boundaries. We discuss the distribution of those forces in different geometries: a long pipe, a medium with a single no-slip planar boundary, a porous sphere with an open boundary and a porous sphere with a no-slip wall. We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for cellular processes such as cytoplasmic streaming and centrosome positioning.</description>

      <title>uniGasFoam: a particle-based OpenFOAM solver for multiscale rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents uniGasFoam, an open-source particle-based solver for multiscale rarefied gas flow simulations, which has been developed within the well-established OpenFOAM framework, and is an extension of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver dsmcFoam+. The developed solver addresses the coupling challenges inherent in hybrid continuum-particle methods, originating from the disparate nature of finite-volume (FV) solvers found in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and DSMC particle solvers. This is achieved by employing alternative stochastic particle methods, resembling DSMC, to tackle the continuum limit. The uniGasFoam particle-particle coupling produces a numerical implementation that is simpler and more robust, faster in many steady-state flows, and more scalable for transient flows compared to conventional continuum-particle coupling. The presented framework is unified and generic, and can couple DSMC with stochastic particle (SP) and unified stochastic particle (USP) methods, or be employed for pure DSMC, SP, and USP gas simulations. To enhance user experience, optimise computational resources and minimise user error, advanced adaptive algorithms such as transient adaptive sub-cells, non-uniform cell weighting, and adaptive global time stepping have been integrated into uniGasFoam. In this paper, the hybrid USP-DSMC module of uniGasFoam is rigorously validated through multiple benchmark cases, consistently showing excellent agreement with pure DSMC, hybrid CFD-DSMC, and literature results. Notably, uniGasFoam achieves significant computational gains compared to pure dsmcFoam+ simulations, rendering it a robust computational tool well-suited for addressing multiscale rarefied gas flows of engineering importance.</description>

      <title>Solid-Fluid Interaction on Particle Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel solid-fluid interaction method for coupling elastic solids with impulse flow maps. Our key idea is to unify the representation of fluid and solid components as particle flow maps with different lengths and dynamics. The solid-fluid coupling is enabled by implementing two novel mechanisms: first, we developed an impulse-to-velocity transfer mechanism to unify the exchanged physical quantities; second, we devised a particle path integral mechanism to accumulate coupling forces along each flow-map trajectory. Our framework integrates these two mechanisms into an Eulerian-Lagrangian impulse fluid simulator to accommodate traditional coupling models, exemplified by the Material Point Method (MPM) and Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), within a particle flow map framework. We demonstrate our method's efficacy by simulating solid-fluid interactions exhibiting strong vortical dynamics, including various vortex shedding and interaction examples across swimming, falling, breezing, and combustion.</description>

      <title>Mathematically established chaos in fluid dynamics: recurrent patterns forecast statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse in the Taylor-Couette system, a canonical flow that has been studied extensively for over a century, a parameter regime exhibiting dynamics that can be approximated by a simple discrete map. The map has exceptionally neat mathematical properties, allowing to prove its chaotic nature as well as the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic orbits. Remarkably, the fluid system and the discrete map share a common catalog of unstable periodic solutions with the tent map, a clear indication of topological conjugacy. A sufficient number of these solutions enables the construction of a conjugacy homeomorphism, which can be used to predict the probability density function of direct numerical simulations. These results rekindle Hopf's aspiration of elucidating turbulence through the study of recurrent patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the existence of solutions for the inviscid version of the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov equations in 3D, a macro-scale model of superfluidity. This system couples the incompressible Euler equations for the normal fluid and superfluid using a nonlinear mutual friction term that acts only at points of non-zero superfluid vorticity. In the first rigorous study of the inviscid HVBK system, we construct a unique local-in-time solution that is analytic in time and space.</description>

      <title>High-order accurate structure-preserving finite volume schemes on adaptive moving meshes for shallow water equations: Well-balancedness and positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops high-order accurate, well-balanced (WB), and positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume schemes for shallow water equations on adaptive moving structured meshes. The mesh movement poses new challenges in maintaining the WB property, which not only depends on the balance between flux gradients and source terms but is also affected by the mesh movement. To address these complexities, the WB property in curvilinear coordinates is decomposed into flux source balance and mesh movement balance. The flux source balance is achieved by suitable decomposition of the source terms, the numerical fluxes based on hydrostatic reconstruction, and appropriate discretization of the geometric conservation laws (GCLs). Concurrently, the mesh movement balance is maintained by integrating additional schemes to update the bottom topography during mesh adjustments. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to maintain the WB property by using the discrete GCLs and these two balances. We provide rigorous analyses of the PP property under a sufficient condition enforced by a PP limiter. Due to the involvement of mesh metrics and movement, the analyses are nontrivial, while some standard techniques, such as splitting high-order schemes into convex combinations of formally first-order PP schemes, are not directly applicable. Various numerical examples validate the high-order accuracy, high efficiency, WB, and PP properties of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Robust DG Schemes on Unstructured Triangular Meshes: Oscillation Elimination and Bound Preservation via Optimal Convex Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes on unstructured meshes offer the advantages of compactness and the ability to handle complex computational domains. However, their robustness and reliability in solving hyperbolic conservation laws depend on two critical abilities: suppressing spurious oscillations and preserving intrinsic bounds or constraints. This paper introduces two significant advancements in enhancing the robustness and efficiency of DG methods on unstructured meshes for general hyperbolic conservation laws, while maintaining their accuracy and compactness. First, we investigate the oscillation-eliminating (OE) DG methods on unstructured meshes. These methods not only maintain key features such as conservation, scale invariance, and evolution invariance but also achieve rotation invariance through a novel rotation-invariant OE (RIOE) procedure. Second, we propose, for the first time, the optimal convex decomposition for designing efficient bound-preserving (BP) DG schemes on unstructured meshes. Finding the optimal convex decomposition that maximizes the BP CFL number is an important yet challenging problem.While this challenge was addressed for rectangular meshes, it remains an open problem for triangular meshes. This paper successfully constructs the optimal convex decomposition for the widely used $P^1$ and $P^2$ spaces on triangular cells, significantly improving the efficiency of BP DG methods.The maximum BP CFL numbers are increased by 100%--200% for $P^1$ and 280.38%--350% for $P^2$, compared to classic decomposition. Furthermore, our RIOE procedure and optimal decomposition technique can be integrated into existing DG codes with little and localized modifications. These techniques require only edge-neighboring cell information, thereby retaining the compactness and high parallel efficiency of original DG methods.</description>

      <title>High-Order Oscillation-Eliminating Hermite WENO Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes high-order accurate, oscillation-eliminating Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory (OE-HWENO) finite volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The OE-HWENO schemes apply an OE procedure after each Runge--Kutta stage, dampening the first-order moments of the HWENO solution to suppress spurious oscillations without any problem-dependent parameters. This OE procedure acts as a filter, derived from the solution operator of a novel damping equation, solved exactly without discretization. As a result, the OE-HWENO method remains stable with a normal CFL number, even for strong shocks producing highly stiff damping terms. To ensure the method's non-oscillatory property across varying scales and wave speeds, we design a scale- and evolution-invariant damping equation and propose a dimensionless transformation for HWENO reconstruction. The OE-HWENO method offers several advantages over existing HWENO methods: the OE procedure is efficient and easy to implement, requiring only simple multiplication of first-order moments; it preserves high-order accuracy, local compactness, and spectral properties. The non-intrusive OE procedure can be integrated seamlessly into existing HWENO codes. Finally, we analyze the bound-preserving (BP) property using optimal cell average decomposition, relaxing the BP time step-size constraint and reducing decomposition points, improving efficiency. Extensive benchmarks validate the method's accuracy, efficiency, resolution, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Simulating fluid flows with quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications and impact of high fidelity simulation of fluid flows are far-reaching. They include settling some long-standing and fundamental questions in turbulence. However, the computational resources required for such efforts are extensive. Here, we explore the possibility of employing the recent computing paradigm of quantum computing to simulate fluid flows. The lure of this new paradigm is the potentially exponential advantage in memory and speed, in comparison with classical computing. This field has recently witnessed a considerable uptick in excitement and contributions. In this work, we give a succinct discussion of the progress made so far, with focus on fluid flows, accompanied by an enumeration of challenges that require sustained efforts for progress. Quantum computing of fluid flows has a promising future, but the inherently nonlinear nature of flows requires serious efforts on resolving various bottlenecks, and on synthesising progress on theoretical, numerical and experimental fronts. We present certain critical details that have not yet attracted adequate attention.</description>

      <title>PROSE-FD: A Multimodal PDE Foundation Model for Learning Multiple Operators for Forecasting Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PROSE-FD, a zero-shot multimodal PDE foundational model for simultaneous prediction of heterogeneous two-dimensional physical systems related to distinct fluid dynamics settings. These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks. We test our architecture choices with ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. This document presents some potential strategies for developing an Eulerian-Eulerian LBM solver tailored for multiphase systems. The paper first states what are the starting equations governing a multiphase flow in classical CFD. Secondly, it derives a pseudo-compressible (targeting the incompressible limit) system of equations for deriving the Eulerian-Eulerian LBM framework to simulate multiphase flows. Finally, a dispersed phase volume fraction equation is provided to balance the degree of freedom less due to the pressure gradient coupling. The effectiveness of these approaches can only be confirmed through rigorous numerical experimentation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II oocytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours. However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new, hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap. We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian meiosis.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales, whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work, we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged Euler-Poincare (LAEP) theory.</description>

      <title>Evanescent and inertial-like waves in rigidly-rotating odd viscous liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional non-rotating odd viscous liquids give rise to Taylor columns and support {axisymmetric} inertial-like waves [\emph{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. {973}, A30, (2023)]. When an odd viscous liquid is subjected to rigid-body rotation however, there arise in addition a plethora of other phenomena that need to be clarified. In this paper we show that three-dimensional incompressible or two-dimensional compressible odd viscous liquids, rotating rigidly with angular velocity $\Omega$, give rise to both oscillatory and evanescent inertial-like waves or a combination thereof (which we call of mixed type), that can be \emph{non-axisymmetric}. By evanescent we mean that along the radial direction, typically when moving away from a solid boundary, the velocity field decreases exponentially. These waves precess in a prograde or retrograde manner with respect to the rotating frame. The oscillatory and evanescent waves resemble, respectively, the body and wall-modes observed in (non-odd) rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection [\emph{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. {248}, pp. 583-604 (1993)]. We show that the three types of waves (wall, body or mixed) can be classified with respect to pairs of planar wavenumbers $\kappa$ which are complex, real or a combination, respectively. Experimentally, by observing the precession rate of the patterns, it would be possible to determine the largely unknown values of the odd viscosity coefficients. This formulation recovers as special cases recent studies of equatorial or topological waves in two-dimensional odd viscous liquids which provided examples of the bulk-interface correspondence at frequencies $\omega&lt;2\Omega$. We finally point out that the two and three-dimensional problems are formally equivalent. Their difference then lies in the way data propagate along characteristic rays in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity and the direct (enstrophy) cascade in two-dimensional fluid turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely used statistical theory of 2D turbulence developed by Kraichnan, Leith, and Batchelor (KLB) predicts a power-law scaling for the energy, $E(k)\propto k^\alpha$ with an integral exponent $\alpha={-3}$, in the inertial range associated with the direct cascade. In the presence of large-scale coherent structures, a power-law scaling is observed, but the exponent often differs substantially from the value predicted by the KLB theory. Here we present a dynamical theory which describes the key physical mechanism behind the direct cascade and sheds new light on the relationship between the structure of the large-scale flow and the scaling of the small-scale structures in the inertial range. This theory also goes a step beyond KLB, to predict the upper and lower bounds of the inertial range as well as the energy scaling in the dissipation range.</description>

      <title>General average balance equations and buoyancy closure for a mixture of a continuous fluid and rigid particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of motion of a continuous fluid and rigid, non-Brownian particles that interact through contacts are averaged to derive average balance equations. The averaging procedure is generic, requiring only linearity and commutation with the space and time derivatives. No assumptions about the fluid's rheology and the particles' shapes and compositions are made. We obtain mathematically exact micromechanical expressions for the fluid phase, solid phase, and mixture fields of interest. We demonstrate for a specific example, DNS-DEM simulations of sediment transport of spherical particles, that they can be conveniently extracted from particle-resolved CFD-DEM simulations without the need of approximations. In contrast, fields extracted using previous formalisms based on first-order Taylor expansions in the ratio between the particle size and the macroscopic flow scale are in clear disagreement with the exact ones due to a lack of scale separation. This study therefore lays the groundwork for numerically studying the rheology of particulate two-phase flows in systems without scale separation. We also use the simulations to test existing buoyancy closures, that is, decompositions of the fluid-solid interaction force density into a generalized-drag force density and a generalized-buoyancy force density. We find that only one existing closure is consistent with the data. However, it leads to a contradictory fluid momentum balance for certain stationary fluid-particle systems. We propose a physically-motivated improvement of it that resolves this contradiction.</description>

      <title>Towards a lattice-Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann model of thermal fluctuations in non-ideal fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic thermal fluctuations are known to affect the macroscopic and spatio-temporal evolution of a host of physical phenomena central to the study of biological systems, turbulence, and reactive mixtures, among others. In phase-changing fluids metastability and nucleation rates of embryos are known to be non-trivially affected by thermal noise stemming from molecules random velocity fluctuations, which ultimately determine the long-term growth, morphology, and decay of macroscopic bubbles in cavitation and boiling. We herein present the mathematical groundwork for a lattice-based solution of the combined Fokker-Planck and Boltzmann equations that by proxy solve the stochastic Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations and a non-ideal, cubic van der Waals equation of state. We present the derivation of the kinetic lattice-Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann equations facilitated by Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and show by multi-scale asymptotic analysis that the non-equilibrium dynamics in velocity space inherent to the Fokker-Planck equation manifest as stresses. The resulting coarse-grained lattice-Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann method (LFPBM) is attractive as its dynamics are hypothesized to continually evolve thermal fluctuations introduced into the thermo-hydrodynamic variables by initial conditions in a manner that obeys the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation balances. Simulations will be showcased in future publications.</description>

      <title>Scalar mixing and entrainment in an axisymmetric jet subjected to external turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study aims to understand the process of turbulent entrainment into a jet, as affected by background turbulence, using scalar statistics. Planar-laser-induced fluorescence was employed to capture the orthogonal cross sections of the jet at a fixed downstream station with varying background turbulence intensities and length scales. The conditional scalar profiles revealed that the thickness of the scalar turbulent/turbulent interface (TTI) is greater than that of the traditional turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI), and the interfacial thickness is an increasing function of the background turbulence intensity. Although nibbling remains the primary entrainment mechanism in the far field, increased occurrence of concentration 'holes' within the interfacial layer in the presence of ambient turbulence suggests a more significant role of large-scale engulfment in the turbulent/turbulent entrainment process (although still below 1% of the total mass flux). Enhanced contribution of the area of detached jet patches (i.e. 'islands') to that of the main jet is hypothesized to be evidence of intense detrainment events in the background turbulence. This can potentially result in a reduced net entrainment into the jet, which manifests as less negative values of scalar skewness within the jet core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling wave charges lying on the insulating walls of an electrolyte-filled capillary, give rise to oscillatory modes which vanish when averaged over the period of oscillation. They also give rise to a \emph{zero mode} (a unidirectional, time-independent velocity component) which does not vanish. The latter is a nonlinear effect caused by continuous symmetry-breaking due to the quadratic nonlinearity associated with the electric body force in the time-dependent Stokes equations. In this paper we provide a unified view of the effects arising in traveling wave electroosmosis and establish the universal behavior exhibited by the observables. We show that the incipient velocity profiles are self-similar implying that those obtained with a single experimental configuration, can be employed again to attain further insights without the need of repeating the experiment. Certain results from the literature are recovered as special cases of our formulation and we resolve certain paradoxes having appeared in the past. We present simple theoretical expressions, depending on a single fit parameter, that reproduce these profiles, which could thus provide a rapid test of consistency between our theory and future experiment. The effect becomes more pronounced when reducing the transverse dimension of the system, relative to the velocity direction, and increasing the excitation wavelength, and can therefore be employed for unidirectional transport of electrolytes in thin and long capillaries. General relations, expressing the zero mode velocity in terms of the electric potential and the geometry of the system only, can thus be easily adopted to suit alternative experimental settings.</description>

Abstract: Small bubbles in fluids raise to the surface due to Archimede's force. Remarkably, in turbulent flows this process is severely hindered by the presence of vortex filaments, which act as moving potential wells, dynamically trapping light particles and bubbles. Quantifying the statistical weights and roles of vortex filaments in turbulence is, however, still an outstanding experimental and computational challenge due to their small scale, fast chaotic motion, and transient nature. Here we show that, under the influence of a modulated oscillatory forcing, the collective bubble behaviour switches from a dynamically localized (insulator) to a delocalized (conductor) state. Additionally, we find that by varying the forcing frequency and amplitude, a remarkable resonant phenomenon between light particles and small-scale vortex filamenents emerges, likening particle behavior to a forced damped oscillator. We discuss how these externally actuated bubbles can be used as a new type of microscopic probes to investigate the space-time statistical properties of the smallest turbulence scales, allowing to quantitatively measure physical characteristics of vortex filaments. We develop a superposition model that is in excellent agreement with the simulation data of the particle dynamics which reveals the fraction of localized/delocalized particles as well as characteristics of the potential landscape induced by vortices in turbulence. Our approach paves the way to innovative ways to accurately measure turbulent properties and to the possibility to control light particles and bubble motions in turbulence with potential applications to wave breaking, medical imaging, drug/gene delivery, chemical reactions, wastewater treatment, and industrial mixing.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Phase-field Framework for Contact Dynamics between Deformable Solids in Fluid Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic contact in hydrodynamic environments is a complex multiphysics phenomenon and can be found in applications ranging from engineering to biological systems. Understanding the intricacies of this coupled problem requires the development of a generalized framework capable of handling topological changes and transitioning implicitly from FSI conditions to solid-solid contact conditions. We propose a mono-field interface advancing method for handling multibody contact simulations in submerged environments. Given the physical demands of the problem, we adopt a phase-field based fully Eulerian approach to resolve the multiphase and multibody interactions in the system. We employ a stabilized finite element formulation and a partitioned iterative procedure to solve the unified momentum equation comprising solid and fluid dynamics coupled with the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation. We introduce a contact force approach to handle smooth elastic-elastic and elastic-rigid contact based on the overlap of the diffused interfaces of two colliding bodies. We propose a novel approach to extend the model for multibody contact simulations while using a single phase-field function for all the solids. The method is based on updating the solid boundaries at every time step and checking for collisions among them. The developed approach eliminates the need to solve multiple phase field equations and multiple strain equations at every time step. This reduces the overall computational time by nearly $16\%$ compared to a multi phase-field approach. The implemented model is verified for smooth dry contact and FSI contact scenarios. Using the proposed framework, we demonstrate the collision dynamics between multiple bodies submerged in an open liquid tank.</description>

Abstract: We aim to reconstruct the shape of an exogenous, heavy solid contained in a tank from measurements of the liquid level in the tank as it drains (driven by gravity) through a small orifice in its side. (Because the solid displaces liquid, the rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the cross-sectional area of the solid at that height; as the liquid level drops, it "scans" the area of the solid as a function of height.) We combine mathematical modeling, Bayesian statistical inversion, Monte Carlo simulation, and wet experiments of a tank draining of water to demonstrate and test our ability to infer the cross-sectional area of the exogenous solid as a function of height. In our experiment, the posterior distribution over the [held-out] shape of the solid (a bottle) agreed reasonably well with our length-measurements (&lt;10% mean reconstruction error on its radius). Our approach may be practically useful to non-destructively characterize the geometry of an unknown solid, or a packed bed of solid particles, contained in an opaque tank.</description>

      <title>Mapping Driven Oscillations in the Size of a Bubble to the Dynamics of a Newtonian Particle in a Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-linear dynamics of driven oscillations in the size of a spherical bubble are mapped to the dynamics of a Newtonian particle in a potential within the incompressible liquid regime. The compressible liquid regime, which is important during the bubble's sonic collapse, is approached adiabatically. This new framework naturally distinguishes between the two time scales involved in the non-linear oscillations of a bubble. It also explains the experimentally observed sharp rebound of the bubble upon collapse. Guided by this new vantage point, we develop analytical approximations for several key aspects of bubble motion. First, we formulate a tensile strength law that integrates the bubble's ideal gas behavior with a general polytropic index. Next, we derive an acoustic energy dissipation formula for the bubble's sonic collapse, dependent solely on the bubble's collapse radii and velocity. Finally, we establish a straightforward physical criterion for Bjerknes force reversal, governed by the driving pressure, ambient pressure and tensile strength.</description>

      <title>Inertia drives concentration-wave turbulence in swimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover an instability mechanism in suspensions of self-propelled particles that does not involve active stress. Instead, it is driven by a subtle interplay of inertia, swimmer motility, and concentration fluctuations, through a crucial time lag between the velocity and the concentration field. The resulting time-persistent state seen in our high-resolution numerical simulations consists of self-sustained waves of concentration and orientation, transiting from regular oscillations to wave turbulence. We analyze the statistical features of this active turbulence, including an intriguing connection to the Batchelor spectrum of passive scalars.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Vortex Method on Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids. Central to our method is the novel incorporation of the flow-map transport equations for line elements, which, in combination with a bi-directional marching scheme for flow maps, enables the high-fidelity Eulerian advection of vorticity variables. The fundamental motivation is that, compared to impulse $\mathbf{m}$, which has been recently bridged with flow maps to encouraging results, vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ promises to be preferable for its numerical stability and physical interpretability. To realize the full potential of this novel formulation, we develop a new Poisson solving scheme for vorticity-to-velocity reconstruction that is both efficient and able to accurately handle the coupling near solid boundaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a range of vortex simulation examples, including leapfrog vortices, vortex collisions, cavity flow, and the formation of complex vortical structures due to solid-fluid interactions.</description>
