      <title>A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</description>

      <title>Testing the Limit of Atmospheric Predictability with a Machine Learning Weather Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric predictability research has long held that the limit of skillful deterministic weather forecasts is about 14 days. We challenge this limit using GraphCast, a machine-learning weather model, by optimizing forecast initial conditions using gradient-based techniques for twice-daily forecasts spanning 2020. This approach yields an average error reduction of 86% at 10 days, with skill lasting beyond 30 days. Mean optimal initial-condition perturbations reveal large-scale, spatially coherent corrections to ERA5, primarily reflecting an intensification of the Hadley circulation. Forecasts using GraphCast-optimal initial conditions in the Pangu-Weather model achieve a 21% error reduction, peaking at 4 days, indicating that analysis corrections reflect a combination of both model bias and a reduction in analysis error. These results demonstrate that, given accurate initial conditions, skillful deterministic forecasts are consistently achievable far beyond two weeks, challenging long-standing assumptions about the limits of atmospheric predictability.</description>

      <title>High-resolution geostationary satellite observations of free tropospheric NO2 over North America: implications for lightning emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free tropospheric (FT) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays a critical role in atmospheric oxidant chemistry as a source of tropospheric ozone and of the hydroxyl radical (OH). It also contributes significantly to satellite-observed tropospheric NO2 columns, and must be subtracted when using these columns to quantify surface emissions of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx = NO + NO2). But large uncertainties remain in the sources and chemistry of FT NO2 because observations are sparse. Here, we construct a new cloud-sliced FT NO2 (700-300 hPa) product from the TEMPO geostationary satellite instrument over North America. This product provides higher data density and quality than previous products from low Earth orbit (LEO) instruments, with the first observation of the FT NO2 diurnal cycle across seasons. Combined with coincident observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), the TEMPO data demonstrate the dominance of lightning as a source of FT NO2 in non-winter seasons. Comparison of TEMPO FT NO2 data with the GEOS-CF atmospheric chemistry model shows overall consistent magnitudes, seasonality, and diurnal variation, with a midday minimum in non-winter seasons from photochemical loss. However, there are major discrepancies that we attribute to GEOS-CF's use of a standard cloud-top-height (CTH)-based scheme for the lightning NOx source. We find this scheme greatly underestimates offshore lighting flash density and misrepresents the diurnal cycle of lightning over land. Our FT NO2 product provides a unique resource for improving the lightning NOx parameterization in atmospheric models and the ability to use NO2 observations from space to quantify surface NOx emissions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Storm Activity Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extratropical storms shape midlatitude weather and vary due to both the slowly evolving climate and the rapid changes in synoptic conditions. While the influence of each factor has been studied extensively, their relative importance remains unclear. Here, we quantify the climate's relative importance in both mean storm activity and individual storm development using 84 years of ERA-5 data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that the constructed CNN model predicts more than 90% of the variability in the mean storm activity. However, a similar model predicts up to a third of the variability in individual storm features, such as intensity, growth time, and storm trajectory, showing their variability is dominated by synoptic conditions. Isolating present-day climate change yields a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 0.16% for storm-intensity attribution, whereas the SNR for heat anomalies is ~50 times higher, highlighting that focusing on variables more directly tied to warming provides a clearer attribution pathway.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of the Tornadic Supercell in the province of Pampanga, Philippines (27 May 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides an integrated damage, visual, environmental, and remote sensing analysis of the tornado event that struck the suburb of Candating in Arayat, Pampanga on 27 May 2024. Satellite imagery and photographs of the damage indicate that the tornado caused EF2 damage on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale across a $\sim$2 km path. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal a well-defined wall cloud and low-level mesocyclone, but without a sign of precipitation curtain, indicative of its low-precipitation mode. Subsequent radar analysis supports these and other tornadic supercell features. Mid- and upper-tropospheric synoptic-scale ascent was subtle, influenced by the approach of TC Ewiniar. However, a modest meridional flow aloft over the area provided sufficient deep-layer shear to support supercell development. The Southwest Monsoon acted as a low-level jet, promoting warm, moist advection into western Luzon. The supercell developed around mid-noon and was characterized by large-undiluted instability, attributed to steep low-level lapse rates. Although low-level shear and its associated near-surface horizontal vorticity were weak, the latter is highly streamwise allowing for efficient ingestion, tilting, and stretching into vertical vorticity, which aided in tornadogenesis. Both satellite and radar data suggest that storm interactions (i.e., nudging process) and terrain interactions with nearby Mt. Arayat may have contributed to the initiation and intensification of the supercell through lee-side convergence and enhancing vorticity. The complex tropical environment of the Candating, Arayat tornado mirrors several characteristics of well-documented North American tornadic environments. This highlights the need for more research into the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadic activity in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Deep Learning for Correcting Global Climate Model Projections of SST and DSL in the Bay of Bengal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change alters ocean conditions, notably temperature and sea level. In the Bay of Bengal, these changes influence monsoon precipitation and marine productivity, critical to the Indian economy. In Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), Global Climate Models (GCMs) use different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to obtain future climate projections. However, significant discrepancies are observed between these models and the reanalysis data in the Bay of Bengal for 2015-2024. Specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the climate model output and the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5) is 1.2C for the sea surface temperature (SST) and 1.1 m for the dynamic sea level (DSL). We introduce a new data-driven deep learning model to correct for this bias. The deep neural model for each variable is trained using pairs of climatology-removed monthly climate projections as input and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as output. This model is trained with historical data (1950 to 2014), validated with future projection data from 2015 to 2020, and tested with future projections from 2021 to 2023. Compared to the conventional EquiDistant Cumulative Distribution Function (EDCDF) statistical method for bias correction in climate models, our approach decreases RMSE by 0.15C for SST and 0.3 m for DSL. The trained model subsequently corrects the projections for 2024-2100. A detailed analysis of the monthly, seasonal, and decadal means and variability is performed to underscore the implications of the novel dynamics uncovered in our corrected projections.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning (ML)-Physics Fusion Model Outperforms Both Physics-Only and ML-Only Models in Typhoon Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models, such as FuXi, exhibit notable limitations in forecasting typhoon intensity and structure. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of FuXi-SHTM, a hybrid ML-physics model, using all 2024 western North Pacific typhoon cases. The FuXi-SHTM hybrid demonstrates clear improvements in both track and intensity forecasts compared to the standalone SHTM, FuXi, and ECMWF HRES models. Compared to FuXi alone, FuXi-SHTM reduces typhoon track forecast errors by 16.5% and 5.2% at lead times of 72 h and 120 h, respectively, and reduces intensity forecast errors by 59.7% and 47.6%. Furthermore, FuXi-SHTM simulates cloud structures more realistically compared to SHTM, and achieves superior representation of the 10-m wind fields in both intensity and spatial structure compared to FuXi and SHTM. Increasing the resolution of FuXi-SHTM from 9 km to 3 km further enhances intensity forecasts, highlighting the critical role of the resolution of the physical model in advancing hybrid forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fragility Modeling of Power Grid Infrastructure for Addressing Climate Change Risks and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resilience of electric power grids is threatened by natural hazards. Climate-related hazards are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Statistical analyses clearly demonstrate a rise in the number of incidents (power failures) and their consequences in recent years. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand and quantify the resilience of the infrastructure to external stressors, which is essential for developing efficient climate change adaptation strategies. To accomplish this, robust fragility and other vulnerability models are necessary. These models are employed to assess the level of asset damage and to quantify losses for given hazard intensity measures. In this context, a comprehensive literature review is carried out to shed light on existing fragility models specific to the transmission network, distribution network, and substations. The review is organized into three main sections: damage assessment, fragility curves, and recommendations for climate change adaptation. The first section provides a comprehensive review of past incidents, their causes, and failure modes. The second section reviews analytical and empirical fragility models, emphasizing the need for further research on compound and non-compound hazards, especially windstorms, floods, lightning, and wildfires. Finally, the third section examines risk mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of climate change. This review aims to improve the understanding of approaches to enhance the resilience of power grid assets in the face of climate change. These insights are valuable to various stakeholders, including risk analysts and policymakers, who are involved in risk modeling and developing adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>PQG-DL-Ekman: a triple-deck boundary layer theory for large-scale atmospheric flow with moist process closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced mathematical models for atmospheric dynamics at various scales have a long and rich history. However, versions of such models that explicitly incorporate moisture and phase changes have been developed only fairly recently. This work merges one of said modeling innovations, namely Smith and Stechmann's \emph{precipitating quasigeostrophic} (PQG) model family, with a triple-deck boundary layer theory due to Klein et al.~that extends the classical QG-Ekman theory by an intermediate \emph{diabatic layer} (DL). A detailed analysis of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and Kessler-type bulk microphysics closures is included in the systematic derivation of the resulting PQG-DL-Ekman theory. Furthermore, to illustrate some of the model's properties, explicit axisymmetric solutions of the precipitating diabatic layer equations are derived and combined with numerical sample solutions for the bulk flow.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Phase Changes in Aircraft Exhaust: A Computational Study on Early Contrail Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical framework is developed to model contrail formation in the near-field exhaust of aircraft engines, resolving non-equilibrium phase transitions in compressible, multi-component, non-ideal fluid flows. The approach combines well-established methods from steam turbine modeling for liquid-phase transitions with cloud microphysics models for ice formation. It resolves homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, interphase momentum exchange, and polydispersed size distributions of droplets, ice crystals, and soot particles. These models are implemented in a parallelized finite-volume solver and applied to a high-bypass turbofan exhaust configuration with simplified geometry. Results indicate that non-equilibrium effects strongly influence condensation and freezing dynamics, while nozzle geometry and water vapor content modulate local supersaturation and phase transition pathways. The findings underscore the limitations of equilibrium-based models and highlight the value of physics-based, scalable tools for analyzing contrail formation across fuels and propulsion systems.</description>
