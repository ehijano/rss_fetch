      <title>Systemic Risk Radar: A Multi-Layer Graph Framework for Early Market Crash Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial crises emerge when structural vulnerabilities accumulate across sectors, markets, and investor behavior. Predicting these systemic transitions is challenging because they arise from evolving interactions between market participants, not isolated price movements alone. We present Systemic Risk Radar (SRR), a framework that models financial markets as multi-layer graphs to detect early signs of systemic fragility and crash-regime transitions.
  We evaluate SRR across three major crises: the Dot-com crash, the Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 shock. Our experiments compare snapshot GNNs, a simplified temporal GNN prototype, and standard baselines (logistic regression and Random Forest). Results show that structural network information provides useful early-warning signals compared to feature-based models alone.
  This correlation-based instantiation of SRR demonstrates that graph-derived features capture meaningful changes in market structure during stress events. The findings motivate extending SRR with additional graph layers (sector/factor exposure, sentiment) and more expressive temporal architectures (LSTM/GRU or Transformer encoders) to better handle diverse crisis types.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ratcheting of Dividends with Irreversible Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurance company that faces two key constraints: a ratcheting dividend constraint and an irreversible reinsurance constraint. The company allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders while strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting dividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The irreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot be prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate and reinsurance level are modeled as nondecreasing processes, thereby satisfying the constraints. Claims are modeled using a Brownian risk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and dividend levels are restricted to a finite set. The optimal value function is shown to be the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A threshold strategy is constructed and shown to be optimal. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimality conditions and optimal strategies.</description>
