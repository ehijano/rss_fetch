      <title>Eliminating Phase Misalignments in Cell-Free Massive MIMO via Differential Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two approaches for overcoming access points' phase misalignment effects in the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems. The first approach is based on the differential space-time block coding technique, while the second one is based on the use of differential modulation schemes. Both approaches are shown to perform exceptionally well and to restore system performance in CF-mMIMO systems where phase alignment at the access points for downlink joint coherent transmission cannot be achieved.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear time decoding of RS and AG codes for burst errors up to the Singleton bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite of tremendous research on decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) and algebraic geometry (AG) codes under the random and adversary substitution error models, few studies have explored these codes under the burst substitution error model. Burst errors are prevalent in many communication channels, such as wireless networks, magnetic recording systems, and flash memory. Compared to random and adversarial errors, burst errors often allow for the design of more efficient decoding algorithms. However, achieving both an optimal decoding radius and quasi-linear time complexity for burst error correction remains a significant challenge. The goal of this paper is to design (both list and probabilistic unique) decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes that achieve the Singleton bound for decoding radius while maintaining quasi-linear time complexity.
  Our idea is to build a one-to-one correspondence between AG codes (including RS codes) and interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths (or even constant lengths). By decoding the interleaved RS codes with burst errors, we derive efficient decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes. For decoding interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths, we can employ either the naive methods or existing algorithms. This one-to-one correspondence is constructed using the generalized fast Fourier transform (G-FFT) proposed by Li and Xing (SODA 2024). The G-FFT generalizes the divide-and-conquer technique from polynomials to algebraic function fields. More precisely speaking, assume that our AG code is defined over a function field $E$ which has a sequence of subfields $\mathbb{F}_q(x)=E_r\subseteq E_{r-1}\subseteq \cdots\subset E_1\subseteq E_0=E$ such that $E_{i-1}/E_i$ are Galois extensions for $1\le i\le r$. Then the AG code based on $E$ can be transformed into an interleaved RS code over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Aided Robust Secure Transmission for RSMA-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages fluid antenna (FA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. We consider a practical multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) system, where a base station (BS) equipped with fixed position antennas (FPAs) employs RSMA to communicate with multiple single-FA users, while an eavesdropping target may potentially wiretap the signals. The system adopts a novel rate splitting (RS) scheme, where the common layer stream serves a dual purpose: it conveys valid data to legitimate users (LUs) while simultaneously generating jamming signals to confuse potential eavesdroppers. We establish the problem and propose the optimization algorithm under two conditions: perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. Specifically, under perfect the CSI condition, we address the non-convex optimization problem by proposing an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the problem into two subproblems: beamforming matrix optimization and the adjustment of FA positions. For beamforming optimization, we utilize semidefinite programming (SDP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to convert the problem into a more tractable convex form. Given a fixed beamforming matrix, SCA is applied to handle the surrogate upper bound of the constraints. In the case of imperfect CSI, the continuous nature of CSI errors leads to an infinite number of constraints. To overcome this challenge, we propose an AO-based algorithm that incorporates the S-Procedure and SCA to obtain a high-quality beamforming matrix and effective FA positions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FA-aided RSMA-ISAC system significantly enhances security compared to traditional FPA-based and SDMA-based systems.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Finite Constellations, Receiver Design, and SIC-free Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</description>

      <title>Flag Sequence Set Design for Low-Complexity Delay-Doppler Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies Flag sequences for low-complexity delay-Doppler estimation by exploiting their distinctive peak-curtain ambiguity functions (AFs). Unlike the existing Flag sequence designs that are limited to prime lengths and periodic auto-AFs, we aim to design Flag sequence sets of arbitrary lengths with low (nontrivial) periodic/aperiodic auto- and cross-AFs. Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the weighted integrated masked sidelobe level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated parallel partially majorization-minimization algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and the sampling bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization with Reconfigurable Surfaces: General Models, Theoretical Limits, and Effective Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We envision a future in which multi-antenna technology effectively exploits the spatial domain as a set of non-interfering orthogonal resources, allowing for flexible resource allocation and efficient modulation/demodulation. We may refer to this paradigm as orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM). On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology which allows shaping the propagation environment for improved performance. This paper studies the ability of three extended types of reconfigurable surface (RS), including the recently proposed beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to achieve perfectly orthogonal channels in a general multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario. We consider practical implementations for the three types of RS consisting of passive components, and obtain the corresponding restrictions on their reconfigurability. We then use these restrictions to derive closed-form conditions and explicit expressions for achieving arbitrary (orthogonal) channels. We also study the problem of exploiting the degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the channel orthogonality constraint to maximize the channel gain while maintaining the passive RS constraints, and we propose some initial methods with satisfying performance. Finally, we provide some channel estimation and RS configuration techniques within this framework, where the computations are assumed to be performed at the BS, and we derive some limits on the amount of overhead required to achieve channel orthogonalization with RSs. The numerical results confirm the theoretical findings, showing that channel orthogonality with passive RSs can be effectively achieved in practical environments as long as the direct channel is not significant with respect to the RS cascaded channel. We thus take some important steps towards realizing OSDM.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Particularly, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization of AI in different physical-layer (PHY) tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse PHY tasks requires extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task PHY network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM, by exploiting the excellent semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish different tasks. The proposed design allows different wireless data types to be well aligned with the LLM input format. Moreover, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is utilized for LLM fine-tuning. To reduce the memory requirement during LLM fine-tuning, a LoRA fine-tuning-aware quantization method is introduced. Extensive numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Variable-Rate CSI Reconstruction for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, acquiring channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) traditionally relies on limited feedback from mobile terminals (MTs). However, the accuracy of channel reconstruction from feedback CSI is inherently constrained by the rate-distortion trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-modal channel reconstruction framework that leverages auxiliary data, such as RGB images or uplink CSI, collected at the BS. By integrating contextual information from these modalities, the framework mitigates CSI distortions caused by noise, compression, and quantization. At its core, the framework utilizes an autoencoder network capable of generating variable-length CSI, tailored for rate-adaptive multi-modal channel reconstruction. By augmenting the foundational autoencoder network using a transfer learning-based multi-modal fusion strategy, we enable accurate channel reconstruction in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. To train and evaluate the network under diverse and realistic wireless conditions, we construct a synthetic dataset that pairs wireless channel data with sensor data through 3D modeling and ray tracing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in 5G New Radio (5G NR)-compliant scenarios, highlighting the potential of sensor data integration to improve CSI reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly nontrivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential synergy between quantum communications and future wireless communication systems is explored. By proposing a quantum-native or quantum-by-design philosophy, the survey examines technologies such as quantumdomain (QD) multi-input multi-output, QD non-orthogonal multiple access, quantum secure direct communication, QD resource allocation, QD routing, and QD artificial intelligence. The recent research advances in these areas are summarized. Given the behavior of photonic and particle-like Terahertz (THz) systems, a comprehensive system-oriented perspective is adopted to assess the feasibility of using quantum communications in future systems. This survey also reviews quantum optimization algorithms and quantum neural networks to explore the potential integration of quantum communication and quantum computing in future systems. Additionally, the current status of quantum sensing, quantum radar, and quantum timing is briefly reviewed in support of future applications. The associated research gaps and future directions are identified, including extending the entanglement coherence time, developing THz quantum communications devices, addressing challenges in channel estimation and tracking, and establishing the theoretical bounds and performance trade-offs of quantum communication, computing, and sensing. This survey offers a unique perspective on the potential for quantum communications to revolutionize future systems and pave the way for even more advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
