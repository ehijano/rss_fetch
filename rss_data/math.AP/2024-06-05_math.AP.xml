      <title>Higher order asymptotic expansions for the convection-diffusion equation in the Fujita-subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the asymptotic expansions of global solutions to the convection-diffusion equation in the Fujita-subcritical case. We improve the result by Zuazua (1993) and establish higher order asymptotic expansions with decay estimates of the remainders. We also discuss the optimality for the decay rate of the remainder.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of a P\'olya functional for triangles and rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the functional given by the product of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the torsional rigidity of planar domains normalized by the area. This scale invariant functional was studied by P\'olya and Szeg\H{o} in 1951 who showed that it is bounded above by 1 for all domains. It has been conjectured that within the class of bounded convex planar domains the functional is bounded below by $\pi^{2}/24$ and above by $\pi^{2}/12$ and that these bounds are sharp. Remarkably, the conjecture remains open even within the class of triangles. The purpose of this paper is to prove the conjecture in this case. The conjecture is also proved for rectangles where a stronger monotonicity property is verified. Finally, the upper bound also holds for tangential quadrilateral.</description>

      <title>Global existence of solutions to the fully parabolic chemotaxis system with logistic source under nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of global boundedness solutions to the fully parabolic chemotaxis systems with logistic sources, $ru- \mu u^2$, under nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu }= |u|^p$ where $p &gt;1 $ in smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$. A recent study by Le (2023) has shown that the logistic sources can ensure that solutions are global and bounded when $n =2$ with $p &lt; \frac{3}{2}$ and $n=3$ with $p &lt;\frac{7}{5}$. In this paper, we extend the previous findings by demonstrating the existence of global bounded solutions when $p&lt; \frac{3}{2}$ in any spatial dimension $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Large Time Behavior and Sharp Interface Limit of Compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn System for Interacting Shock Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large time behavior and sharp interface limit of the Cauchy problem for compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system with interaction shock waves in the same family. This system is an important mathematical model for describing the motion of immiscible two-phase flow. The results show that, if the initial density and velocity are near the superposition of two shock waves in the same family, then there exists a unique global solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system, and this solution asymptotically converges to the superposition of the viscous shock wave and rarefaction wave which moving in opposite directions. Moreover, this global-in-time solution converges to the entropy solution of $p$-system in $L^\infty$-norm as the thickness of the diffusion interface tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of solutions to semilinear wave equations with spatial derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For small-amplitude semilinear wave equations with power type nonlinearity on the first-order spatial derivative, the expected sharp upper bound on the lifespan of solutions is obtained for both critical cases and subcritical cases, for all spatial dimensions $n&gt;1$. It is achieved uniformly by constructing the integral equations, deriving the ordinary differential inequality system, and iteration argument. Combined with the former works, the sharp lifespan estimates for this problem are completely established, at least for the spherical symmetric case.</description>

      <title>The continuity equation in the Heisenberg-periodic case: a representation formula and an application to Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a representation of the weak solution of the continuity equation on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^1$ with periodic data (the periodicity is suitably adapted to the group law). This solution is the push forward of a measure concentrated on the flux associated with the drift of the continuity equation. Furthermore, we shall use this interpretation for proving that weak solutions to first order Mean Field Games on $\mathbb H^1$ are also mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of a Coupled Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resolvent Estimates for Subwavelength Resonators: The Minnaert Bubble Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonators are small scaled objects that exhibit contrasting medium properties (eigher in intensity or sign) while compared to the ones of a uniform background. Such contrasts allow them to resonate at specific frequencies. There are two ways to mathematically define these resonances. First, as the frequencies for which the related system of integral equations is not injective. Second, as the frequencies for which the related resolvent operator of the natural Hamiltonian has a pole. In this work, we consider, as the subwavelength resonator, the Minneart bubble. We show that these two mentioned definitions are equivalent. Most importantly,
  1. we derive the related resolvent estimates which are uniform in terms of the size/contrast of the resonators. As a by product, we show that the resolvent operators have no resonances in the upper half complex plane while they exhibit two resonances in the lower half plane which converge to the real axis, as the size of the bubble tends to zero. These resonances are related to the Minnaert frequency (which constitutes their dominating real part).
  2. we derive the asymptotic estimates of the generated scattered fields which are uniform in terms of the incident frequency and which are valid everywhere in space (i.e. inside or outside the bubble).
  \end{enumerate} The dominating parts, for both the resolvent operator and the scattered fields, are given by the ones of the point-scatterer supported at the location of the bubble. In particular, these dominant parts are non trivial (not the same as those of the background medium) only if the used incident frequency identifies with the Minnaert one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new numerical scheme for a system that includes evolution equations describing a perfect plasticity model with a time-dependent yield surface. We demonstrate that the solution to the proposed scheme is stable under suitable norms. Moreover, the stability leads to the existence of an exact solution, and we also prove that the solution to the proposed scheme converges strongly to the exact solution under suitable norms.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Formula for Eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian in Domains with a Small Star-shaped Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a spectral problem of the Laplace operator in a two-dimensional bounded domain perforated by a small arbitrary star-shaped hole and on the smooth boundary of which the Neumann boundary condition is imposed. It is proved that the eigenvalues of this problem converge to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian defined on the unperturbed domain as the size of the hole approaches zero. Furthermore, our main theorem provides the rate of convergence by showing an asymptotic expansion for all simple eigenvalues with respect to the size and shape of the hole.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if $X,Y$ are continuous, Sobolev vector fields with bounded divergence on the real plane and $[X,Y]=0$, then their flows commute. In particular, we improve the previous result of Colombo-Tione (2021), where the authors require the additional assumption of the weak Lie differentiability on one of the two flows. We also discuss possible extensions to the $\text{BV}$ setting.</description>

      <title>Periodically modulated solitary waves of the CH-KP-I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the CH-KP-I equation. For this equation we prove the existence of steady solutions, which are solitary in one horizontal direction and periodic in the other. We show that such waves bifurcate from the line solitary wave solutions, i.e. solitary wave solutions to the Camassa-Holm equation, in a dimension-breaking bifurcation. This is achieved through reformulating the problem as a dynamical system for a perturbation of the line solitary wave solutions, where the periodic direction takes the role of time, then applying the Lyapunov-Iooss theorem.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the three dimensional Maxwell-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove global well-posedness for the massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the Lorenz gauge in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, for small, sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data, as well as modified scattering for the solutions. Heuristically we exploit the close connection between the massive Maxwell-Dirac and the wave-Klein-Gordon equations, while developing a novel approach which applies directly at the level of the Dirac equations. The modified scattering result follows from a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions inside the light cone, which we derive via the method of testing with wave packets of Ifrim-Tataru.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: II. The Derivative NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of a two-paper series studying the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we focus on the quasi-periodic Cauchy problem for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey an exponential upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. Also, we prove that, for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a weakly nonlinear setting, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution in the sense of both sup-norm and analytic Sobolev-norm.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and an explicit combinatorial analysis for the Picard iteration with the help of Feynman diagrams and the power of $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ labelling the complex conjugate.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to obtain a positive, smooth, even, and homoclinic to zero (i.e zero at infinity) solution to a non-autonomous, second-order, nonlinear differential equation involving quadratic growth on the derivative. We apply Galerkin's method combined with Strauss' approximation on the term involving the first derivative to obtain weak solutions. We also study the regularity of the solutions and the dependence on their existence with a parameter</description>

      <title>The geometric Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to classify all those versions of the Toda equations which govern the existence of $\tau$-primitive harmonic maps from a surface into a homogeneous space $G/T$ for which $G$ is a noncomplex noncompact simple real Lie group and $T$ is a maximal compact torus, i.e., a maximal torus inside a maximal compact subgroup $H &lt; G$. Here $\tau$ is the Coxeter automorphism which Drinfel'd &amp; Sokolov assigned to each affine Dynkin diagram. This allows $\tau$ to be either an inner or an outer automorphism. We show that, up to equivalence, the real forms $G&lt;G^\mathbb{C}$ which are compatible with $\tau$ can be classified using a simple labelling of the corresponding affine diagram.
  The second purpose is to establish when stability criteria can be used to prove the existence of solutions. We interpret the Toda equations over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ as equations for a metric on a holomorphic principal $T^\mathbb{C}$-bundle $Q^\mathbb{C}$ over $\Sigma$. The corresponding Chern connection, when combined with a holomorphic field $\varphi$, produces a $G$-connection which is flat precisely when the Toda equations hold. We call the pair $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ a Toda pair. We classify those real forms of the Toda equations for which the Toda pair is a principal pair (in the sense of Bradlow et al.) and we call these totally noncompact Toda pairs. Using the stability theory for principal pairs we prove that for totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ the corresponding Toda equations always admit solutions. Every solution to the geometric Toda equations has a corresponding $G$-Higgs bundle. We explain how to construct this $G$-Higgs bundle directly from the Toda pair and show that Baraglia's cyclic Higgs bundles arise from a very special case of totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs.</description>

      <title>Integral curvature estimates for solutions to Ricci flow with $L^p$ bounded scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove $\textit{localised, weighted}$ curvature integral estimates for solutions to the Ricci flow in the setting of a smooth four dimensional Ricci flow or a closed $n$-dimensional K\"ahler Ricci flow. These integral estimates improve and extend the integral curvature estimates shown by the second author in an earlier paper. If the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded in the spatial $L^p$ sense for some $p&gt;2,$ then the estimates imply a uniform bound on the spatial $L^2$ norm of the Riemannian curvature tensor. Stronger integral estimates are shown to hold if one further assumes a weak non-inflating condition. In a sequel paper, we show that in many natural settings, a non-inflating condition holds.</description>

      <title>Second-order optimality conditions for the sparse optimal control of nonviscous Cahn-Hilliard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the optimal control of an initial-boundary value problem for the classical nonviscous Cahn-Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions. Phase field systems of this type govern the evolution of diffusive phase transition processes with conserved order parameter. For such systems, optimal control problems have been studied in the past. We focus here on the situation when the cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a sparsity-enhancing nondifferentiable term like the L1-norm. For such cases, we establish first-order necessary and second-order sufficient optimality conditions for locally optimal controls, where in the approach to second-order sufficient conditions we employ a technique introduced by E. Casas, C. Ryll and F. Tr\"oltzsch in the paper [SIAM J. Control Optim. 53 (2015), 2168-2202]. The main novelty of this paper is that this method, which has recently been successfully applied to systems of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type, can be adapted also to the classical nonviscous case. Since in the case without viscosity the solutions to the state and adjoint systems turn out to be considerably less regular than in the viscous case, numerous additional technical difficulties have to be overcome, and additional conditions have to be imposed. In particular, we have to restrict ourselves to the case when the nonlinearity driving the phase separation is regular, while in the presence of a viscosity term also nonlinearities of logarithmic type turn could be admitted. In addition, the implicit function theorem, which was employed to establish the needed differentiability properties of the control-to-state operator in the viscous case, does not apply in our situation and has to be substituted by other arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result of Cheng states that the bottom spectrum of complete manifolds of fixed dimension and Ricci curvature lower bound achieves its maximal value on the corresponding hyperbolic space. The paper establishes an analogous result for three-dimensional complete manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound subject to some necessary topological assumptions. The rigidity issue is also addressed and a splitting theorem is obtained for such manifolds with the maximal bottom spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fire blight is a bacterial plant disease that affects apple and pear trees. We present a mathematical model for its spread in an orchard during bloom. This is a PDE-ODE coupled system, consisting of two semilinear PDEs for the pathogen, coupled to a system of three ODEs for the stationary hosts. Exploratory numerical simulations suggest the existence of travelling waves, which we subsequently prove, under some conditions on parameters, using the method of upper and lower bounds and Schauder's fixed point theorem. Our results are likely not optimal in the sense that our constraints on parameters, which can be interpreted biologically, are sufficient for the existence of travelling waves, but probably not necessary. Possible implications for fire blight biology and management are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of duality solution for a single or a system of transport equations in spaces of probability measures reminiscent of the viscosity solution notion for nonlinear parabolic equations. Our notion of solution by duality is, under suitable assumptions, equivalent to gradient flow solutions in case the single/system of equations has this structure. In contrast, we can deal with a quite general system of nonlinear nonlocal, diffusive or not, system of PDEs without any variational structure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the strong ill-posedness in the sense of Hadamard of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations in $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ without boundary, extending to the case of systems the method that Shikh Khalil \&amp; Elgindi arXiv:2207.04556v1 developed for scalar equations. We provide a large class of initial data with velocity and density of small $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ size, for which the horizontal density gradient has a strong $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm inflation in infinitesimal time, while the vorticity and the vertical density gradient remain bounded. Furthermore, exploiting the three-dimensional version of Elgindi's decomposition of the Biot-Savart law, we apply the method to the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with swirl and away from the vertical axis, showing that a large class of initial data with velocity field uniformly bounded in $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ provides a solution whose swirl component has a strong $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm inflation in infinitesimal time, while the potential vorticity remains bounded at least for small times. Finally, the $W^{1,\infty}$-norm inflation of the swirl (and the $L^{\infty}$-norm inflation of the vorticity field) is quantified from below by an explicit lower bound which depends on time, the size of the data and it is valid for small times.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider three-dimensional steady water waves with vorticity, under the action of gravity and surface tension; in particular we consider so-called Beltrami flows, for which the velocity field and the vorticity are collinear. We discuss a recent variational formulation of the problem which involves a generalisation of the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator. We study this operator in detail, extending some well-known results for the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator, such as the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, the computation of its differential and the asymptotic expansion of its associated symbol. A new formulation of the problem as a single equation for the wave profile is also presented and discussed in a similar vein. As an application of these results we rigorously prove existence of doubly periodic gravity-capillary steady waves and construct approximate doubly periodic gravity steady waves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a self-consistent Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations which describes the longitudinal dynamics of an electron bunch in the storage ring of a synchrotron particle accelerator. We show existence and uniqueness of global classical solutions under physical hypotheses on the initial data. The proof relies on a mild formulation of the equation and hypoelliptic regularization estimates. We also address the problem of the long-time behavior of solutions. We prove the existence of steady states, called Haissinski solutions, given implicitly by a nonlinear integral equation. When the beam current (i.e. the nonlinearity) is small enough, we show uniqueness of steady state and local asymptotic nonlinear stability of solutions in appropriate weighted Lebesgue spaces. The proof is based on hypocoercivity estimates. Finally, we discuss the physical derivation of the equation and its particular asymmetric interaction potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and discuss the properties of a class of cost functions on the sphere which we term defective cost functions. We then discuss how to extend these definitions and some properties to cost functions defined on Euclidean space and on surfaces embedded in Euclidean space. Some important properties of defective cost functions are that they result in Optimal Transport mappings which map to points along geodesics, have a nonzero mixed Hessian term, among other important properties. We also compute the cost-sectional curvature for a broad class of cost functions, to verify and some known examples of cost functions and easily prove positive cost-sectional curvature for some new cost functions. Finally, we discuss how we can construct a regularity theory for defective cost functions by satisfying the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) conditions on an appropriately defined domain. As we develop the regularity theory of defective cost functions, we discuss how the results apply to a particular instance of the far-field lens refractor problem.</description>

      <title>Existence of a global fundamental solution for H\"ormander operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their celebrated paper of 1976, Rothschild and Stein prove a lifting procedure that locally reduces to a free Lie algebra any family of smooth vector fields $X_1,\dots,X_q$, over a manifold $M$ respecting the H\"ormander's condition. Then, a large class of differential operators can be lifted, and they find that fundamental solutions on the lifted space can be re-projected to fundamental solutions of the given operator on $M$. In case that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g=\mbox{Lie}(X_1,\dots,X_q)$ is finite dimensional but not nilpotent, this procedure could introduce a strong tilting of the space. In this paper we represent a global construction of a Lie group $G$ associated to $\mathfrak g$ that avoid this tilting problem. In particular $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$ and a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. We prove that for any simply connected manifold $M$ -- and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds -- the existence of a fundamental solution for a differential operator $L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$, follows via a saturation method from the existence of a fundamental solution for the associated lifted operator over a group $G$. This is a generalization of Biagi and Bonfiglioli analogous result for homogeneous vector fields over $M=\mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Continuity of attractors of parabolic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions and rapidly varying boundaries. The case of a Lipschitz deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the continuity of attractors for nonlinear parabolic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions when the boundary of the domain varies very rapidly as a parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero. We consider the case where the boundary of the domain presents a highly oscillatory behavior as the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero. For the case where we have a Lipschitz deformation of the boundary with the Lipschitz constant uniformly bounded in $\epsilon$ but the boundaries do not approach in a Lipschitz sense, the solutions of these equations converge in certain sense to the solution of a limit parabolic equation of the same type but where the boundary condition has a factor that captures the oscillations of the boundary. To address this problem, it is necessary to consider the notion of convergence of functions defined in varying domains and the convergence of a family of operators defined in different Banach spaces. Moreover, since we consider problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, it is necessary to extend these concepts to the case of spaces with negative exponents and to operators defined between these spaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates of macroscopic quantities generated by the solutions to linear transport equations driven by a general family of Hamiltonians. The associated particle trajectories are all trapped in a compact region of phase-space and feature a non-degenerate elliptic stagnation point. The analysis covers a large class of Hamiltonians generated by the radially symmetric compactly supported equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system. Working in radial symmetry, our analysis features both the 1+2-dimensional case and the harder 1+1-dimensional case, where all the particles have the same value of the modulus of angular momentum. The latter case is also of importance in both the plasma physics case and two dimensional incompressible fluid flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.05595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to derive volume and other geometric information for three-dimensional complete manifolds with positive scalar curvature. In the case that the Ricci curvature is nonnegative, it is shown that the volume of the manifold must be of linear growth when the scalar curvature is bounded from below by a positive constant. This answers a question of Gromov in the affirmative for dimension three. Volume growth estimates are also obtained for the case when scalar curvature decays to zero. In fact, results of similar nature are established for the more general case that the Ricci curvature is asymptotically nonnegative.</description>

Abstract: In any 5 dimensional closed Sasakian manifold we prove that any minmax operation on the area among Legendrian surfaces is achieved by a continuous conformal Legendrian map from a closed riemann surface $S$ into $N^5$ equipped with an integer multiplicity bounded in $L^\infty$. Moreover this map, equipped with this multiplicity, satisfies a weak version of the Hamiltonian Minimal Equation. We conjecture that any solution to this equation is a smooth branched Legendrian immersion away from isolated Schoen-Wolfson conical singularities with non zero Maslov class.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of a spectral triple to that of a higher-order relative spectral triple, which accommodates several types of hypoelliptic differential operators on manifolds with boundary. The bounded transform of a higher-order relative spectral triple gives rise to a relative K-homology cycle. In the case of an elliptic differential operator on a compact smooth manifold with boundary, we calculate the K-homology boundary map of the constructed relative K-homology cycle to obtain a generalization of the Baum-Douglas-Taylor index theorem.</description>

      <title>On particle systems and critical strengths of general singular interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite interacting particle systems with strong repulsing-attracting or general interactions, we prove global weak well-posedness almost up to the critical threshold of the strengths of attracting interactions (independent of the number of particles), and establish other regularity results, such as a heat kernel bound in the regions where strongly attracting particles are close to each other. Our main analytic instruments are a variant of De Giorgi's method in $L^p$ and an abstract desingularization theorem.</description>
