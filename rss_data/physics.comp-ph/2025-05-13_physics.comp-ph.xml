      <title>$\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN: A Scalable Graph Neural Network Framework with Hierarchical Matrix Acceleration for Simulation of Large-Scale Particulate Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and scalable framework, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and hierarchical matrix ($\mathcal{H}$-matrix) techniques, for simulating large-scale particulate suspensions, which have broader impacts across science and engineering. The framework draws on the Hydrodynamic Interaction Graph Neural Network (HIGNN) that employs GNNs to model the mobility tensor governing particle motion under hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) and external forces. HIGNN offers several advantages: it effectively captures both short- and long-range HIs and their many-body nature; it realizes a substantial speedup over traditional methodologies, by requiring only a forward pass through its neural networks at each time step; it provides explainability beyond black-box neural network models, through direct correspondence between graph connectivity and physical interactions; and it demonstrates transferability across different systems, irrespective of particles' number, concentration, configuration, or external forces. While HIGNN provides significant speedup, the quadratic scaling of its overall prediction cost (with respect to the total number of particles), due to intrinsically slow-decaying two-body HIs, limits its scalability. To achieve superior efficiency across all scales, in the present work we integrate $\mathcal{H}$-matrix techniques into HIGNN, reducing the prediction cost scaling to quasi-linear. Through comprehensive evaluations, we validate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's accuracy, and demonstrate its quasi-linear scalability and superior computational efficiency. It requires only minimal computing resources; for example, a single mid-range GPU is sufficient for a system containing 10 million particles. Finally, we demonstrate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's ability to efficiently simulate practically relevant large-scale suspensions of both particles and flexible filaments.</description>

      <title>Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting fine-tuned open-source large language models (LLMs), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem for AI-enhanced computational chemistry. This intelligent assistant is going to be integrated into the Aitomistic Hub and XACS online computing services, with some functionality already publicly available as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Matched Asymptotic Expansions-Based Transferable Neural Networks for Singular Perturbation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by utilizing the theory of matched asymptotic expansions, an efficient and accurate neural network method, named as "MAE-TransNet", is developed for solving singular perturbation problems in general dimensions, whose solutions usually change drastically in some narrow boundary layers. The TransNet is a two-layer neural network with specially pre-trained hidden-layer neurons. In the proposed MAE-TransNet, the inner and outer solutions produced from the matched asymptotic expansions are first approximated by a TransNet with nonuniform hidden-layer neurons and a TransNet with uniform hidden-layer neurons, respectively. Then, these two solutions are combined with a matching term to obtain the composite solution, which approximates the asymptotic expansion solution of the singular perturbation problem. This process enables the MAE-TransNet method to retain the precision of the matched asymptotic expansions while maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of TransNet. Meanwhile, the rescaling of the sharp region allows the same pre-trained network parameters to be applied to boundary layers with various thicknesses, thereby improving the transferability of the method. Notably, for coupled boundary layer problems, a computational framework based on MAE-TransNet is also constructed to effectively address issues resulting from the lack of relevant matched asymptotic expansion theory in such problems. Our MAE-TransNet is compared with TransNet, PINN, and Boundary-Layer PINN on various benchmark problems including 1D linear and nonlinear problems with boundary layers, the 2D Couette flow problem, a 2D coupled boundary layer problem, and the 3D Burgers vortex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that MAE-TransNet significantly outperforms other neural network methods in capturing the characteristics of boundary layers, improving the accuracy, and reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on MR-TADF Materials Based on CzBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials have garnered significant research interest owing to their remarkably narrow emission spectra with full width at half maximum (FWHM) below $40~\text{nm}$, demonstrating substantial advantages over conventional donor-acceptor (D--A) type TADF materials in spectral purity. However, conventional N--B--N resonant framework materials are fundamentally constrained by their intrinsically low reverse intersystem crossing rates ($k_{\text{RISC}} &lt; 10^{3}~\text{s}^{-1}$), presenting a persistent challenge for achieving high-efficiency TADF. This study proposes a triple collaborative design strategy based on CzBN to break through this limitation: (1) Enhance the separation of HOMO and LUMO by $\pi$-conjugation expansion and reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (2) Introduce O/S heteroatoms to control the excited state charge transfer (CT) characteristics and further reduce $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$; (3) Enhance the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect through the synergy of extended $\pi$-system and heteroatoms. Based on this, five new MR-TADF molecules were designed and studied. Among them, the $k_{\text{RISC}}$ of CzBN\_S reached $3.48 \times 10^{6}~\text{s}^{-1}$, two orders of magnitude higher than CzBN, while maintaining $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} &lt; 0.1~\text{eV}$ and FWHM at $40~\text{nm}$.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Equivariant graph neural network surrogates for predicting the properties of relaxed atomic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations determine the relaxed atomic positions and lattice parameters that minimize the formation energy of a structure. We present an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) model to predict the outcome of DFT calculations for structures of interest. Cluster expansions are a well established approach for representing the formation energies. However, traditional cluster expansions are limited in their ability to handle variations from a fixed lattice, including interstitial atoms, amorphous materials, and materials with multiple structures. EGNNs offer a more flexible framework that inherently respects the symmetry of the system without being reliant on a particular lattice. In this work, we present the mathematical framework and the results of training for lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) at various compositions of lithium and arrangements of the lithium atoms. Our results demonstrate that the EGNN can accurately predict quantities outside the training set including the largest atomic displacements, the strain tensor and energy, and the formation energy providing greater insight into the system being studied without the need for more DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Resonance phenomena of thermo-bioconvection generated by chemotactic bacteria under unsteady heat condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioconvection is a phenomenon caused by microorganisms with tactic properties. To effectively utilize bioconvection for industrial purposes, it is necessary to find a way to control it. In this study, we performed a three-dimensional numerical analysis of thermo-bioconvection generated by a suspension of chemotactic bacteria under unsteady heating conditions at the bottom. Under unsteady heating conditions, thermal convection and bioconvection coexist, and unsteady thermo-bioconvection occurs around plumes. When the frequency of the temperature fluctuation is low, thermo-bioconvection follows the temperature fluctuation. However, as the frequency increases, the ability of thermo-bioconvection to follow the temperature fluctuation deteriorates. A resonance phenomenon occurs at the frequency where the instability of the suspension owing to the density difference between the bacteria and water is maintained and where thermo-bioconvection can follow temperature fluctuations. At the resonance frequency, the transport characteristics of bacteria and oxygen throughout the entire region within the suspension improve significantly. As the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number increase, the interference between thermal convection and bioconvection intensifies, leading to a noticeable improvement in transport characteristics owing to the resonance phenomenon. At this time, the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number do not almost affect the resonance frequency. This study demonstrated the possibility of thermal control of transport properties in bioconvection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and hybrid reduced order models to mitigate Kolmogorov barrier in a multiscale kinetic transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop reduced order models (ROMs) to predict solutions to a multiscale kinetic transport equation with a diffusion limit under the parametric setting. When the underlying scattering effect is not sufficiently strong, the system governed by this equation exhibits transport-dominated behavior. Suffering from the Kolmogorov barrier for transport-dominant problems, classical linear ROMs may become inefficient in this regime. To address this issue, we first develop a piecewise linear ROM by introducing a novel goal-oriented adaptive time partitioning strategy. To avoid local over-refinement or under-refinement, we propose an adaptive coarsening and refinement strategy that remains robust with various initial empirical partitions. Additionally, for problems where a local linear approximation is not sufficiently efficient, we further develop a hybrid ROM, which combines autoencoder-based nonlinear ROMs and piecewise linear ROMs. Compared to previous autoencoder-based ROMs, this hybridized method reduces the offline autoencoder's training cost by only applying it to time intervals that are adaptively identified as the most challenging. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches successfully predict full-order solutions at unseen parameter values with both efficiency and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the Kolmogorov barrier for multiscale kinetic transport problems with the coexistence of both transport- and diffusion-dominant behaviors.</description>

      <title>Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon, has attracted significant interest for its electronic and mechanical properties, alongside its compatibility with various substrates. In this study, we investigate the structural and elastic characteristics of silicene using molecular dynamics simulations based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian, calibrated to align with density-functional theory calculations. We focus particularly on the material's elastic properties and mechanical stability, analyzing its behavior under extensive compressive and tensile in-plane stresses and across temperatures up to 1000 K. Key properties examined include in-plane area, Si--Si bond length, atomic mean-square displacements, elastic constants, and 2D compression modulus. Our findings reveal a notable reduction in stiffness elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, and compression modulus with increasing temperature. Additionally, we identify mechanical instabilities in the silicene structure at specific compressive and tensile biaxial stresses, signaling the material's stability limits or spinodal points. At the corresponding spinodal pressures, structural and elastic properties exhibit anomalies or divergences.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing initial pressure and speed of sound distributions simultaneously in photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography relies on an accurate knowledge of the speed of sound in the target. However, the speed of sound distribution is not generally known, which may result in artefacts in the reconstructed distribution of initial pressure. Therefore, reconstructing the speed of sound simultaneously with the initial pressure would be valuable for accurate imaging in photoacoustic tomography. Furthermore, the speed of sound distribution could provide additional valuable information about the imaged target. In this work, simultaneous reconstruction of initial pressure and speed of sound in photoacoustic tomography is studied. This inverse problem is known to be highly ill-posed. To overcome this, we study an approach where the ill-posedness is alleviated by utilising multiple photoacoustic data sets that are generated by different initial pressure distributions within the same imaged target. Then, these initial pressure distributions are reconstructed simultaneously with the speed of sound distribution. A methodology for solving this minimisation problem is formulated using a gradient-based iterative approach equipped with bound constraints and a multigrid approach. The methodology was evaluated with numerical simulations. Different approaches for generating multiple initial pressure distributions and their effect on the solution of the image reconstruction problem were studied. The results show that initial pressure and speed of sound can be simultaneously reconstructed from photoacoustic data. Furthermore, utilising multiple initial pressure distributions improves the reconstructions such that the locations of initial pressure and speed of sound inhomogeneities can be better distinguished and image artifacts are reduced.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential to solve certain complex problems, yet, scaling monolithic processors remains a major challenge. Modular and distributed architectures are proposed to build large-scale quantum systems while bringing the security advantages of quantum communication. At present, this requires accurate and computationally efficient models of quantum links across different scales to advance system design and guide experimental prototyping. In this work, we review protocols and models for estimating latency, losses, and fidelity in quantum communication primitives relying on quantum state distribution via microwave photons. We also propose a scalable simulation framework to support the design and evaluation of future distributed quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Robust computation of higher-dimensional invariant tori from individual trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for computing invariant tori of dimension greater than one. The method uses a single short trajectory of a dynamical system without any continuation or initial guesses. No preferred coordinate system is required, meaning the method is practical for physical systems where the user does not have much \textit{a priori} knowledge. Three main tools are used to obtain the rotation vector of the invariant torus: the reduced rank extrapolation method, Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation, and a Korkine-Zolatarev lattice basis reduction. The parameterization of the torus is found via a least-squares approach. The robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by accurately computing many two-dimensional invariant tori of a standard map example. Examples of islands and three-dimensional invariant tori are shown as well.</description>

      <title>One-Cell Inversion for Solving Higher-Order Time-Dependent Radiation Transport on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find deterministic solutions to the transient discrete-ordinates neutron-transport equation, source iterations (SI) are typically used to lag the scattering (and fission) source terms from subsequent iterations. For Cartesian geometries in one dimension, SI is parallel over the number of angles but not spatial cells; this is a disadvantage for many-core compute architectures like graphics processing units. One-cell inversion (OCI) is a class of alternative iterative methods that allow space-parallel radiation transport on heterogeneous compute architectures. For OCI, previous studies have shown that, in steady-state computations, spectral radius tends to unity when cells are optically thin regardless of the scattering ratio. In this work, we analyze how the convergence rate of an OCI scheme behaves when used for time-dependent neutron transport computations. We derive a second-order space-time discretization method from the simple corner balance and multiple balance time discretization schemes and show via Fourier analysis that it is unconditionally stable through time. Then, we derive and numerically solve the Fourier systems for both OCI and SI splittings of our discretization, showing that small mean-free times improve the spectral radius of OCI more than SI, and that spectral radius for OCI tends to zero as mean free time gets smaller. We extend both solvers to be energy dependent (using the multigroup assumption) and implement on an AMD MI250X using vendor-supplied batched LAPACK solvers. Smaller time steps improve the relative performance of OCI over SI, and, even when OCI requires more iterations to converge a problem, those iterations can be done much faster on a GPU. This leads to OCI performing better overall than SI on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy -- giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions -- this approach is extended to now include the vertex derived in that work to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization function. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Green's function in the vertex, enabling a fully abinitio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization function, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward, clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted, and has the same dimensionality as the conventional BSE kernel used in standard many-body theory implementations, but is now itself frequency dependent. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.</description>

      <title>AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Fast-Slow Neural Networks for Learning Singularly Perturbed Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed dynamical systems play a crucial role in climate dynamics and plasma physics. A powerful and well-known tool to address these systems is the Fenichel normal form, which significantly simplifies fast dynamics near slow manifolds through a transformation. However, this normal form is difficult to realize in conventional numerical algorithms. In this work, we explore an alternative way of realizing it through structure-preserving machine learning. Specifically, a fast-slow neural network (FSNN) is proposed for learning data-driven models of singularly perturbed dynamical systems with dissipative fast timescale dynamics. Our method enforces the existence of a trainable, attracting invariant slow manifold as a hard constraint. Closed-form representation of the slow manifold enables efficient integration on the slow time scale and significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond the training data. We demonstrate the FSNN on examples including the Grad moment system, two-scale Lorenz96 equations, and Abraham-Lorentz dynamics modeling radiation reaction of electrons.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow: An AI-driven materials inverse design workflow to explore possible high-temperature superconductors</title>

Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>
