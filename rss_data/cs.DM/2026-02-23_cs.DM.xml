      <title>On Large Induced Outerplanar Subgraphs in $2$-Outerplanar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Borradaile, Le and Sherman-Bennett [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2017] proved that every $n$-vertex $2$-outerplane graph has a set of at least $2n/3$ vertices that induces an outerplane graph. We identify a major flaw in their proof and recover their result with a different, and unfortunately much more complex, proof.</description>

      <title>Complexity lower bounds for succinct binary structures of bounded clique-width with restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Rice-like complexity lower bound for any MSO-definable problem on binary structures succinctly encoded by circuits. This work extends the framework recently developed as a counterpoint to Courcelle's theorem for graphs encoded by circuits, in two interplaying directions: (1) by allowing multiple binary relations, and (2) by restricting the interpretation of new symbols. Depending on the pair of an MSO problem $\psi$ and an MSO restriction $\chi$, the problem is proven to be NP-hard or coNP-hard or P-hard, as long as $\psi$ is non-trivial on structures satisfying $\chi$ with bounded clique-width. Indeed, there are P-complete problems (for logspace reductions) in our extended context. Finally, we strengthen a previous result on the necessity to parameterize the notion of non-triviality, hence supporting the choice of clique-width.</description>

      <title>Recoverable systems and the maximal hard-core model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper (arXiv:2510.19746), we have studied the maximal hard-code model on the square lattice ${\mathbb Z}^2$ from the perspective of recoverable systems. Here we extend this study to the case of the triangular lattice ${\mathbb A}$. The following results are obtained:
  (1) We derive bounds on the capacity of the associated recoverable system on ${\mathbb A}$;
  (2) We show non-uniqueness of Gibbs measures in the high-activity regime;
  (3) We characterize extremal periodic Gibbs measures for sufficiently low values of activity.</description>

      <title>Generating minimal redundant and maximal irredundant sets in incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proved by Boros and Makino that there is no output-polynomial-time algorithm enumerating the minimal redundant sets or the maximal irredundant sets of a hypergraph, unless P=NP. The same question was left open for graphs, with only a few tractable cases known to date. In this paper, we focus on graph classes that capture incidence relations such as bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs. Concerning maximal irredundant sets, we show that the problem on co-bipartite graphs is as hard as in general graphs and tractable in split and strongly orderable graphs, the latter being a generalization of chordal bipartite graphs. As for minimal redundant sets enumeration, we first show that the problem is intractable in split and co-bipartite graphs, answering the aforementioned open question, and that it is tractable on $(C_3,C_5,C_6,C_8)$-free graphs, a class of graphs incomparable to strongly orderable graphs, and which also generalizes chordal bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Polytopes of alternating sign matrices with dihedral-subgroup symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convex hulls of the eight dihedral symmetry classes of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices, i.e., ASMs invariant under a subgroup of the symmetry group of the square. Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chv\'atal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism for Tournaments of Small Twin Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that isomorphism of tournaments of twin width at most $k$ can be decided in time $k^{O(\log k)}n^{O(1)}$. This implies that the isomorphism problem for classes of tournaments of bounded or moderately growing twin width is in polynomial time. By comparison, there are classes of undirected graphs of bounded twin width that are isomorphism complete, that is, the isomorphism problem for the classes is as hard as the general graph isomorphism problem. Twin width is a graph parameter that has been introduced only recently (Bonnet et al., J. ACM 2022), but has received a lot of attention in structural graph theory since then. On directed graphs, it is functionally smaller than clique width. We prove that on tournaments (but not on general directed graphs) it is also functionally smaller than directed tree width (and thus, the same also holds for cut width and directed path width). Hence, our result implies that tournament isomorphism testing is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by any of these parameters.
  Our isomorphism algorithm heavily employs group-theoretic techniques. This seems to be necessary: as a second main result, we show that the combinatorial Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm does not decide isomorphism of tournaments of twin width at most 35 if its dimension is $o(n)$. (Throughout this abstract, $n$ is the order of the input graphs.)</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, which are graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. To classify the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for connected $H$, it remains to consider when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided ``H''-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ that is a star, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. We develop new decomposition theorems resulting in polynomial-time algorithms, and in combination with known results, fully classify all cases $\mathbb{H}_0$ and $\mathbb{H}_1$. To illustrate the wider applicability of our techniques, we also employ them to obtain similar new polynomial-time results for two other classic graph problems: Stable Cut and, in part, Feedback Vertex Set.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>
