      <title>On contact invariants in bordered Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define contact invariants in bordered sutured Floer homology. Given a contact 3-manifold with convex boundary, we apply a result of Zarev (arxiv:1010.3496) to derive contact invariants in the bordered sutured modules $\widehat{\mathit{BSA}}$ and $\widehat{\mathit{BSD}}$, as well as in bimodules $\widehat{\mathit{BSAA}},$ $\widehat{\mathit{BSDD}},$ $\widehat{\mathit{BSDA}}$ in the case of two boundary components. In the connected boundary case, our invariants appear to agree with bordered contact invariants defined by Alishahi-F\"oldv\'ari-Hendricks-Licata-Petkova-V\'ertesi (arxiv:2011.08672) whenever the latter are defined, although ours can be defined in broader contexts. We prove that these invariants satisfy a pairing theorem, which is a bordered extension of the Honda-Kazez-Mati\'c gluing map (arxiv:0705.2828) for sutured Floer homology. We also show that there is a correspondence between certain $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ operations in bordered type-$A$ modules and bypass attachment maps in sutured Floer homology. As an application, we characterize the Stipsicz-V\'ertesi map from $\mathit{SFH}$ to $\widehat{\mathit{HFK}}$ as an $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ action on $\widehat{\mathit{CFA}}$. We also apply the immersed curve interpretation of Hanselman-Rasmussen-Watson (arxiv:1604.03466) to prove results involving contact surgery.</description>

      <title>Smooth Knots with Odd Quadratic Term of the Conway Polynomial Have Inscribed Trefoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inscribed knot is formed by polygonally connecting points lying on a knot $\gamma$ in parametric order, then closing the path by connecting the first and final points. The stick-knot number of a knot type K is the minimum number of line segments needed to polygonally form some knot with the same homotopy type. The stick-knot number of a trefoil is 6. Cole Hugelmeyer studied the manifold $M$ consisting of 6 points lying on a triangular prism and found that by intersecting a perturbation of $M'$, twisting the top of the prism, with $Q_\gamma$, the manifold of 6-tuples of points lying on $\gamma$, any analytic knot with nontrivial quadratic term of its Conway polynomial has an inscribed trefoil. We show that by using a perturbation of the double-cover of the orientation class $[M \cap Q_\gamma]$ and analysis of planar configurations, an analogous result holds for a class of smooth knots with odd quadratic term. We also show that in the analytic case, there are both inscribed left and right-handed trefoils.</description>

      <title>A Bers type classification of big mapping classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an infinite type surface $\Sigma$, we consider the space of (marked) convex hyperbolic structures on $\Sigma$, denoted $H(\Sigma)$, with the Fenchel-Nielsen topology. The (big) mapping class group acts faithfully on this space allowing us to investigate a number of mapping class group invariant subspaces of $H(\Sigma)$ which arise from various geometric properties (e.g. geodesic or metric completeness, ergodicity of the geodesic flow, lower systole bound, discrete length spectrum) of the hyperbolic structure. In particular, we show that the space of geodesically complete convex hyperbolic structures in $H(\Sigma)$ is locally path connected, connected and decomposes naturally into Teichm\"uller subspaces. The big mapping class group of $\Sigma$ acts faithfully on this space allowing us to classify mapping classes into three types ({\it always quasiconformal, sometimes quasiconformal, and never quasiconformal}) in terms of their dynamics on the Teichm\"uller subspaces. Moreover, each type contains infinitely many mapping classes, and the type is relative to the underlying subspace of $H(\Sigma)$ that is being considered.
  As an application of our work, we show that if the mapping class group of a general topological surface $\Sigma$ is algebraically isomorphic to the modular group of a Riemann surface $X$, then $\Sigma$ is of finite topological type and $X$ is homeomorphic to it. Moreover, a big mapping class group can not act on any Teichm\"uller space with orbits equivalent to modular group orbits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $ L $-functions attached to negative definite plumbed manifolds as the Mellin transforms of homological blocks. We prove that they are entire functions and their values at $ s=0 $ are equal to the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants by using asymptotic techniques developed by the author in the previous papers. We also prove that linear relations between special values at negative integers of some $ L $-functions, which are common generalizations of Hurwitz zeta functions, Barnes zeta functions and Epstein zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Universal weight systems from a minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color Lie algebras, which were introduced by Ree, are a graded extension of Lie (super)algebras by an abelian group. We show that the color Lie algebras can be used to construct universal weight systems for knot invariants of of Vassiliev and Kontsevich. As a simple example, we take $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ as the grading group and consider the four-dimensional color Lie algebra called $A1_{\epsilon}$. The weight system constructed from $A1_{\epsilon}$ is studied in some detail and some relations between the weights, such as the recurrence relation for chord diagrams, are derived. These relations show that the weight system from $A1_{\epsilon}$ is a hybrid of those from $sl(2)$ and $gl(1|1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally finite, connected graph $\Gamma$, let $\operatorname{Map}(\Gamma)$ denote the group of proper homotopy equivalences of $\Gamma$ up to proper homotopy. Excluding sporadic cases, we show $\operatorname{Aut}(S(M_\Gamma)) \cong \operatorname{Map}(\Gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}(M_\Gamma)$ is the sphere complex of the doubled handlebody $M_\Gamma$ associated to $\Gamma$. We also construct an exhaustion of $S(M_\Gamma)$ by finite strongly rigid sets when $\Gamma$ has finite rank and finitely many rays, and an appropriate generalization otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of the article on doubly symmetric diagrams and strongly positive amphicheiral knots. We develop an enumeration strategy for prime knots given by doubly symmetric diagrams and determine all cases up to 18 crossings in the doubly symmetric diagram. A digression covers the origin of Gauss words for long curves and explains how Gauss marked non-realizable words.</description>

      <title>Some examples of small irreducible exotic 4-manifolds with free abelian fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce examples of pairwise non-diffeomorphic closed irreducible 4-manifolds with non-trivial free abelian fundamental group of rank less than three and small Euler characteristic. These exotic smooth structures become standard after taking a connected sum with a single copy of $S^2\times S^2$. The contributions of this paper include an explicit mechanism to computate the equivariant intersection form of 4-manifolds that are obtained via torus surgeries and a new stabilization result concerning exotic smooth structures with arbitrary fundamental group.</description>

      <title>On double brackets for marked surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of a double quasi-Poisson bracket on the group algebra associated to the twisted fundamental group of a marked oriented surface $(S,P)$ with boundary, where $P$ is a finite set of marked points on the boundary of the surface $S$ such that on every boundary component there is at least one point of $P$. We show that this double bracket is a noncommutative generalization of the well-known Goldman bracket, defined on the space of free homotopy classes of loops on $S$. For an algebra $A$ without polynomial identities, we construct a double bracket on the space of decorated twisted $\mathrm{GL}_n(A)$-, symplectic and indefinite orthogonal local systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Donaldson and Segal on the counts of monopoles and special Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, we prove a compactness theorem for Fueter sections of charge 2 monopole bundles over 3-manifolds: Let $u_k$ be a sequence of Fueter sections of the charge 2 monopole bundle over a closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $(M,g)$, with $L^\infty$-norm diverging to infinity. Then a renormalized sequence derived from $u_k$ subsequentially converges to a non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-form $\mathcal{V}$ on $M$ in the $W^{1,2}$-topology.</description>

      <title>Anosov flows in dimension 3: an outside look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes were intended as support material for a minicourse on Anosov flows in the conference "Symplectic geometry and Anosov flows'' which took place in Heidelberg in July 2024 organized by Peter Albers, Jonathan Bowden and Agust\'in Moreno. I took the invitation to present the subject as asking from an outsider view of the subject, given the fact that my research uses both ideas and results from the theory of Anosov flows. The point of view of the course is to provide an overview of the main results and questions in the subject, with emphasis on the interaction with topology, geometry, specially symplectic geometry and contact aspects of the theory. Some detail is given in the presentation of the Barbot-Fenley theory of leaf spaces. Hopefully the notes will contribute in gaining a working knowledge of the theory and its many beautiful connections.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic finiteness properties of locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare finiteness properties of locally compact groups that generalize the properties of being compactly generated and of being compactly presented. Three such families of properties have been proposed: Abels--Tiemeyer's type $C_n$, coarse $(n-1)$-connectedness, and Castellano--Corob-Cook's type $F_n$. The first was defined for locally compact groups, the second can be defined for general topological groups, while the third was defined only for tdlc groups. We prove that all three families lead to the same notion for locally compact groups. This justifies working with these properties despite the fact that it is still unclear in which sense they describe finiteness properties of free classifying spaces for locally compact groups. Various parts of the arguments are well-known to various experts. By putting them together we hope to clarify the literature.</description>

      <title>Fillability obstructions for high-dimensional confoliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study confoliations in dimensions higher than three mostly from the perspective of symplectic fillability. Our main result is that Massot-Niederkr\"uger-Wendl's bordered Legendrian open book, an object that obstructs the weak symplectic fillability of contact manifolds, admits a generalization for confoliations equipped with symplectic data. Applications include the non-fillability of the product of an overtwisted contact manifold and a class of symplectic manifolds, and the fact that Bourgeois contact structures associated with overtwisted contact manifolds admit no weak symplectic fillings for which the symplectic structure restricts at the boundary to a positive generator of the second cohomology of the torus factor. In addition, along the lines of the original $3$-dimensional work of Eliashberg and Thurston, we give a new definition of approximation and deformation of confoliations by contact structures and describe some natural examples.</description>

      <title>Vanishing cycles of symplectic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have shown that the usual generalizations of taut foliations to higher dimensions, based only on topological concepts, do not yield a theory comparable in richness to the $3$-dimensional one. The aim of this article is to prove that strong symplectic foliations are, however, a natural candidate for such a generalization that does lead to some interesting rigidity results, such as potentially topological obstructions on the underlying ambient manifold. We introduce a high-dimensional generalization of $3$-dimensional vanishing cycles for symplectic foliations, which we call Lagrangian vanishing cycles, and prove that they prevent a symplectic foliation from being strong, just as vanishing cycles prevent tautness in dimension $3$ due to a classical result by Novikov from 1964. We then describe, in every codimension, examples of symplectically foliated manifolds which admit Lagrangian vanishing cycles, but for which more classical arguments do not obstruct the foliation from being strong. In codimension $1$, this is achieved by a rather explicit modification of the symplectic foliation, which allows us to open up closed leaves having non-trivial holonomy on both sides, and is thus of independent interest. Since there is no comprehensive source on holomorphic curves with boundary in symplectic foliations, we also give a detailed introduction to much of the analytic theory, hoping that it might serve as a reference for future work in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homotopy groups of spaces of long links in Euclidean space of codimension at least three. With multiple components, they admit split injections from homotopy groups of spheres. We show that, up to knotting, these account for all the homotopy groups in a range which depends on the dimensions of the source manifolds and target manifold and which roughly generalizes the triple-point-free range for isotopy classes. Just beyond this range, joining components sends both a parametrized long Borromean rings class and a Hopf fibration to a generator of the first nontrivial homotopy group of the space of long knots. For spaces of equidimensional long links of most source dimensions, we describe generators for the homotopy group in this degree in terms of these Borromean rings and homotopy groups of spheres. A key ingredient in most of our results is a graphing map which increases source and target dimensions by one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove for the first time that knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology can detect non-fibered knots, and that HOMFLY homology detects infinitely many such knots; these theories were previously known to detect a mere six knots, all fibered. These results rely on our main technical theorem, which gives a complete classification of genus-1 knots in the 3-sphere whose knot Floer homology in the top Alexander grading is 2-dimensional. We discuss applications of this classification to problems in Dehn surgery which are carried out in two sequels. These include a proof that $0$-surgery characterizes infinitely many knots, generalizing results of Gabai from his 1987 resolution of the Property R Conjecture.</description>

      <title>A prime decomposition theorem for string links in a thickened surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a prime decomposition theorem for string links in a thickened surface. Namely, we prove that any non-braid string link $\ell \subset \Sigma \times I$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact orientable (not necessarily closed) surface other than $S^2$, can be written in the form $\ell =\ell_1 \# \ldots \# \ell_m$, where $\ell_j,j=1,\ldots,m,$ is prime string link defined up to braid equivalence, and the decomposition is unique up to possibly permuting the order of factors in its right-hand side.</description>

      <title>A note on the unknotting number and the region unknotting number of weaving knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weaving knot is an alternating knot whose minimal diagram is a closed braid of a lattice-like pattern. In this paper, the warping degree of a braid diagram is defined, and upper bounds of the unknotting number and the region unknotting number for some families of weaving knots are given by diagrammatical and combinatorial examination of the warping degree of weaving knot diagrams.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On meandric permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a bijection between meanders and special sorts of Gauss diagrams which aroused from the Thurston generators of braid groups. It allows us to give an algorithm to construct such diagrams and to code meanders by matrices which are exactly incident matrices of the corresponding adjacency graphs of the diagrams. Finally, we show that these matrices are idempotent over the field $\mathsf{GF}(2)$, and obtain a criterion for a permutation to be meandric.</description>

      <title>Suspension Splitting and Cohomotopy Sets of Simply Connected $7$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed simply connected $7$-manifold. In this paper we give homotopy decompositions of the reduced suspension space $\Sigma M$ into a wedge sum of simple spaces when localized at a set of primes. As an application, we combine them to investigate the cohomotopy sets $\pi^k(M)$ or the $p$-local cohomotopy sets $\pi^k(M;\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$.</description>

      <title>Fiber sum formulas for 4-manifolds, topological modular forms and $6d\ \mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the relation between four manifolds and topological modular form (TMF) from the six dimensional approach, we exhibit fiber sum formulas for infinite families of smooth spin four manifolds associated to compactifications of free and interacting 6d (1,0) SCFTs. We find that even the free theories have nontrivial fiber sum formulas and their forms are sensitive to an individual theory and parameters of four-manifolds. Furthermore, we reinforce the conjecture of Stolz and Teichner by expanding its evidence.</description>

      <title>Basins of Equilibria and geometry of Global Sectors in Holomorphic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper to [Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincare-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows, Nicolas Kainz, Dirk Lebiedz (2024)] we investigate the global topology and geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x} = F(x)$ with entire vector field $F$ by exploiting and extending the local structure of finite elliptic decompositions. We prove topological properties of the basins of centers, nodes, and foci, while excluding isolated equilibria at the boundaries of the latter two. We propose a definition of global elliptic sectors and introduce the notion of a sector-forming orbit allowing global topological analysis. The structure of heteroclinic regions between two equilibria is characterized.</description>
