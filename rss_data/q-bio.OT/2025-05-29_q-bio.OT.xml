      <title>Early Assessment of Artificial Lower Extremity Sensory Response Times and Proprioceptive Acuity via Sensory Cortex Electrical Stimulation</title>

Abstract: Bi-directional brain computer interfaces (BD-BCIs) may restore brain-controlled walking and artificial leg sensation after spinal cord injury. Current BD-BCIs provide only simplistic "tingling" feedback, which lacks proprioceptive information to perceive critical gait events (leg swing, double support). This information must also be perceived adequately fast to facilitate timely motor responses. Here, we investigated utilizing primary sensory cortex (S1) direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCES) to deliver leg proprioceptive information and measured response times to artificial leg sensations. Subjects with subdural electrocorticogram electrodes over S1 leg areas participated in two tasks: (1) Proprioceptive acuity: subjects identified the difference between DCES-induced percepts emulating various leg swing speeds; (2) Sensory response: measuring subjects' reaction time to DCES-induced leg sensations, with DCES-hand, visual and auditory control conditions. Three subjects were recruited. Only one completed the proprioceptive assessment, achieving 80%, 70%, 60%, and 53% accuracy in discriminating between fast/slow, fast/medium, medium/slow, and same speeds, respectively (p-value=1.9x10$^{-5}$). Response times for leg/hand percepts were 1007$\pm$413/599$\pm$171 ms, visual leg/hand responses were 528$\pm$137/384$\pm$84 ms, and auditory leg/hand responses were 393$\pm$106/352$\pm$93 ms, respectively. These results suggest proprioceptive information can be delivered artificially, but perception may be significantly delayed. Future work should address improving acuity, reducing response times, and expanding sensory modalities.</description>
