      <title>A Fueter operator for 3/2-spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local invariants of a meromorphic quadratic differential on a compact Riemann surface are the orders of zeros and poles, and the residues at the poles of even orders. The main result of this paper is that with few exceptions, every pattern of local invariants can be obtained by a quadratic differential on some Riemann surface. The exceptions are completely classified and only occur in genera zero and one. Moreover, in the case of a nonconnected stratum, we show that, with three exceptions in genus one, every invariants can be realized in each connected component of the stratum. These results are obtained using the flat metric induced by the differentials. We give an application by bounding the number of disjoint cylinders on a primitive quadratic differential.</description>

      <title>On Arf invariants of colored links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several classical knot invariants, such as the Alexander polynomial, the Levine-Tristram signature and the Blanchfield pairing, admit natural extensions from knots to links, and more generally, from oriented links to so-called colored links. In this note, we explore such extensions of the Arf invariant. Inspired by the three examples stated above, we use generalized Seifert forms to construct quadratic forms, and determine when the Arf invariant of such a form yields a well-defined invariant of colored links. However, apart from the known case of oriented links, these new Arf invariants turn out to be determined by the linking numbers.</description>

      <title>A conjecture of Zagier and the value distribution of quantum modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his influential paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier developed a conjectural framework describing the behavior of certain quantum knot invariants under the action of the modular group on their arguments. More precisely, when $J_{K,0}$ denotes the colored Jones polynomial of a knot $K$, Zagier's modularity conjecture describes the asymptotics of the quotient $J_{K,0} (e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)}) / J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominators, where $\gamma \in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This problem is most accessible for the figure-eight knot $4_1$, where the colored Jones polynomial has a simple explicit expression in terms of the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. Zagier also conjectured that the function $h(x) = \log (J_{4_1,0} (e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ which is continuous at irrationals. In the present paper, we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture for all irrationals for which the sequence of partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion is unbounded. In particular, the continuity conjecture holds almost everywhere on the real line. We also establish a smooth approximation of $h$, uniform over all rationals, in accordance with the modularity conjecture. As an application, we find the limit distribution (after a suitable centering and rescaling) of $\log J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$, when $x$ ranges over all reduced rationals in $(0,1)$ with denominator at most $N$, as $N \to \infty$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Bettin and Drappeau.</description>

      <title>Virtual homology of limit groups and profinite rigidity of direct products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the virtual second Betti number of a finitely generated, residually free group $G$ is finite if and only if $G$ is either free, free abelian or the fundamental group of a closed surface. We also prove a similar statement in higher dimensions. We then develop techniques involving rank gradients of pro-$p$ groups, which allow us to recognise direct product decompositions. Combining these ideas, we show that direct products of free and surface groups are profinitely rigid among finitely presented, residually free groups, partially resolving a conjecture of Bridson's. Other corollaries that we obtain include a confirmation of Mel'nikov's surface group conjecture in the residually free case, and a description of closed aspherical manifolds of dimension at least $5$ with a residually free fundamental group.</description>

      <title>On Lipschitz partitions of unity and the Assouad--Nagata dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard partition of unity subordinate to an open cover of a metric space has Lipschitz constant $\max(1,M-1)/\mathcal{L}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lebesgue number and $M$ is the multiplicity of the cover. If the metric space satisfies the approximate midpoint property, such as length spaces do, then the upper bound improves to $(M-1)/(2\mathcal{L})$. These Lipschitz estimates are optimal. We also address the Lipschitz analysis of $\ell^{p}$-generalizations of the standard partition of unity, their partial sums, and their categorical products. Lastly, we characterize metric spaces with Assouad--Nagata dimension $n$ as exactly those metric spaces for which every Lebesgue cover admits an open refinement with multiplicity $n+1$ while reducing the Lebesgue number by at most a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study probabilistic variants of the Lusternik--Schnirelmann category and topological complexity, which bound the classical invariants from below. We present a number of computations illustrating both wide agreement and wide disagreement with the classical notions. In the aspherical case, where our invariants are group invariants, we establish a counterpart of the Eilenberg--Ganea theorem in the torsion-free case, as well as a contrasting universal upper bound in the finite case.</description>
