      <title>The arithmetic of continued fractions in the field of $p$-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued fractions have been long studied due to their strong properties, such as rational approximation. In this extent, their arithmetic over real numbers has represented an intriguing problem throughout the years. In this paper, we develop the arithmetic of continued fractions over the field of $p$-adic numbers. In particular, we provide a complete methodology to compute the $p$-adic continued fraction of the M\"obius transformation and the bilinear fractional transformation of $p$-adic numbers. These allow any standard arithmetic operation over $p$-adic numbers to be performed. In great contrast with real continued fractions, we prove that the knowledge of arbitrarily many partial quotients of the initial continued fractions is not always sufficient to recover some partial quotients of the transformations. However, we prove that the set of elements for which this is not possible has Haar measure zero in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Genus-One Fibrations and the Jacobian of Linear Slices in the Quintic Equal-Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Diophantine equation $a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5$ subject to the linear constraint $(c+d)-(a+b)=h$. We establish the necessary modular condition $30 \mid h$ and focus on the first admissible slice $h=30$. The problem reduces to finding rational sections on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$, which need not admit a section. We explicitly construct the associated Jacobian elliptic surface $E/\mathbb{Q}(S)$. By exploiting a global rational $2$-torsion point and applying the Gusi\'c-Tadi\'c injectivity criterion for the specialization homomorphism, we prove the upper bound $\mathrm{rank}\,E(\mathbb{Q}(S))\le 1$. This result severely restricts the possible structure of infinite families of integer solutions within the slice.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite subset of an abelian group $G$, and suppose that $|A+A|\leq K|A|$. We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that $A$ can be covered by at most $\exp(C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon})$ translates of a convex coset progression with dimension at most $C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon}$ and size at most $\exp(C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon})|A|$. This falls just short of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, which asserts that this statement is true for $\epsilon=0$, and improves on results of Sanders and Konyagin, who showed that this statement is true for all $\epsilon&gt;2$. To prove this result, we use a mixture of entropy methods and Fourier analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exponential sums on Witt vectors, known as Gauss--Heilbronn sums, and the curves whose Frobenius traces realize these sums via a Deligne--Lusztig type construction. For 3-typical Witt vectors of length two, we analyze Gauss--Heilbronn sums, from which we fully determine the Frobenius slopes of the associated curves.</description>

      <title>Unit-generated orders of real quadratic fields I. Class number bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $\Delta(\mathcal{O}) = \Delta_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $\Delta(\mathcal{O}) = \Delta_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|\Delta(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|\Delta(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $\Delta \leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</description>

      <title>On the rational approximation to linear combinations of powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex number $x$, $\Vert x\Vert:=\min\{|x-m|:m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Let $k\geq 1$ be an integer, and $K$ be a number field. Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$ be algebraic numbers with $|\alpha_i|\geq 1$ and let $d_i$ denotes the degree of $\alpha_i$ for $1\leq i\leq k$. Set $d=d_1+\cdots+d_k$. In this article, we show that if the inequality $
0&lt;\Vert\lambda_1 q\alpha^n_1+\cdots+\lambda_k q\alpha^n_k\Vert&lt;\frac{\theta^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $
has infinitely many solutions in $(n, q,\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times (K^\times)^k$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $\lambda_i$ is small compared to $n$ and some $\theta\in (0,1)$, then, in particular, the tuple $(\lambda_1 q\alpha^n_1,\ldots, \lambda_k q\alpha^n_k)$ is pseudo-Pisot, and at least one of $\alpha_i$ is an algebraic integer. This result can be viewed as Roth's type theorem for linear combinations of powers of algebraic numbers over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. The case $q=1$ was recently proved by Kulkarni, Mavraki, and Nguyen \cite{kul}, which is a generalization of Mahler's question proved in \cite{corv}. As a consequence of our result, we obtain the following generalization of this question: let $\alpha&gt;1$ be an algebraic number with $d=[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]$. For a given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, if the inequality $$ 0&lt;\Vert\lambda q\alpha^n\Vert&lt;\frac{\theta^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $$ has infinitely many solutions in the tuples $(n,q,\lambda)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times K^\times$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $\lambda$ is small compared to $n$ and $\theta\in (0,1)$, then some power of $\alpha$ is a Pisot number. As an application of this result, we deduce the transcendence of certain infinite products of algebraic numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct infinitely many quadruples of real quadratic fields whose class numbers are all divisible by $3$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result towards the divisibility of the class numbers of certain tuples of real quadratic fields. At the end, we give an application of this result to produce some elliptic curves having a $3$-torsion subgroup.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Period Map and Complex Multiplication for Cubic Fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an arithmetic period map for cubic fourfolds, in direct analogy with Rizov's work on K3 surfaces. For each $N\geq 1$, we introduce a Deligne-Mumford stack $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}$ of cubic fourfolds with level structure and prove that the associated period map $j_{N}:\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}_{\mathbb{C}}\to {\rm Sh}_{K_{N}}(L)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is algebraic, \'etale, and descends to $\mathbb{Q}$ whenever $N$ is coprime to $2310$. As an application, we develop complex multiplication theory for cubic fourfolds and show that every cubic fourfold of CM type is defined over an abelian extension of its reflex field. Moreover, using the CM theory for rank-21 cubic fourfolds, we provide an alternative proof of the modularity of rank-21 cubic fourfolds established by Livn\'e.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic statistics for finite continued fractions with restricted digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zaremba's conjecture concerns a formation of continued fraction expansions for rational numbers with partial quotient bounded by an absolute constant. We present asymptotic estimates for the size of $\epsilon$-thickening of certain fractal sets of bounded-type, which in turn provide additional support for Zaremba's conjecture on average. We also conclude a generalisation for complex continued fractions over imaginary quadratic fields.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein class of a torus bundle and log-rigid analytic classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a topological treatment of the Eisenstein class of a torus bundle, we define log-rigid analytic classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. These are group cohomology classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ valued on log-rigid analytic functions on Drinfeld's $p$-adic symmetric domain. Such classes can be evaluated at points attached to totally real fields of degree $n$ where $p$ is inert. We conjecture that these values are $p$-adic logarithms of Gross--Stark units in the narrow Hilbert class field of totally real fields. We provide evidence for the conjecture by comparing our constructions to $p$-adic $L$-functions. In addition, we prove it in certain situations where the totally real field is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$, as a consequence of the fact that in this case there is a conjugate of a Gross--Stark unit in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>On a tree of rational functions related to continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a binary tree with vertices given by rational functions $p(x)/q(x)$; the root and functional derivation of children are inspired by continued fractions. We prove some special properties of the tree. For example, the zero solutions of the denominators $q(x)$ are all real negative numbers and are dense in $(-\infty,-1]$. For $x&gt;0$ functions are non intersecting and form a dense subset of $(0,1)$. Furthermore, when evaluating the tree for positive rational values, the tree contains every rational in $(0,1)$ exactly once if and only if $x\in \mathbb{N}$. For $x=1$, one finds back the classical Farey tree which is related to regular continued fractions. In the last part, we will make a similar tree in a similar way but for backward continued fractions. We highlight some similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Approximating $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Chern-Simons theory by finite group gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</description>

      <title>On certain correlations into the divisor problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18136v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed irrational $\theta &gt; 0$ with a prescribed irrationality measure function, we study the correlation $\int_1^X \Delta(x) \Delta(\theta x) dx$, where $\Delta$ is the Dirichlet error term in the divisor problem. When $\theta$ has a finite irrationality measure, it is known that decorrelation occurs at a rate expressible in terms of this measure. Strong decorrelation occurs for all positive irrationals, except possibly Liouville numbers. We show that for irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $\psi$, decorrelation can be quantified in terms of $\psi^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin to study model-theoretic properties of non-split isotropic reductive group schemes. In this paper we show that the base ring $K$ is e-interpretable in the point group $G(K)$ of every sufficiently isotropic reductive group scheme $G$. In particular, the Diophantine problems in $K$ and $G(K)$ are equivalent. We also compute the centralizer of the elementary subgroup of $G(K)$ and the common normalizer of all its root subgroups.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 - w^2 = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, which is related to near misses for the quartic case of Fermat's Last Theorem. For certain $n$ we show that the set of solutions is infinite, or more generally not thin. Our approach is via the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, and we prove a more general result on non-thinness of integral points on double conic bundle surfaces.</description>

      <title>Adjoint motives of modular forms and the Tamagawa number conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a newform of weight $k\geq 2$, level $N$ with coefficients in a number field $K$, and $A$ the adjoint motive of the motive $M$ associated to $f$. We carefully discuss the construction of the realisations of $M$ and $A$, as well as natural integral structures in these realisations. We then use the method of Taylor and Wiles to verify the $\lambda$-part of the Tamagawa number conjecture of Bloch and Kato for $L(A,0)$ and $L(A,1)$. Here $\lambda$ is any prime of $K$ not dividing $Nk!$, and so that the mod $\lambda$ representation associated to $f$ is absolutely irreducible when restricted to the Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{(-1)^{(\ell-1)/2}\ell})$ where $\lambda\mid \ell$. The method also establishes modularity of all lifts of the mod $\lambda$ representation which are crystalline of Hodge-Tate type $(0,k-1)$.</description>

      <title>Ikeda type lift on $\SO(3,n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G=\SO(3,n+1)$ over $\Q$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to $\SL_2(\Z)$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and
  $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Anabelian aspects of the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate.
  These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</description>

      <title>A log-motivic cohomology for semistable varieties and its $p$-adic deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02845v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct log-motivic cohomology groups for semistable varieties and study the $p$-adic deformation theory of log-motivic cohomology classes. Our main result is the deformational part of a $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture for varieties with semistable reduction: a rational log-motivic cohomology class in bidegree $(2n,n)$ lifts to a continuous pro-class if and only if its Hyodo-Kato class lies in the $n$-th step of the Hodge filtration. This generalises a theorem of Bloch-Esnault-Kerz which treats the good reduction case. In the case $n=1$ the lifting criterion is the one obtained by Yamashita for the logarithmic Picard group. Along the way, we relate log-motivic cohomology to logarithmic Milnor $K$-theory and the logarithmic Hyodo-Kato Hodge-Witt sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the minimal spectral radii of skew-reciprocal integer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the minimal spectral radii among all skew-reciprocal integer matrices of a fixed even dimension that are primitive or nonnegative and irreducible. In particular, except for dimension six, we show that each such class of matrices realises smaller spectral radii than the corresponding reciprocal class.</description>

      <title>Reduced coaction Lie algebra, double shuffle Lie algebra and noncommutative krv2 equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reduced coaction Lie algebra $\mathfrak{rc}_0$, which is defined by an algebraic equation satisfied by the reduced coaction (an upgraded version of the necklace cobracket) and the skew-symmetric condition. We prove that the double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ together with the skew-symmetric condition injects to $\mathfrak{rc}_0$, and that $\mathfrak{rc}_0$ together with the krv1 equation injects to the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra $\mathfrak{krv}_2$.</description>
