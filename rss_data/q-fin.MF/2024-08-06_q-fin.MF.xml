      <title>The indifference value of the weak information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose indifference pricing to estimate the value of the weak information. Our framework allows for tractability, quantifying the amount of additional information, and permits the description of the smallness and the stability with respect to small perturbations of the weak information. We provide sharp conditions for the stability with counterexamples. The results rely on a theorem of independent interest on the stability of the optimal investment problem with respect to small changes in the physical probability measure. We also investigate contingent claims that are indifference price invariant with respect to changes in weak information. We show that, in incomplete models, the class of information-invariant claims includes the replicable claims, and it can be strictly bigger. In particular, in complete models, all contingent claims are information invariant. We augment the results with examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&amp;P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of the SABR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and reliable simulation scheme for the stochastic-alpha-beta-rho (SABR) model. The two challenges of the SABR simulation lie in sampling (i) the integrated variance conditional on terminal volatility and (ii) the terminal price conditional on terminal volatility and integrated variance. For the first sampling procedure, we analytically derive the first four moments of the conditional average variance, and sample it from the moment-matched shifted lognormal approximation. For the second sampling procedure, we approximate the conditional terminal price as a constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) distribution. Our CEV approximation preserves the martingale condition and precludes arbitrage, which is a key advantage over Islah's approximation used in most SABR simulation schemes in the literature. Then, we adopt the exact sampling method of the CEV distribution based on the shifted-Poisson-mixture Gamma random variable. Our enhanced procedures avoid the tedious Laplace inversion algorithm for sampling integrated variance and non-efficient inverse transform sampling of the forward price in some of the earlier simulation schemes. Numerical results demonstrate our simulation scheme to be highly efficient, accurate, and reliable.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral Approach for Time-Dependent Hamiltonians with Applications to Derivatives Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize a semi-classical path integral approach originally introduced by Giachetti and Tognetti [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 912 (1985)] and Feynman and Kleinert [Phys. Rev. A 34, 5080 (1986)] to time-dependent Hamiltonians, thus extending the scope of the method to the pricing of financial derivatives. We illustrate the accuracy of the approach by presenting results for the well-known, but analytically intractable, Black-Karasinski model for the dynamics of interest rates. The accuracy and computational efficiency of this path integral approach makes it a viable alternative to fully-numerical schemes for a variety of applications in derivatives pricing.</description>

      <title>CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trading on decentralized exchanges via an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism has been massively adopted, with a daily trading volume reaching $1B. This trading method has also received close attention from researchers, central banks, and financial firms, who have the potential to adopt it to traditional financial markets such as foreign exchanges and stock markets. A critical challenge of AMM-powered trading is that transaction order has high financial value, so a policy or method to order transactions in a "good" (optimal) manner is vital. We offer economic measures of both price stability (low volatility) and inequality that inform how a "social planner" should pick an optimal ordering. We show that there is a trade-off between achieving price stability and reducing inequality, and that policymakers must choose which to prioritize. In addition, picking the optimal order can often be costly, especially when performing an exhaustive search over trade orderings (permutations). As an alternative we provide a simple algorithm, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR). This algorithm constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost. We also provide insight into the strategy changes that may occur if traders are subject to this sequencing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Augmented Dynamic Gordon Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a dynamic Gordon growth model, which is augmented by a time--varying spot interest rate and the Gordon growth model for dividends. Using the risk--neutral valuation method and locally risk--minimizing strategy, we obtain pricing and hedging formulas for the dividend--paying European call and put options and equity--linked life insurance products. Also, we provide ML estimator of the model.</description>
