      <title>Homogeneous Linewidth Behaviour of Narrow Optical Emitters at Sub-kelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of ultra-narrow spectral holes in ensembles of solid-state emitters in crystals over a range of sub-kelvin temperatures, with a focus on their potential application in frequency stabilization schemes as an alternative to ultrastable cavities. We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole's center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperaturedependent T^7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole's linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and longitudinal magnetoconductance in pseudospin-1 fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral anomaly (CA), a hallmark of Weyl fermions, has emerged as a cornerstone of condensed matter physics following the discovery of Weyl semimetals. While the anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 (Weyl) systems is well-established, its extension to higher-pseudospin fermions remains a frontier with critical implications for transport phenomena in materials with multifold fermions. We present a rigorous quasiclassical analysis of CA and longitudinal magnetotransport in pseudospin-1 fermions, advancing beyond conventional models that assume constant relaxation times and neglect the orbital magnetic moment and global charge conservation. Our study uncovers a magnetic-field dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductance: it is positive and quadratic-in-B for weak internode scattering and transitions to negative values beyond a critical internode scattering strength. Notably, the critical threshold is lower for pseudospin-1 fermions compared to their pseudospin-1/2 counterparts. We show analytically that the zero-field conductivity is affected more strongly by internode scattering for pseudospin-1 fermions than conventional Weyl fermions. These insights provide a foundational framework for interpreting recent experiments on multifold fermions and offer a roadmap for probing CA in candidate materials with space group symmetries 199, 214, and 220.</description>

      <title>Topological nature of edge states for one-dimensional systems without symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically verify and analytically prove a winding number invariant that correctly predicts the number of edge states in one-dimensional, nearest-neighbour (between unit cells), two-band models with any complex couplings and open boundaries. Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our invariant is invariant under unitary and similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetryprotected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our toy model that applies to non-zero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Winding Berry dipole on uniaxially strained graphene/hBN/hBN moir\'e trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall-like currents can be generated by a time-periodic alternating bias on two-dimensional (2D) materials lacking inversion symmetry. To hint that the moir\'e between graphene and its supporting substrate contributes to the homogeneity of nonlinear currents, the change in the local potential $\Delta V(r)$ around horizontally strained graphene due to a homobilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was obtained from ab initio calculations, and corrections to on-site energies and hopping matrix elements on graphene's tight-binding electronic dispersion of $\pi-$electrons were calculated. Relying on a semiclassical approximation, Berry dipoles $D$ are seen to change orientation and wind throughout the moir\'e lattice.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nested quantum dot structure for improved control of entanglement induced by the Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit with relative motion. The entanglement is quantified by the mutual information (MI). The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces greater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining in the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a function of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of long-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to substantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction, indicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate significant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different moving directions lead to varying MI values. We also consider the scenario without the nested dot and find that the same maximum (among all times) MI is pre-determined solely by the initial angle between the spins. In this case, the entanglement exhibits different growth characteristics during different phases. The saturation of the MI mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional quantum dot, where exchange and time are combined into a single parameter, the amount of interaction.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological States and Chirality by Non-Equilibrium Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonics systems opens new opportunities for developing robust low-power spin-wave-based devices. Introducing non-equilibrium antimagnon can bring additional effects to the topology and chirality. In this report, we revisit the ferromagnetic multilayers with a non-equilibrium state and generalize it to antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayers. We found that non-equilibrium states with the perturbative coupling of magnon and antimagnon can turn an originally trivial state into a non-trivial one, characterized by Chern number. Both coherent coupling and dissipative coupling are found in the band structures and can be controlled by the external magnetic field and torques. Further, in the bilayer unit cell, all four possible chirality combinations are achieved at a few GHz. Our work presents an accessible platform for realizing topological magnonic surface states, paving the way for controlling magnon chirality and facilitating various types of coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of experimental techniques at nanoscale resulted in ability to perform spectroscopic measurements on single-molecule current carrying junctions. These experiments are natural meeting point for research fields of optical spectroscopy and molecular electronics. We present a pedagogical comparison between perturbation theory expansion of standard nonlinear optical spectroscopy and (non-self-consistent) perturbative diagrammatic formulation of the nonequilibrium Green's functions method (NEGF is widely used in molecular electronics) indicating their similarities and differences. Comparing the two approaches we argue that optical spectroscopy of open quantum systems has to be analyzed within the more general Green's function formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional spectroscopy is discussed for open quantum systems with multiple simultaneously measurable fluxes. In particular, we discuss a junction where optical measurements of photon flux are complemented with simultaneous transport measurements of electron currents. Theory of two-dimensional spectroscopy in both fluxes is developed employing non-self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function formulation. Theoretical derivations are illustrated with numerical simulations within generic junction model.</description>

      <title>Upper limit of spin relaxation in suspended graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum transport simulations to investigate the upper limit of spin transport in suspended graphene. We find that thermally-induced atomic-scale corrugations are the dominant factor, limiting spin lifetimes to ~10 ns by inducing a strongly-varying local spin-orbit coupling. These extremely short-range corrugations appear even when the height profile appears to be smooth, suggesting they may be present in any graphene device. We discuss our results in the context of experiments, and briefly consider approaches to suppress these short-range corrugations and further enhance spin lifetimes in graphene-based spin devices.</description>

      <title>The $N_2V$ color center: a ubiquitous visible and near-infrared-II quantum emitter in nitrogen-doped diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Magnon-Magnon Coupling and Its Dynamic Control in Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonics, exploring the coupling between magnons and quantum systems, is an exciting field for developing next-generation information technologies. Achieving a strong and tunable magnon-magnon coupling (MMC) in confined nanomagnets is crucial for the on-chip integration of these hybrid systems and advancing the field. In this work, we numerically investigate the interactions between different magnon modes excited within an elliptical magnonic nano-disc (EMND), demonstrating an anti-crossing effect in the dispersion spectra. A comprehensive theoretical framework was presented that explains this anti-crossing phenomenon as a result of MMC and provide estimates for the strength of the coupling (g). Furthermore, we show that this intermodal coupling can be tuned from a strong coupling regime (g = 300 MHz) to a weak coupling regime by varying the direction of the external magnetic field and the intrinsic properties of the EMND. Our combined numerical and theoretical findings offer new insights into MMC, significantly advancing the field of quantum magnonics and magnon-based quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Spin-transfer torque in altermagnets with magnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Coulomb oscillations of a quantum antidot formed by an airbridged pillar gate in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum antidots (QAD) are attractive for manipulating quasiparticles in quantum Hall (QH) systems. Here, we form a QAD in the integer and fractional QH regimes at nominal Landau-level filling factor $\nu$ = 2, 1, and 2/3 using a submicron pillar gate with an airbridge connection. After confirming the required conditions for a fully depleted QAD, we analyze the observed Coulomb oscillations in terms of the area of the QAD and the effective charge for the oscillation period in an identical gate voltage range. The area at $\nu$ = 2/3 is significantly smaller than that at $\nu$ = 2 and 1, in qualitative agreement with the previous report. By assuming a constant gate capacitance, the effective charge at $\nu$ = 2/3 is about 2/3 of that at $\nu$ = 2 and 1. The QAD device can be used to capture and emit charges in the unit of 2e/3.</description>

      <title>Engineering two-dimensional kagome topological insulator from porous graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study sets forth a carbon based two-dimensional (2D) kagome topological insulator without containing any metal atoms, that aligns the Fermi level with the Dirac point without the need for doping, overcoming a significant bottleneck issue observed in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based kagome structures. Our 2D kagome structure formed by creating patterned nano pores in the graphene sheet, nomenclatured as porous graphene-based kagome lattice (PGKL), is inspired by the recent bottom-up synthesis of similar structures. Because of absence of mirror symmetry in our porous graphene, by considering only first nearest neighbour intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) within the tight-binding model unlike mostly used next nearest neighbour ISOC in the Kane-Mele model for graphene, PGKL exhibits distinctive band structures with Dirac bands amidst flat bands, allowing for the realization of topological states near the Fermi level. Delving into Berry curvature and Chern numbers provides a comprehensive understanding of the topological insulating properties of PGKL, offering valuable insights into 2D topological insulators. Analysis of the 1-D ribbon structure underscores the emergence of topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Effective tuning methods for few-electron regime in gate-defined quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systematic methods for compensating gate crosstalk effects in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs), to allow the observation of Coulomb blockade peaks from the few-electron regime (N = 1) to N \approx 20. Gate crosstalk, where adjustments to one gate voltage unintentionally affect other gate-controlled parameters, makes it difficult to control tunneling rates and energy states of the QD separately. To overcome this crosstalk effect, we present two approaches: maintaining constant conductance of two quantum point contacts (QPCs) forming the QD by compensating the effect of the plunger gate voltage on the QPCs, and interpolating between gate voltage conditions optimized for QD observation at several electron numbers. These approaches minimize crosstalk effects by dynamically adjusting barrier gate voltages as a function of plunger gate voltage. Using these methods, we successfully observed Coulomb blockade peaks throughout the entire range from N = 1 to N \approx 20. Our methods provide a simple and effective solution for observing Coulomb blockade peaks over a wide range of electron numbers while maintaining control over the quantum states in the dot.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Domain Wall Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Gatemon Qubit Revisited for Improved Reliability and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum circuits based on hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions holds promise for exploring their mesoscopic physics and for building novel superconducting devices. The gate-tunable superconducting transmon qubit (gatemon) is the paradigmatic example of such a superconducting circuit. However, gatemons typically suffer from unstable and hysteretic qubit frequencies with respect to the applied gate voltage and reduced coherence times. Here we develop methods for characterizing these challenges in gatemons and deploy these methods to compare the impact of shunt capacitor designs on gatemon performance. Our results indicate a strong frequency- and design-dependent behavior of the qubit stability, hysteresis, and dephasing times. Moreover, we achieve highly reliable tuning of the qubit frequency with 1 MHz precision over a range of several GHz, along with improved stability in grounded gatemons compared to gatemons with a floating capacitor design.</description>

      <title>A proposal for skyrmion-based diode-like device in antiferromagnetic nanostripe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromagnetic simulations were employed to investigate the dynamics of a single skyrmion within an antiferromagnetic nanostripe with spatially engineered magnetic properties. This study investigates skyrmion motion within an antiferromagnetic nanostripe engineered with trapezoidal regions of enhanced magnetic anisotropy, enabling diode-like functionality by selectively directing skyrmion movement. Our findings demonstrate that skyrmions can cross these barriers in one direction while being obstructed in the reverse direction, mimicking diode behavior. A detailed analysis is presented on how geometric parameters, such as the inclination angle of the trapezoidal barriers, impact skyrmion motion and device efficacy. Additionally, we reveal that an optimal combination of current density and anisotropy is essential to facilitate efficient skyrmion transport through the nanostripe without reverse movement or annihilation. This work advances the development of skyrmion-based devices for spintronic applications. It provides valuable insights into designing structures that harness controlled topological dynamics</description>

      <title>A Route Toward the On-Surface Synthesis of Organic Ferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance is an intuitive way to induce high-spin ground states in bipartite polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs). Such high-spin molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study many-body physics and fundamental models in quantum magnetism. Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings leading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT), a PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving a direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice coupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning probe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with majority-majority and minority-minority couplings. We expect our proof-of-principle study to provide impetus for the design of purely organic ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions impose fundamental limits on the brightness of continuous and pulsed electron beams. When multiple electrons leave a field emitter within a space-time volume of femtoseconds and nanometers, their mutual repulsion creates well-defined correlations in energy and time. Such correlations remain undetected in ensemble measurements that average over the statistics of the emission process. Here, we employ event-based and femtosecond-gated detection of photoelectron states to map Coulomb-correlated few-particle phase-space distributions. Inelastic electron-light scattering experiments performed on two-electron states reveal a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space. Reconstructing the phase-space density, we find an overall energy-time dispersion that is distinct from that of the two separated sub-ensembles forming the bimodal distribution. Our findings disentangle correlation-induced and dispersive contributions to the energy-time structure of few-electron pulses and promote future electron microscopy schemes enhanced by multi-electron states.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hall conductivity in monolayer 1T^{\prime}-MoS_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological and transport properties of 1T^{\prime}-MoS{_2} exhibiting Rashba spin-splitting, focusing on spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity, Berry curvature dynamics, and Nernst coefficient. Rashba spin-splitting leads to spin-polarized electronic states with distinct spin textures, offering potential applications in spintronic devices. The pseudo-spin texture of conduction and valence bands reveals eddy and junction-like patterns around Dirac points, with opposing orientations for spin-up and spin-down states. We analyze Berry curvature behavior near Dirac points for varying {\alpha} values, demonstrating local conservation of Berry curvature and topological phase transitions in 1T^{\prime}-MoS{_2}. When {\alpha&lt;1}, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase, characterized by dominant spin-resolved Hall conductivity, helical edge mode, and a non-trivial topological gap. For {\alpha&gt;1}, a topological phase transition to the Band Insulator (BI) occurs, marked by the dominance of valley-resolved Hall conductivity, absence of the edge modes and reversed Berry curvature signs. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and electric fields. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T^{\prime}-MoS{_2} and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of half-metallic ferromagnetism and valley polarization in transition metal substituted WSTe monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials hold a great importance in spintronic and valleytronic applications due to their unique lattice structures and emergent properties. They intrinsically exhibit both an in-plane inversion and out-of-plane mirror symmetry breakings, which offer a new degree of freedom to electrons in the material. One of the main limitations in the multifunctional applications of these materials is, however, that, they are usually non-magnetic in nature. Here, using first-principles calculations, we propose to induce magnetic degree of freedom in non-magnetic WSTe via doping with transition metal (TM) elements -- Fe, Mn and Co. Further, we comprehensively probe the electronic, spintronic and valleytronic properties in these systems. Our simulations predict intrinsic Rashba and Zeeman-type spin splitting in pristine WSTe. The obtained Rashba parameter is $\sim$ 422 meV\AA\; along the $\Gamma - K$ direction. Our study shows a strong dependence on uniaxial and biaxial strains where we observe an enhancement of $\sim$ 2.1\% with 3\% biaxial compressive strain. The electronic structure of TM-substituted WSTe reveals half-metallic nature for 6.25 and 18.75\% of Fe, 25\% of Mn, and 18.75 and 25\% of Co structures, which leads to 100\% spin polarization. The obtained values of valley polarization 65, 54.4 and 46.3 meV for 6.25\% of Fe, Mn and Co, respectively, are consistent with the literature data for other Janus materials. Further, our calculations show a strain dependent tunability of valley polarization, where we find an increasing (decreasing) trend with uniaxial and biaxial tensile (compressive) strains. We observed a maximum enhancement of $\sim$ 1.72\% for 6.25\% of Fe on application of 3\% biaxial tensile strain.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of the dissipation of surface acoustic waves by ferromagnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry of the coupling between surface acoustic waves and ferromagnetic resonance in a thin magnetic film of CoFeB deposited on top of a piezoelectric Z-cut LiNbO3 substrate. We vary the orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the wavevector of the surface acoustic wave. Experiments indicate an unexpected 2-fold symmetry of the absorption of the SAW energy by the magnetic film. We discuss whether this symmetry can arise from the magnetoelastic torque of the longitudinal strain and the magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic resonance. We find that one origin of the 2-fold symmetry can be the weak in-plane uniaxial anisotropy present within the magnetic film. This phenomena adds to the previously identified other source of 2-fold symmetry but shall persist for ultrathin films when the dipolar interactions cease to contribute to the anisotropy of the slope of the spin wave dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials has propelled advancements in technological devices. The Nernst effect, which generates a transverse electric voltage in the presence of a longitudinal thermal gradient, shows great promise for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we report the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$, a layered self-intercalated vdW material which exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN ~ 191 K followed by a ferromagnetic-like phase transition at TC ~171 K. We observe a prominent topological Hall effect and topological Nernst effect between TC and TN, which is ascribable to non-coplanar spin textures inducing a real-space Berry phase due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we show that Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ exhibits a substantial anomalous Nernst effect, featuring a giant Nernst angle of ~37% near TC and a maximum Nernst thermoelectric coefficient of 0.52 uV/K. These results surpass those of conventional ferromagnets and other two-dimensional vdW materials, highlighting Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ as a promising candidate for advanced thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loop and Topological Properties in 3D Woodpile Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the first and the second order topological states of electromagnetic (EM) wave in the three-dimensional (3D) woodpile photonic crystal (PhC). The recent studies on 3D PhCs have mainly focused on the observation of the topological states. Here, we not only focus on finding the topological states but also propose a numerical calculation method for topological invariants, which is based on the Wilson loop. For the 3D woodpile PhC, the topological states emerge due to the finite difference in the winding number or partial Chern number. The selection rule for the emergence of topological hinge states is also pointed out based on the topological invariants. Our numerical calculation results are essential and put a step toward the experimental realization of topological waveguide in 3D PhCs.</description>

Abstract: Magnon blockade (MB) serves as an efficient mechanism for generating a single magnon, which holds significance in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize magnon blockade effects in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG\thinspace micromagnet and a skyrmion. Through numerical simulations, we explore the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under various parameter regimes and examine the influence of the ambient thermal noise on the magnon blockade effects. The results indicate that the behavior of the second-order correlation function for the magnon mode critically depends on the skyrmion qubit-magnon coupling strength and the drive detuning. By tuning the drive field, the system effectively suppresses multi-magnon state and yields a high-purity single-magnon state, exhibiting pronounced antibunching and magnon blockade effects. This scheme provides a feasible and versatile new all-magnetic platform for achieving high-purity single-magnon sources.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative cathodoluminescence microscopy of beam-sensitive materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence microscopy is now a well-established and powerful tool for probing the photonic properties of nanoscale materials, but in many cases, nanophotonic materials are easily damaged by the electron-beam doses necessary to achieve reasonable cathodoluminescence signal-to-noise ratios. Two-dimensional materials have proven particularly susceptible to beam-induced modifications, yielding both obstacles to high spatial-resolution measurement and opportunities for beam-induced patterning of quantum photonic systems. Here pan-sharpening techniques are applied to cathodoluminescence microscopy in order to address these challenges and experimentally demonstrate the promise of pan-sharpening for minimally-perturbative high-spatial-resolution spectrum imaging of beam-sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing assisted topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture diposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which supports topological MZMs at the end of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to a superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble in the quantum regime is strongly coupled to one of the tunable frequency modes of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR mode of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent, entanglement-enabled quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to state-of-the-art gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons can endow quantum devices with new functionalities. Assessing their potential requires precise characterization of magnon properties. Here, we use a superconducting qubit to probe magnons in a ferrimagnet over a range of about 2000 excitations. Using qubit control and parametrically induced qubit-magnon interactions we demonstrate few-excitation sensitive detection of magnons and are able to accurately resolve their decay. These results introduce quantum circuits as high-dynamic range probes for magnons and provide an avenue toward sensitive detection of nontrivial magnon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates advancements in hydrogen storage technologies. This study investigates the hydrogen adsorption characteristics of graphene and a (8,0) carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with adatoms of various elements. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the universal interatomic potential 'PreFerred Potential' (PFP) implemented in the Matlantis framework, we explore the hydrogen storage capabilities of these doped carbon structures at 77K. We analyze the adsorption efficiency based on the position of adatoms (top, bridge, and hollow sites) and find that the group II elements, such as calcium and strontium, exhibit significant hydrogen uptake. Additionally, light elements like lithium and sodium demonstrate enhanced gravimetric hydrogen storage due to their low atomic mass. Our findings provide insights into the potential of doped graphene and CNTs for efficient hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Strain Tuning of Er3+ in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Er3+ color centers are promising candidates for quantum science and technology due to their long electron and nuclear spin coherence times, as well as their desirable emission wavelength. By selecting host materials with suitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used to tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric material with known methods of engineering different domain configurations through epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin films, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is resolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the optical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the ferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks for films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these results to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3 crystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original substituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship between the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix lays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering ferroelectric order parameters</description>

Abstract: This chapter reviews the state of the art in mutually synchronized spin-torque and spin Hall nano-oscillator (STNO and SHNO) arrays. After briefly introducing the underlying physics, we discuss different nano-oscillator implementations and their functional properties with respect to frequency range, output power, phase noise, and modulation rates. We then introduce the concepts and the theory of mutual synchronization and discuss the possible coupling mechanisms in spintronic nano-oscillators, such as dipolar, electrical, and spin-wave coupling. We review the experimental literature on mutually synchronized STNOs and SHNOs in one- and two-dimensional arrays and discuss ways to increase the number of mutually synchronized nano-oscillators. Finally, the potential for applications ranging from microwave signal sources/detectors and ultrafast spectrum analyzers to neuromorphic computing elements and Ising machines is discussed together with the specific electronic circuitry that has been designed so far to harness this potential.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junctions supply the nonlinear inductance element in superconducting qubits. In the widely used transmon configuration, where the junction is shunted by a large capacitor, the low charging energy minimizes the sensitivity of the qubit to charge noise while maintaining the necessary anharmonicity to qubit states. We report here low-frequency transport measurements on small standalone junctions and identically fabricated capacitively-shunted junctions that show two distinct features normally attributed to small capacitance junctions near zero bias: reduced switching currents and prominent finite resistance associated with phase diffusion in the current-voltage characteristic. Our transport data reveals the existence of phase fluctuations in transmons arising from intrinsic junction capacitance.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism and Topology of the Higher Flat Band in a Fractional Chern Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators provides an opportunity to investigate zero magnetic field anyons. To potentially realize non-Abelian anyons, one approach is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher Landau levels. Here, we investigate the interaction, topology, and ferromagnetism of the second moir\'e miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. At half filling of the second miniband, we observe spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. The Chern numbers of the top two moir\'e flat bands exhibit opposite signs for twist angles above 3.1{\deg}, but share the same sign near 2.6{\deg}, consistent with theoretical predictions. In the 2.6{\deg} device, increasing magnetic field induces a topological phase transition via band crossing between opposite valleys, resulting in an emergent state with Chern number C = -2. Additionally, an insulating state at half filling of the second valley-polarized band suggests a charge-ordered state is favored over the fractional Chern insulator state. These findings lay a foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, crucial for the discovery of non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons offer a promising path toward energy-efficient information transmission and the development of next-generation classical and quantum computing technologies. However, methods to efficiently excite, manipulate, and detect magnons remain a critical need. Here, we show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization as a result of both their spin and orbital moments. We demonstrate this by calculating the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb antiferromagnets. The electric polarization becomes finite when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is present and its magnitude can be increased by symmetries of the system. We illustrate this by computing and comparing the electric polarizations induced by the magnon Nernst effects in 2D materials with N\'eel and Zigzag ordering. Our findings show that in the Zigzag order, where the effect is dominated by the magnon orbital moment, the induced electric polarization is approximately three orders of magnitude greater than in the N\'eel phase. These findings reveal that electric fields could enable both detection and manipulation of magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could lead to more practical use of magnons for future computing and information transmission device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the transport properties of a hybrid nanodevice comprised of two large metallic islands incorporated in a two-dimensional electron gas. The high-tunability of the conducting channels electrically connecting two islands to the leads allows us to treat the setup as a realization of a multi-channel two-site charge Kondo (2SCK) model. It is shown that the leading temperature dependence of the conductance in the 2SCK circuit satisfies the conductance scaling of a single-impurity problem in a Luttinger liquid, whose interaction parameter is fully determined by the number of conducting channels in the device. We demonstrate that the finite weak backscattering in all conducting channels features the appearance of the subleading temperature dependencies in linear conductance. At the special critical point, we predict an equivalency between the 2SCK nanodevice and a single-site two-channel charge Kondo problem, where one Kondo channel is implemented by a non-interacting electron gas and the second Kondo channel is attributed to the Luttinger liquid.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetic Moment Dynamics and Hanle Magnetoresistance in Multilayered 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE), resulting from non-trivial quantum geometry of 2D materials, has several potential advantages over the spin Hall effect (SHE), the latter being well known for its many applications in spintronics. Like the spin Hall effect, the OHE occurs in nonmagnetic materials without stringent symmetry requirements, but unlike the SHE it does no rely on relatively weak spin-orbit interaction. In 2D materials, these advantages risk to be nullified by the difficulty of turning the orbital moment away from the out-of-plane direction. Multilayered 2D materials offer a way out of this difficulty because the fluctuating in-plane component of the orbital moment, due to motion of electrons between the layers, can latch to a magnetic field. To describe this effect we have derived a semi-phenomenological equation of motion for the density of orbital magnetic moment in stacked 2D materials subjected to a magnetic field. Unlike the equations of motion for the spin, these equations produce a strongly anisotropic dynamics, which is governed by an inverse effective mass tensor for which we provide a fully microscopic expression. As a first application, we combine our equation of motion with phenomenological drift-diffusion equations to obtain a theory of orbital Hanle magnetoresistance in multilayered 2D materials.</description>

      <title>From perfect to imperfect poor man's Majoranas in minimal Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poor man's Majoranas (PMMs) hold the promise to engineer Majorana bound states in a highly tunable setup consisting of a chain of quantum dots that are connected via superconductors. Due to recent progress in controlling the amplitudes of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), two vital ingredients for PMMs, experimental investigations of PMMs have gained significant interest. Previously, analytic conditions for the "sweet spots" that result in PMMs have focused on systems with infinite Zeeman energy. Here, we derive analytically a sweet spot condition for PMMs in a system with finite Zeeman energy in the absence of Coulomb interaction. We then consider two numerical models, one in which ECT and CAR are transmitted via superconducting bulk states and one in which they are transmitted via an Andreev bound state. We demonstrate that the analytical sweet spot conditions can only be approximated in these more realistic models, but they cannot be satisfied exactly. As a consequence, we do not find perfect PMMs in these systems, but instead near-zero-energy states that are highly, but not perfectly, localized. These states can be considered as imperfect PMMs and their classification relies on threshold values, which adds some arbitrariness to the concept of PMMs.</description>

      <title>Mapping the topological proximity-induced gap of multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs), devices in which a normal metal is in contact with three or more superconducting leads, have been proposed as artificial analogs of topological crystals. The topological nature of MTJJs manifests as a modulation of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) in the normal metal that may be probed by tunneling measurements. We show that one can reveal this modulation by measuring the resistance of diffusive MTJJs with normal contacts, which shows rich structure as a function of the phase differences $\{\phi_i \}$. Our approach demonstrates a simple yet powerful technique for exploring topological effects in MTJJs.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Long-Range Interactions in Mesoscopic Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: o address the challenges posed by current magnetism research into systems with complex magnetic ordering and interfaces, we developed mumax+, an extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using finite difference discretization. Here, we present its design and verification and discuss features not available in mumax3, such as the modeling of antiferromagnets with magnetoelastic coupling. As an illustration of its capabilities, we show that mumax+ can predict antiferromagnetic domain walls and their velocity induced by spin transfer torques, as well as the dispersion relations for antiferromagnetic spin waves, elastic waves, and their magnetoelastic anticrossing behavior.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamic bounds on logical circuit operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.</description>

      <title>Probing entanglement dynamics and topological transitions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate quench dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain on the IBM quantum computers, calculating the R\'enyi entanglement entropy, the twist order parameter and the Berry phase. The latter two quantities can be deduced from a slow-twist operator defined in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem. The R\'enyi entropy is obtained using a recently developed randomized measurement scheme. The twist order parameter and the Berry phase are measured without the need for additional gates or ancilla qubits. We consider quench protocols in which a trivial initial state evolves dynamically in time under the topological SSH Hamiltonian in the fully dimerized limit (the flat-band limit). During these quenches, there are persistent and periodic oscillations in the time evolution of both entanglement entropy and twist order parameter. Through the implementation of error mitigation techniques using a global depolarizing ansatz and postselection, our simulations on the IBM devices yield results that closely match exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Two Dimensional Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ Perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and characterize a novel two-dimensional material, 2D-CRO, derived from bulk calcium-based ruthenates (CROs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, Ca$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n = 1$ and $2$). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer limit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic properties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by zero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through dimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion symmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the absence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and computational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both with and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that contribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO as a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and topological features.</description>

      <title>Interlayer coupling rotatable magnetic easy-axis in MnSe2 mono- and bi-layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in tuning the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of two-dimensional materials, influenced by the number of layers, interlayer distances, and stacking order. However, its effect on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that interlayer coupling can significantly alter the magnetic easy-axis orientation, as shown by the magnetic easy-axis of monolayer 1T-MnSe2 tilting 67{\deg} from the z-axis, while aligning with the z-axis in the bilayer. This change results from variations in orbital occupations near the Fermi level, particularly involving nonmetallic Se atoms. Contrary to the traditional focus on magnetic metal atoms, our findings reveal that Se orbitals play a key role in influencing the easy-axis orientation and topological Chern numbers. Furthermore, we validated our conclusions by changing stacking orders, introducing charge doping, applying in-plane biaxial strains, and substituting non-metallic atoms. Our results highlight the pivotal role of interlayer coupling in tuning the magnetic properties of layered materials, with important implications for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kagome Materials: Theoretical Insights, Experimental Realizations, and Electronic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the discovery and construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome materials. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice model and its variants, followed by discussions on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of 2D kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Prolonging Carrier Lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC Epilayer by Thermal Oxidation and Hydrogen Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A minority carrier lifetime of 25.46 $\mu$s in a P-type 4H-SiC epilayer has been attained through sequential thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing. Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>
