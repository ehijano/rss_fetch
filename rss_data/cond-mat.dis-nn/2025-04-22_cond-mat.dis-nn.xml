      <title>Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Interacting Copies of Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of $y=2$ coupled copies of a well-known constraint satisfaction problem (random hypergraph bicoloring) to examine how the ferromagnetic coupling between the copies affects the properties of the solution space. We solve the replicated model by applying the cavity method to the supervariables taking $2^y$ values. Our results show that a coupling of strength $\gamma$ between the copies decreases the clustering threshold $\alpha_d(\gamma)$, at which typical solutions shatters into disconnected components, therefore preventing numerical methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains from reaching equilibrium in polynomial time. This result needs to be reconciled with the observation that, in models with coupled copies, denser regions of the solution space should be more accessible. Additionally, we observe a change in the nature of the clustering phase transition, from discontinuous to continuous, in a wide $\gamma$ range. We investigate how the coupling affects the behavior of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm on finite-size instances and find that BP convergence is significantly impacted by the continuous transition. These results highlight the importance of better understanding algorithmic performance at the clustering transition, and call for a further exploration into the optimal use of re-weighting strategies designed to enhance algorithmic performances.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlinear disordered photonic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of complex photonics has garnered significant interest due to its rich physics and myriad applications spanning physics, engineering, biology, and medicine. However, a substantial portion of research focuses primarily on the linear medium. Over the years, optical nonlinearity, particularly the second order denoted as $\chi^{(2)}$, has been harnessed for diverse applications such as frequency conversions, three-wave mixing, material characterizations, and bio-imaging. When $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinearity combines with the disorder, a new realm of physics emerges, which in the last 30 years has witnessed substantial progress in fundamental studies and futuristic applications. This review aims to explore fundamental concepts concerning $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear disordered media, chart the field's evolution, highlight current interests within the research community, and conclude with a future perspective.</description>

      <title>Inverse Melting of Polar Order in Chemically Substituted BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many condensed matter systems, long range order emerges at low temperatures as thermal fluctuations subside. In the presence of competing interactions or quenched disorder, however, some systems can show unusual configurations that become more disordered at low temperature, a rare phenomenon known as "inverse melting". Here, we discover an inverse melting of the polar order in a ferroelectric oxide with quenched chemical disorder (BaTi1-xZrxO3) through direct atomicscale visualization using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to the clean BaTiO3 parent system in which long range order tracks lower temperatures, we observe in the doped system BaTi1-xZrxO3 that thermally driven fluctuations at high temperature give way to a more ordered state and then to a re-entrant disordered configuration at even lower temperature. Such an inverse melting of the polar order is likely linked to the random field generated by Zr dopants, which modulates the energy landscape arising from the competition between thermal fluctuations and random field pinning potential. These visualizations highlight a rich landscape of order and disorder in materials with quenched disorder, which may be key to understanding their advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</description>

      <title>Surfacic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>
