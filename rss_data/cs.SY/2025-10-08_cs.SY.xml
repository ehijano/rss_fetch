      <title>Pricing Short-Circuit Current via a Primal-Dual Formulation for Preserving Integrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronous Generators (SGs) currently provide important levels of Short-Circuit Current (SCC), a critical ancillary service that ensures line protections trip during short-circuit faults. Given the ongoing replacement of SGs by power-electronics-based generation, which have a hard limit for current injection, it has become relevant to optimize the procurement of SCC provided by remaining SGs. Pricing this service is however challenging due to the integrality constraints in Unit Commitment (UC). Existing methods, e.g., dispatchable pricing, restricted pricing and marginal unit pricing, attempt to address this issue but exhibit limitations in handling binary variables, resulting in SCC prices that either fail to cover the operating costs of units or lack interpretability. To overcome these pitfalls, we propose a primal-dual formulation of the SCC-constrained dispatch that preserves the binary nature of UC while effectively computing shadow prices of SCC services. Using a modified IEEE 30-bus system, a comparison is carried out between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-art pricing schemes, highlighting the advantages of the primal-dual method in preserving UC integrality for SCC pricing.</description>

      <title>Robust Sensor Placement for Poisson Arrivals with False Alarm Aware Spatiotemporal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05343v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies sensor placement when detection performance varies stochastically due to environmental factors over space and time and false alarms are present, but a filter is used to attenuate the effect. We introduce a unified model that couples detection and false alarms through an availability function, which captures how false alarms reduce effective sensing and filtering responses to the disturbance. Building on this model, we give a sufficient condition under which filtering improves detection. In addition, we derive a coverage-based lower bound on the void probability. Furthermore, we prove robustness guarantees showing that performance remains stable when detection probabilities are learned from limited data. We validate the approach with numerical studies using AIS vessel-traffic data and synthetic maritime scenarios. Together, these results provide theory and practical guidance for deploying sensors in dynamic, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Koopman Control Factorization: Data-Driven Convex Controller Design for a Class of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Koopman operators provide a global linearization for autonomous dynamical systems, nonautonomous systems are not globally linear in the inputs. State (or output) feedback controller design therefore remains nonconvex in typical formulations, even with approximations via bilinear control-affine terms. We address this gap by introducing the Koopman Control Factorization, a novel parameterization of control-affine dynamical systems combined with a feedback controller defined as a linear combination of nonlinear measurements. With this choice, the Koopman operator of the closed-loop system is a bilinear combination of the coefficients in two matrices: one representing the system, and the other the controller. We propose a set of sufficient conditions such that the factorization holds. Then, we present an algorithm that calculates the feedback matrix via semi-definite programming, producing a Lyapunov-stable closed-loop system with convex optimization. We evaluate the proposed controllers on two canonical examples of control-affine nonlinear systems (inverted pendulums), and show that our factorization and controller successfully stabilize both under properly-chosen basis functions. This manuscript introduces a broadly generalizable control synthesis method for stabilization of nonlinear systems that is quick-to-compute, verifiably stable, data-driven, and does not rely on approximations.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins for Intelligent Intersections: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent intersections play a pivotal role in urban mobility, demanding innovative solutions such as digital twins to enhance safety and efficiency. This literature review investigates the integration and application of digital twins for intelligent intersections, a critical area within smart urban traffic systems. The review systematically categorizes existing research into five key thematic areas: (i) Digital Twin Architectures and Frameworks; (ii) Data Processing and Simulation Techniques; (iii) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Adaptive Traffic Control; (iv) Safety and Protection of Vulnerable Road Users; and (v) Scaling from Localized Intersections to Citywide Traffic Networks. Each theme is explored comprehensively, highlighting significant advancements, current challenges, and critical insights. The findings reveal that multi-layered digital twin architectures incorporating real-time data fusion and AI-driven decision-making enhances traffic efficiency and safety. Advanced simulation techniques combined with sophisticated AI/ML algorithms demonstrate notable improvements in real-time responsiveness and predictive accuracy for traffic management. Additionally, the integration of digital twins has shown substantial promise in safeguarding vulnerable road users through proactive and adaptive safety strategies. Despite these advancements, key challenges persist, including interoperability of diverse data sources, scalability of digital twins for extensive traffic networks, and managing uncertainty within dynamic urban environments. Addressing these challenges will be essential for the future development and deployment of intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable intersection management systems.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control with Bounded Inputs: A Closed-Form Solution for Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying the safety of controllers is critical for many applications, but is especially challenging for systems with bounded inputs. Backup control barrier functions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers that are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a backup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional quadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for computationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an approach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the backup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in closed form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe while obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.</description>

      <title>Operational Risks in Grid Integration of Large Data Center Loads: Characteristics, Stability Assessments, and Sensitivity Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators a real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations, provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</description>

      <title>A Predictive and Sampled-Data Barrier Method for Safe and Efficient Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cascaded control framework for quadrotor trajectory tracking with formal safety guarantees. First, we design a controller consisting of an outer-loop position model predictive control (MPC) and an inner-loop nonlinear attitude control, enabling decoupling of position safety and yaw orientation. Second, since quadrotor safety constraints often involve high relative degree, we adopt high order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) to guarantee safety. To employ HOCBFs in the MPC formulation that has formal guarantees, we extend HOCBFs to sampled-data HOCBF (SdHOCBFs) by introducing compensation terms, ensuring safety over the entire sampling interval. We show that embedding SdHOCBFs as control-affine constraints into the MPC formulation guarantees both safety and optimality while preserving convexity for real-time implementations. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the safety guarantee and high efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient and Smooth Cross-Entropy Method Model Predictive Control Using Deterministic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-entropy method model predictive control (CEM--MPC) is a powerful gradient-free technique for nonlinear optimal control, but its performance is often limited by the reliance on random sampling. This conventional approach can lead to inefficient exploration of the solution space and non-smooth control inputs, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory results. To address these limitations, we propose deterministic sampling CEM (dsCEM), a novel framework that replaces the random sampling step with deterministic samples derived from localized cumulative distributions (LCDs). Our approach introduces modular schemes to generate and adapt these sample sets, incorporating temporal correlations to ensure smooth control trajectories. This method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the sampling step in existing CEM-based controllers. Experimental evaluations on two nonlinear control tasks demonstrate that dsCEM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iCEM in terms of cumulative cost and control input smoothness, particularly in the critical low-sample regime.</description>

      <title>Safe Landing on Small Celestial Bodies with Gravitational Uncertainty Using Disturbance Estimation and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft landing on small celestial bodies (SCBs) poses unique challenges, as uncertainties in gravitational models and poorly characterized, dynamic environments require a high level of autonomy. Existing control approaches lack formal guarantees for safety constraint satisfaction, necessary to ensure the safe execution of the maneuvers. This paper introduces a control that addresses this limitation by integrating trajectory tracking, disturbance estimation, and safety enforcement. An extended high-gain observer is employed to estimate disturbances resulting from gravitational model uncertainties. We then apply a feedback-linearizing and disturbance-canceling controller that achieves exponential tracking of reference trajectories. Finally, we use a control barrier function based minimum-intervention controller to enforce state and input constraints through out the maneuver execution. This control combines trajectory tracking of offline generated reference trajectories with formal guarantees of safety, which follows common guidance and control architectures for spacecraft and allows aggressive maneuvers to be executed without compromising safety. Numerical simulations using fuel-optimal trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in achieving precise and safe soft-landing, highlighting its potential for autonomous SCB missions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Platoon Control Under Quantization: Stability Analysis and Privacy Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed control of connected and automated vehicles has attracted considerable interest for its potential to improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle data, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious activities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving properties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers: deterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that the resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an eavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the use of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle platoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic quantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving privacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information. We further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by formulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the quantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Batched Scheduling of Stochastic Processing Networks Using Atomic Action Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06033v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processing networks (SPNs) have broad applications in healthcare, transportation, and communication networks. The control of SPN is to dynamically assign servers in batches under uncertainty to optimize long-run performance. This problem is challenging as the policy dimension grows exponentially with the number of servers, making standard reinforcement learning and policy optimization methods intractable at scale. We propose an atomic action decomposition framework that addresses this scalability challenge by breaking joint assignments into sequential single-server assignments. This yields policies with constant dimension, independent of the number of servers. We study two classes of atomic policies, the step-dependent and step-independent atomic policies, and prove that both achieve the same optimal long-run average reward as the original joint policies. These results establish that computing the optimal SPN control can be made scalable without loss of optimality using the atomic framework. Our results offer theoretical justification for the strong empirical success of the atomic framework in large-scale applications reported in previous articles.</description>

      <title>Toward Model Matching for Remotely Controlled Differential Drive Robotic Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of regulation of the orientation angle of a remotely controlled differential-drive mobile robot with actuator dynamics and network-induced delays is studied. Using a preinstalled two-layer nonlinear control scheme that decouples linear and angular velocities and regulates heading, a third, delay-dependent layer that achieves exact model matching from the orientation angle command to the orientation angle is introduced. The proposed outer loop controller is a delay dependent dynamic measurable output-feedback controller with dynamic proper precompensator. Parameterization yields a simple characteristic quasi-polynomial with coefficients constrained to satisfy stability for all delays up to a computable bound. Computational experiments confirm accurate tracking, fast settling and bounded internal signals and control voltages. The approach offers an analytic design alternative to AI-based tuning for delayed robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Segment Photonic Power Converters for Energy Harvesting and High-Speed Optical Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for energy-efficient high-speed wireless communication, coupled with the rapid rise of IoT devices, requires systems that integrate power harvesting with optical data reception to eliminate the need for charging or battery replacements. Recent advances have explored the use of solar cells as optical receivers for high-speed data detection alongside power harvesting. \acs{GaAs}-based \acp{PPC} provide six times greater electron mobility than silicon- or cadmium telluride-based cells, enabling faster data detection and improved power efficiency. However, their bandwidth is constrained by junction capacitance, which increases with active area, creating a trade-off between power output and data rate. To address this, we propose and test multi-segment \acs{GaAs}-based \Acp{PPC} that serve as both energy harvesters and data detectors. By segmenting the active area into 2, 4, or 6 subcells, forming circular areas with diameters of 1, 1.5, or 2.08~mm, we reduce capacitance and boost bandwidth while preserving light collection. Fabricated on a semi-insulating \ac{GaAs} substrate with etched trenches for electrical isolation, the series-connected subcells optimize absorption and minimize parasitic effects. The \Acp{PPC} were used for an eye-safe 1.5~m optical wireless link, employing \ac{OFDM} with adaptive bit and power loading. The system achieved a world record data rate of 3.8~Gbps, which is four times higher than prior works. The system converts 39.7\% of optical power from a beam of 2.3~mW, although the segmentation increases the sensitivity of the alignment. These findings provide new solutions for off-grid backhaul for future communication networks, such as 6th generation (6G) cellular.</description>

      <title>A System Level Approach to LQR Control of the Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous-time, infinite horizon LQR problem for the diffusion equation over the unit circle with fully distributed actuation is considered. It is well-known that the solution to this problem can be obtained from the solution to an operator-valued algebraic Riccati equation. Here, it is demonstrated that this solution can be equivalently obtained by solving an $H_2$ control problem through a closed-loop design procedure that is analogous to the "System Level Synthesis" methodology previously developed for systems over a discrete spatial domain and/or over a finite time horizon. The presented extension to the continuous spatial domain and continuous and infinite-horizon time setting admits analytical solutions that may complement computational approaches for discrete or finite-horizon settings. It is further illustrated that spatio-temporal constraints on the closed-loop responses can be incorporated into this new formulation in a convex manner.</description>

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05455v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where the speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>

      <title>GO-Flock: Goal-Oriented Flocking in 3D Unknown Environments with Depth Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations. This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module, which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical and three virtual, in a forest environment.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Driven Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Zero-Touch Optical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life. As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization. This work provides a promising approach for the future development of intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.</description>

      <title>Federated Split Learning for Resource-Constrained Robots in Industrial IoT: Framework Comparison, Optimization Strategies, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated split learning (FedSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling collaborative intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems, particularly in smart factories where data privacy, communication efficiency, and device heterogeneity are critical concerns. In this article, we present a comprehensive study of FedSL frameworks tailored for resource-constrained robots in industrial scenarios. We compare synchronous, asynchronous, hierarchical, and heterogeneous FedSL frameworks in terms of workflow, scalability, adaptability, and limitations under dynamic industrial conditions. Furthermore, we systematically categorize token fusion strategies into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level (intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation, including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally, we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Optimisation in Robot-assisted Gait Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop optimisation in this domain.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Policy Gradient for Adaptive Control of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Comparative Study of VQC vs. MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1 environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise and expressivity limitations are mitigated.</description>

      <title>Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories. However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings, limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data, and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these applications.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Model Predictive Control on the GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable model predictive control (MPC) offers a powerful framework for combining learning and control. However, its adoption has been limited by the inherently sequential nature of traditional optimization algorithms, which are challenging to parallelize on modern computing hardware like GPUs. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck by introducing a GPU-accelerated differentiable optimization tool for MPC. This solver leverages sequential quadratic programming and a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) routine with tridiagonal preconditioning to exploit the problem's structure and enable efficient parallelization. We demonstrate substantial speedups over CPU- and GPU-based baselines, significantly improving upon state-of-the-art training times on benchmark reinforcement learning and imitation learning tasks. Finally, we showcase the method on the challenging task of reinforcement learning for driving at the limits of handling, where it enables robust drifting of a Toyota Supra through water puddles.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating probabilistic descent trajectories in simulations of real-world airspace. A dataset of 116,066 trajectories harvested from Mode S radar returns in UK airspace was used to train and test the model. Thirteen aircraft types with varying performance characteristics were investigated. It was found that the error in the mean prediction of time to reach the bottom of descent for the proposed method was less than that of the the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the method was capable of generating a range of trajectories that were similar to the held out test dataset when analysed in distribution. The proposed method is hybrid, with aircraft drag and calibrated airspeed functions generated probabilistically to parameterise the BADA equations, ensuring the physical plausibility of generated trajectories.</description>

      <title>Optimal Duration of Reserve Capacity Ancillary Services for Distributed Energy Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power systems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS) provision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability, ramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units, making their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper proposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products considering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of system imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing product availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's balancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage network with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter product durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations improve the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable insights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER participation.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter for Relative Attitude and Target's Angular Velocity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.</description>

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient MPC-Based Energy Management System for Secure and Cost-Effective Microgrid Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management systems (EMS) are essential for ensuring optimal, secure, and stable operation in microgrids with high penetrations of distributed energy resources. However, due to the high computational cost for the decision-making, the conventional MPC-based EMS typically adopts a simplified integrated-bus power balance model. While this simplification is effective for small networks, large-scale systems require a more detailed branch flow model to account for the increased impact of grid power losses and security constraints. This work proposes an efficient and reliable MPC-based EMS that incorporates power-loss effects and grid-security constraints. %, while adaptively shaping the battery power profile in response to online renewable inputs, achieving reduced operational costs. It enhances system reliability, reduces operational costs, and shows strong potential for online implementation due to its reduced computational effort. Specifically, a second-order cone program (SOCP) branch flow relaxation is integrated into the constraint set, yielding a convex formulation that guarantees globally optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. Owing to the radial topology of the microgrid, this relaxation is practically tight, ensuring equivalence to the original problem. Building on this foundation, an online demand response (DR) module is designed to further reduce the operation cost through peak shaving. To the best of our knowledge, no prior MPC-EMS framework has simultaneously modeled losses and security constraints while coordinating flexible loads within a unified architecture. The developed framework enables secure operation with effective peak shaving and reduced total cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 10-bus, 18-bus, and 33-bus systems.</description>

Abstract: The electrification of aircraft is reshaping the foundations of aerospace design by positioning electrical systems at the center of propulsion, control, and onboard functionality. This chapter provides an overview of electrical system architectures for electric and hybrid electric aircraft, highlighting both established principles and emerging design strategies. The discussion begins with the motivations for electrification, including reducing environmental impact, improving operational efficiency, and replacing complex pneumatic and hydraulic subsystems with lighter and more reliable electrical alternatives. Aircraft electrical architectures are classified into four major categories: conventional, more electric, all electric, and hybrid electric. A range of system topologies is examined, including direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), hybrid, and distributed configurations. Each is considered in terms of its effectiveness in delivering power, enabling redundancy, supporting fault isolation, and managing thermal performance. Real world examples are presented to demonstrate practical applications, with case studies drawn from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Eviation Alice commuter aircraft, and NASA X57 Maxwell demonstrator. These examples illustrate the ongoing transition from incremental subsystem electrification toward fully integrated architectures that promise higher efficiency and greater sustainability.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19432</link>

Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>Can We Ignore Labels In Out of Distribution Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14704</link>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have recently become more prominent, serving as a core element in safety-critical autonomous systems. One major purpose of OOD detection is to reject invalid inputs that could lead to unpredictable errors and compromise safety. Due to the cost of labeled data, recent works have investigated the feasibility of self-supervised learning (SSL) OOD detection, unlabeled OOD detection, and zero shot OOD detection. In this work, we identify a set of conditions for a theoretical guarantee of failure in unlabeled OOD detection algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective. These conditions are present in all OOD tasks dealing with real-world data: I) we provide theoretical proof of unlabeled OOD detection failure when there exists zero mutual information between the learning objective and the in-distribution labels, a.k.a. 'label blindness', II) we define a new OOD task - Adjacent OOD detection - that tests for label blindness and accounts for a previously ignored safety gap in all OOD detection benchmarks, and III) we perform experiments demonstrating that existing unlabeled OOD methods fail under conditions suggested by our label blindness theory and analyze the implications for future research in unlabeled OOD methods.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection with Cost-Constrained Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14186</link>

Abstract: In the classical quickest change detection problem, an observer performs a single experiment to monitor a stochastic process. The goal in the classical problem is to detect a change in the statistical properties of the process, with the minimum possible delay, subject to a constraint on the rate of false alarms. This paper considers the case where, at each observation time, the decision-maker must choose between multiple experiments with varying information qualities and costs. The change can be detected using any of the experiments. The goal here is to detect the change with the minimum delay, subject to constraints on the rate of false alarms and the fraction of time each experiment is performed before the time of change. The constraint on the fraction of time can be used to control the overall cost of using the system of experiments. An algorithm called the two-experiment cumulative sum (2E-CUSUM) algorithm is first proposed to solve the problem when there are only two experiments. The algorithm for the case of multiple experiments, starting with three experiments, is then designed iteratively using the 2E-CUSUM algorithm. Two key ideas used in the design are the scaling of undershoots and the truncation of tests. The multiple-experiment algorithm can be designed to satisfy the constraints and can achieve the delay performance of the experiment with the highest quality within a constant. The important concept of data efficiency, where the observer has the choice of not performing any experiment, is explored as well.</description>
