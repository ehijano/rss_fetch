      <title>Energy-dependent SEP Fe/O abundances during the May 2024 superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During mid-May 2024, active region (AR) 13664 produced a series of M- and X-class flares along with several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in exceptionally strong aurora at Earth. This study presents in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) ion composition data from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STA), Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) as their magnetic connectivity to AR 13664 varied throughout the event period. Between 08 to 24 May, STA was separated by 12{\deg} in longitude from ACE at 0.96 AU. SEP intensities rose gradually due to merged CMEs from AR 13664. On 13 May, an M6 flare was followed by a rapid-onset SEP event at STA, although velocity dispersion analysis yielded no clear path length or release time. PSP, 95{\deg} longitudinally separated from Earth at 0.74 AU, observed gradually increasing SEP intensities beginning 11 May, followed by a jump in both SEP intensity and magnetic field (&gt;100 nT) on 16 May. These early event intervals display stepwise SEP increases, consistent with the passage of successive CMEs. On 20 May, an X16.5 flare from AR 13664 produced an Fe-rich SEP event observed at all three spacecraft despite their wide longitudinal separations. Throughout the period, Fe/O ratios ranged from &lt;0.01 to &gt;0.8 and increased with energy between 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. This trend deviates from the typical energy-dependent decrease expected from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests more complex scenarios, possibly involving variable suprathermal seed populations or species-dependent transport.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>
