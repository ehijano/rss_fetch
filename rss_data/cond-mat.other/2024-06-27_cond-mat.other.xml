      <title>Subharmonic oscillations in the Floquet circuit with the frequency-synthesis dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The period-doubling oscillation emerges with the coexistence between zero and {\pi} modes in Floquet topological insulator. Here, utilized the flexibility of the circuit, we construct the Floquet circuit with frequency-synthetic dimension and find the topological-protected deeply-subharmonic oscillations with the period extensively exceeding the doubling-driven period. In the construction framework, the periodically-driven mechanism is attained by implementing the circuit-oscillator hierarchy with the stepping-variation resonances in frequency domain. The zero and {\pi} modes that arise at the Floquet band in the circuit indicate the anomalous boundary-bulk correspondence. The coexistence of zero and {\pi} modes, results in a subharmonic oscillation with the extremely-low frequency on the edge of the Floquet circuit. Furthermore, we explore the Floquet band with the enhanced periodically-driven strength tailored by the component flexibility of the circuit. Our method provides a flexible scheme to study Floquet topological phases, and open a new path for realizing the deeply subwavelength system.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>

      <title>Local geometry and quantum geometric tensor of mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07597v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) is a fundamental concept for characterizing the local geometry of quantum states. After casting the geometry of pure quantum states and extracting the QGT, we generalize the geometry to mixed quantum states via the density matrix and its purification. The gauge-invariant QGT of mixed states is derived, whose real and imaginary parts are the Bures metric and the Uhlmann form, respectively. In contrast to the imaginary part of the pure-state QGT that is proportional to the Berry curvature, the Uhlmann form vanishes identically for ordinary physical processes. Moreover, there exists a Pythagorean-like equation that links different local distances and reflect the underlying fibration. The Bures metric of mixed states is shown to reduce to the corresponding Fubini-Study metric of the ground state as temperature approaches zero, establishing a correspondence despite the different underlying fibrations. We also present two examples with contrasting local geometries and discuss experimental implications.</description>
