      <title>GRoovy: A General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Code for Dynamical Spacetimes with Curvilinear Coordinates, Tabulated Equations of State, and Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many astrophysical systems of interest to numerical relativity, such as rapidly rotating stars, black hole accretion disks, and core-collapse supernovae, exhibit near-symmetries. These systems generally consist of a strongly gravitating central object surrounded by an accretion disk, debris, and ejecta. Simulations can efficiently exploit the near-axisymmetry of these systems by reducing the number of points in the angular direction around the near-symmetry axis, enabling efficient simulations over seconds-long timescales with minimal computational expense. In this paper, we introduce GRoovy, a novel code capable of modeling astrophysical systems containing compact objects by solving the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) in full general relativity using singular curvilinear (spherical-like and cylindrical-like) and Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrate the code's robustness through a battery of challenging GRHD tests, ranging from flat, static spacetimes to curved, dynamical spacetimes. These tests further showcase the code's capabilities in modeling systems with realistic, finite-temperature equations of state and neutrino cooling via a leakage scheme. GRoovy extensively leverages GRHayL, an open-source, modular, and infrastructure-agnostic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics library built from the highly robust algorithms of IllinoisGRMHD. Long-term simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star post-merger remnants will benefit greatly from GRoovy to study phenomena such as remnant stability, gamma-ray bursts, and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: hyperbolicity, causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion paper we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational quantum speed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While playing an important role in the foundations of quantum theory, Quantum Speed Limits (QSL) have no role in discussions about the search for quantum gravity. We fill this gap by analysing what QSL arises when superposing spherically symmetric masses in canonical quantum gravity. By this procedure, we find that the quantum mechanical Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds can be improved by superposing a spherically symmetric, static and asymptotically flat spacetime between states with different ADM energies and mass densities. We discuss the feasibility and significance of measuring times via these superpositions.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric configurations in $f(R)$ gravity: universal behavior for large scalaron masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric (SSS) configurations in the Einstein's frame of $f(R)$ gravity are studied in the limit of large scalaron mass $\mu$. The main attention is paid to vacuum solutions describing asymptotically flat astrophysical systems. We note that astrophysical objects usually deal with a very large dimensionless parameter $M\mu$, where $M$ is the total mass, which allows making analytical approximations. Approximate solutions are obtained that describe well the SSS systems in the regions of strong and weak scalaron fields for astrophysically interesting cases; this is confirmed by numerical simulations. The solutions show a remarkably similar properties for a class of scalaron potentials in the limit of high $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from Loop Quantum Black Holes: The Role of Magnetic Penrose Process and Quantum Gravity Effects with Astrophysical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of quantum gravitational corrections, derived from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), on the efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in black hole (BH) environments. We begin by analyzing the rotating Loop Quantum Black Hole (LQBH) metric, describing the structure of the event horizon and ergosphere as functions of the quantum parameter $\epsilon = \gamma \delta$, with $\gamma$ representing the Immirzi parameter and $\delta$ the polymeric parameter, and the spin parameter $a$. These modifications provide a novel setting for exploring the dynamics of charged particles near the LQBH and evaluating the resultant energy extraction through the MPP. Interestingly, for a given value of the LQBH parameter $a$, we observe that the ergosphere region of the LQBH exhibits a more intricate structure compared to its classical counterpart, the Kerr BH, as $\epsilon$ increases. Furthermore, we find that the overall efficiency of the process decreases with $\epsilon$ that decreases $a_{max}$, again in contrast to the Kerr BH, where efficiency rises with an increasing $a$. Our analysis also extends to astrophysical contexts, applying constraints on the mass and magnetic field of LQBHs for astrophysical BH candidates, including SgrA*, M87*, NGC 1052, and BZ (Blandford and Znajek sources, i.e., supermassive BHs with masses around $10^9 M_\odot$ and magnetic fields in the range $10^3-10^4 \text{G}$). We assess these sources as potential accelerators of high-energy protons across different values of the quantum parameter $\epsilon$. Additionally, we examine how variations in the magnetic field strength $B$ and quantum corrections impact the energy of protons accelerated from M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ following beta decay.</description>

      <title>Using the Difference of the Inclinations of a Pair of Counter-Orbiting Satellites to Measure the Lense-Thirring Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary along ideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the general expressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the central object, it turns out that the Lense-Thirring inclination rates of A and B are equal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary's oblateness are identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the two orbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects by enhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbital configurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observable consequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenario involving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt in the mid-1970s, is considered. A comparison with the ongoing experiment with the LAser GEOdynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) 2 is made.</description>

      <title>To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncing cosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entire evolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singular bounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, the vector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed without encountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that such models unavoidably lead to either an instability in the matter sector or strong coupling in the scalar one. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independent way, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singular bounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found for Horndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyond generalized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamical nature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it an ill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.</description>

      <title>DHOST theories as disformal gravity: From black holes to radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript reviews the construction of exact solutions describing both (rotating) black holes and non-linear radiative spacetimes in the context of degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We start be reviewing the structure of the DHOST theory space, the notion of degeneracy conditions and the stability of these degeneracy classes under disformal field redefinition (DFR). Then we discuss several key notions related to stationary and axi-symmetric black holes, and in particular the no-hair theorems derived in GR and in its scalar-tensor extensions. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the disformal solution generating map use to construct new hairy black holes solutions. A brief review of the rotating black holes solutions found so far in this context and a detailed description of the disformed Kerr black hole, we further comment on on-going efforts to construct rotating black hole solutions mimicking the closest the Kerr geometry. Then, we discuss how DFR affects the algebraic properties of a gravitational field and in particular its Petrov type. This provides a first systematic characterization of this effect, paving the road for constructing new solutions with a fixed Petrov type. Finally, we review more recent works aiming at characterizing the effect of a DFR on non-linear radiative geometries. We derive the general conditions for the generation of disformal tensorial gravitational wave and we study in detail a concrete example in DHOST gravity describing the new radiative effect induced by a time-dependent scalar monopoly in such higher-order theory. While most of the material presented here is a re-organized and augmented version of our published works, we have included new results and also new proposals to construct phenomenologically interesting solutions. This manuscript can be used as a review on the construction of exact solutions in DHOST gravity.</description>

      <title>Approach to the separatrix with eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric binary compact mergers are prime targets of current and future gravitational wave observatories. In the small mass ratio expansion, post-adiabatic inspirals have been modeled up to the separatrix, where first-principle modeling currently ends. In this paper, we derive the analytic late time solution to the adiabatic inspiral in terms of self-force coefficients at the separatrix. We identify the role of the Lambert $W_{-1}$ function as a key mathematical ingredient in the approach to the separatrix.</description>

Abstract: We highlight a hidden aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\ $the dynamics of the dilaton can be used to induce variations in Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$. This mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes offers novel insights into the origin of late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given nonlinear system of dynamical equations, the set of all stable perturbations of the system, the versal unfolding, is fully determined by bifurcation theory. This leads to a complete depiction of all possible qualitatively different solutions and their metamorphoses into new topological forms, the versal families being dependent on a suitable number, the codimension, of independent parameters. In this paper, we introduce and elaborate on the idea that gravitational phenomena are bifurcation problems of finite codimension. We deploy gravitational bifurcations for five standard problems in general relativity, namely, the Friedmann models, the Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole, the issue of a focusing state associated with the evolution of congruences of causal geodesics in the context of cosmology and black holes, the crease flow on black hole event horizons, and the Friedmann-Lemaitre equations. We also comment on more general emerging aspects of the application of bifurcation theory to problems involving the gravitational interaction, and the possible relations between gravitational versal unfoldings and those of the Maxwell, Dirac, and Schrodinger equations.</description>

      <title>Constraining polymerized black holes with quasi-circular extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the gravitational waves emitted by a stellar-mass object in a quasi-circular inspiral orbit around a central supermassive polymerized black hole in loop quantum gravity. Treating the stellar-mass object as a massive test particle, we derive its equations of motion and the corresponding radial effective potential. We find that the peak of the radial effective potential decreases with the quantum parameter $\hat{k}$. We also examine the impact of quantum corrections on the properties of stable circular orbits around the polymerized black hole. Given that gravitational radiation induces changes in the energy and orbital angular momentum of the smaller object, we model its trajectory as an adiabatic evolution along stable circular orbits. The corresponding gravitational waveforms are generated using the numerical kludge method, revealing that quantum corrections cause phase advances in the gravitational waveforms. We further analyze the potential constraints on the quantum parameter $\hat{k}$ from future space-based gravitational wave observations, concluding that these observations will likely impose stronger constraints on $\hat{k}$ than those obtained from black hole shadow measurements.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the original charged BTZ black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) proposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinning BTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a `static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations are satisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, the Maxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of the corresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin have proposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analytic rotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that the original charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of the Deshpande--Lunin theory. Moreover, as we shall explicitly illustrate on an example of regularized conformal electrodynamics, similar construction also works for any non-linear electrodynamics in 3-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Coordinate- and spacetime-independent quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>

Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anti-de Sitter Wormholes as seeds for Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>The Diagonal Approximation for Holographic R\'{e}nyi Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Dong, Rath and Kudler-Flam proposed a modified cosmic brane prescription for computing the R\'{e}nyi entropy $S_\alpha$ of a holographic system in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. This prescription was found by assuming a diagonal approximation, where the R\'{e}nyi entropy is computed after first measuring the areas of all extremal surfaces. We derive this diagonal approximation and show that it accurately computes R\'{e}nyi entropies up to $O(\log G)$ corrections. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this allows us to derive the modified cosmic brane prescription, which differs from the original cosmic brane prescription at leading order in $G$. For $\alpha&gt;1$, it leads to the original cosmic brane prescription without needing to assume that replica symmetry is unbroken in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric index has provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In the near-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed the semiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy (consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS black holes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of the spectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of $\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focus on near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5 branes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantum corrections to their charges, and when $\vartheta = \pi$ one may find a mixed `t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversal symmetries. Using results from $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find these effects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, and may even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\vartheta \rightarrow \pi$, neither the Bekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremal degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes and the ABJM mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \times S^7$ are expected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJM superconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfully demonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black hole metrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies in the low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of the near horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixed grand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes are described by a version of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theory with $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties of ABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic ``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightest near BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimension spectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results are consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrix theory at low energies, and the microscopic index.</description>

Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>A $\Lambda$CDM Extension Explaining the Hubble Tension and the Spatial Curvature $\Omega_{k,0} = -0.012 \pm 0.010$ Measured by the Final PR4 of the Planck Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurements of the CMB have determined the cosmological parameters with high accuracy, and the observation of the flatness of space have contributed to the status of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, necessary to close the model to critical density, remains an open conundrum. We explore the observed late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, where we consider that the Friedmann equation describes the expansion history of FLRW universes in the local reference frame of freely falling comoving observers, which perceive flat, homogeneous and isotropic space in their local inertial system, where, as a consequence of the equivalence principle, special relativity applies. We use this fact to propose an extension to $\Lambda$CDM, incorporating the initial conditions of the background universe, comprising the initial energy densities as well as the initial post big bang expansion rate. The observed late-time accelerated expansion is then attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energy component. Choosing the same $\Omega_{m,0} \simeq 0.3$ as $\Lambda$CDM, its equation of state $w_{de} \simeq -0.8$. Furthermore, we include the impact on the expansion history caused by the cosmic web of the late Universe, once voids dominate its volume, and find that the initially constant $w_{de}$ becomes time-dependent, evolving to a value of $w_{de} \simeq -0.9$ at the present. While this impact by voids is minor, it is sufficient to provide a solution to the Hubble tension problem. We use CLASS to calculate the expansion history and power spectra of our extension and compare our results to concordance $\Lambda$CDM and to observations. We find that our model agrees well with current data, in particular with the final data release PR4 of the Planck mission, where it explains the reported spatial curvature of $\Omega_{k,0} = - 0.012 \pm 0.010$.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole for string, but not for particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed string massless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the string frame, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence of the wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middle region contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions form non-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin to a non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete within each region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometry differently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a) the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b) Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case is generalised to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric space bring a natural quasi-uniformity (resp.\ quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of 4D Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Insights from Kaniadakis Statistics and Emergence of Superfluid $\lambda$-Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $4D$ dyonic AdS black hole in the Kaniadakis statistics framework using the Restricted Phase Space (RPST) formalism. This framework provides a non-extensive extension of classical statistical mechanics, drawing inspiration from relativistic symmetries and presenting a fresh perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our study analyzes how including Kaniadakis entropy modifies the phase transition of the dyonic black holes. We consider the central charge $C$ and its conjugate chemical potential $\mu$ as the thermodynamic variable along with others except the pressure and volume. Due to the addition of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$, the study of the phase transition becomes much richer by obtaining a non-equilibrium phase transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable large black hole along with the Van der Waals phase transition in the $T-S$ processes. In the $F-T$ plot, we get an extra Hawking-Page phase transition. Including the deformation parameter $\kappa$ introduces an unstable (ultra-large BH) branch seen in almost all the plots. Turning off the magnetic charge flips the direction of the phase transition seen during its presence. We observe a novel phenomenon that is the superfluid $\lambda$ phase transition in the mixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ which is due to the additional $\tilde{Q}_m$ inclusion. Also, in the plots varying $\kappa$ match with the plot varying $C$ which underlines some sort of correspondence in its meaning which is not possible to observe in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. As the entropy models change the homogeneity is not lost where mass is of the first order and the rest is zeroth order. Finally, the $\mu-C$ processes in quite similar across black hole systems and entropy formulation marking some kind of universality of this process.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in the super-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used to calculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansion parameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$, respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative series contains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidity renormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theorem which allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinear jet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite tower of operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running of the leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectory while the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitational BFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two results previously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees (up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that the convolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that of QCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where we can use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. The leading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without going beyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion follows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th order piece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. The factorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternate between being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.</description>

Abstract: Extending our previous works on the Cauchy problem for the $2+1$ equivariant Einstein-wave map system, we prove that the linear part dominates the nonlinear part of the wave maps equation coupled to the full set of the Einstein equations, for small data. A key ingredient in the proof is a nonlinear Morawetz estimate for the fully coupled equivariant Einstein-wave maps. The $2+1$ dimensional Einstein-wave map system occurs naturally in the U(1) symmetric $3+1$ dimensional vacuum Einstein equations of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of three parameter static and axially symmetric metrics that reduce to the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) and $ \gamma$-metrics in certain limits of the parameters. We obtain rotating form of the metrics that are asymptotically flat, stationary and axisymmetric. In certain values of the parameters, the solutions represent the rotating JNW metric, rotating $ \gamma$-metric and Bogush-Gal'tsov (BG) metric. The singularities of rotating metrics are investigated. Using the light-ring method, we obtain the quasi normal modes (QNMs) related to rotating metrics in the eikonal limit. Finally, we investigate the precession frequency of a test gyroscope in the presence of the rotating metrics.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to a \emph{fully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane model} with a \emph{perfect fluid equation of state} and corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms $p_{\parallel }$, $\sigma ^{2}$ and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.</description>

Abstract: We study the axial gravitational perturbations of slowly-rotating compact objects which are assumed to be supported by anisotropic fluids. We find that the gravitational perturbations decouple from the matter perturbations for axial sectors. We obtain a master wave equation whose potential is fully determined by the metric functions. This equation makes the calculations of gravitational QNMs for rotating compact objects extremely easy in specific background configurations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking constraints in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

Abstract: We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by using Ernst equations and potential, as well as using Ehlers transformations on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in Azizallahi et al. (Nucl Phys B 998:116414, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2023.116414, arXiv:2307.09328 [gr-qc], 2023) and Mirza et al.

Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the deflection angle of light in a gravitational lensing for the obtained class of TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information to better characterize the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response. We focus on the GW memory of massive black hole binary mergers and use state-of-the-art population models to assess the likelihood of detecting the GW memory within the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for the global fitting of all resolvable sources, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave signals. However, such analyses usually entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we explore the application of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Specifically, we employ linear interpolation and trig interpolation methods to construct transport paths for training CNFs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within CNFs, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using CNFs. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the curvature scalar, while $Q=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ and $P=R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin $1/2$ fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole solutions are found in the context of a non-minimal matter-curvature coupling with the Weyl connection, both in vacuum and in the presence of a cosmological constant-like matter content. This special case of non-metricity leads to black hole solutions with non-vanishing scalar curvature. Moreover, vacuum Schwarzschild solutions differ from the ones from a constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories with the appearance of a coefficient in the term linear in r and a corrected "cosmological constant". Non-vacuum Shwarzschild solutions have formally the same solutions as in the previous case with the exception being the physical interpretation of a cosmological constant as the source of the matter Lagrangian as not a simple reparametrization of the $f(R)$ description. Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions cannot be found in vacuum, but only in the presence of matter fields, such that the solutions also differ from the constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories by the term linear in r and corrected/dressed charge and cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: General theory of relativity is non--linear in nature and therefore can result in hysteresis-like effects and cause systems to remember the footprint of the gravitational field. Here we have investigated this effect using the Kinetic theory in curved spacetime. It is shown that the entropy rate experiences this hysteresis behavior. The effect is then considered for some special spacetimes, including Schwarzschild black hole, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker cosmological solution, and the flat Minkowski spacetime perturbed by a gravitational wave pulse. It is shown that there is some hysteresis effect for the entropy rate.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated, adiabatic, hydrodynamic era. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate with the sound velocity, they can only do so at high frequency.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes Sourced by Dark Matter in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence of wormholes within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, using isotropic dark matter as the source. We analyze three distinct density profiles and solve the modified gravity field equations alongside the stress-energy tensor conservation, applying appropriate boundary conditions to obtain traversable wormhole solutions. Each solution is shown to satisfy the geometric criteria for wormholes, and their regularity is verified by computing the Kretschmann scalar to ensure the absence of singularities under determined conditions. Additionally, we examine the stress-energy tensor to identify scenarios in which energy conditions are violated within this model. The wormhole geometry is further explored through embedding diagrams, and the amount of exotic matter required to sustain these structures is computed using the Volume Integral Quantifier.</description>

      <title>A Purely Relativistic Point-Source Boundary Condition for the Schwarzschild Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of a point-source boundary condition for the Schwarzschild solution that relates the Schwarzschild radius to the mass of its source without appealing to the Newtonian limit. Interpretation of the Schwarzschild radius in terms of the mass of a point-like source traditionally means resorting to distant asymptotics and the safety of Newtonian gravity, but here we instead show a direct connection between a point-particle's invariant mass and the length parameter of the Schwarzschild solution it sources, fully within the framework of general relativity. As a corollary, we also explain why attempts to show this by distributional techniques often result in a physically unmotivated spatial distribution for the source stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet (EGB) gravity models, the slow-roll approximation was extended taking into account the first order of slow-roll parameter $\delta_1 =-2\,H^2\,\xi^\prime/U_0$ proportional to derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi$ with respect to e-folds. Such extensions lead to the question about accuracy of potential reconstruction during attractors generalization in the EGB gravity. We reconstruct models in the both extended slow-roll approximations, compare them with the exact expressions and the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method ($floZ$), based on normalizing flows, to estimate the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a pre-existing set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples and their likelihood from the unnormalized posterior density. As a physical application, we use $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we realise the charged Nariai black hole on a braneworld from a nucleated bubble in AdS$_5$, known as the dark bubble model. Geometrically, the black hole takes the form of a cylindrical spacetime pulling on the dark bubble. This is realised by a brane embedding in an AdS$_5$ black string background. Identifying the brane with a D3-brane in string theory allows us to determine a relation between the fine structure constant and the string coupling, $\alpha_\text{EM} = \frac{3}{2} g_s$, which was previously obtained for a microscopic black hole. We also speculate on the consequences for the Festina Lente bound and neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Detecting eclipsing double white dwarfs with electromagnetic and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of detached eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO). Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect at least five thousand and potentially several tens of thousands of double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7. Gaia and VRO are expected to detect at least several dozen and up to several hundred eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods less than 30 hours. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic three-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Bridge the Cosmological Tensions with Thawing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is found that a non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory, Thawing Gravity (TG), can explain multiple tensions plaguing the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM while fitting better to observations than the latter. Using the standard Bayes model comparison method, TG has moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with a Bayes factor $\ln B=+1.5$ in the baseline analysis including CMB, BAO and SNIa. In the baseline+$H_0$ analysis which further takes into account the Cepheids calibration of the SNIa distance ladder from SH0ES, TG has very strong evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B=+11.8$. In particular, TG yields $H_0=71.78\pm0.86 \ {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ and $S_8=0.793\pm0.012$, consistent with both the local $H_0$ measurement and the large scale structure surveys. TG predicts a prerecombination Newtonian constant $G_{\rm CMB}$ different from today's value $G_N$. A $\sim2\sigma$ hint for $G_{\rm CMB}/G_N&gt;1$ is recovered in the baseline analysis with CMB+BAO+SNIa, which becomes a $&gt;4\sigma$ detection when one further takes into account the local $H_0$ measurement. The obtained $G_{\rm CMB}/G_N$ is consistent with current BBN constraint and can be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>
