      <title>A Parallel Hierarchical Approach for Community Detection on Large-scale Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parallel hierarchical Leiden-based algorithm for dynamic community detection. The algorithm, for a given batch update of edge insertions and deletions, partitions the network into communities using only a local neighborhood of the affected nodes. It also uses the inner hierarchical graph-based structure, which is updated incrementally in the process of optimizing the modularity of the partitioning. The algorithm has been extensively tested on various networks. The results demonstrate promising improvements in performance and scalability while maintaining the modularity of the partitioning.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

      <title>Finding Minimum Matching Cuts in $H$-free Graphs and Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A matching cut is a matching that is also an edge cut. In the problem Minimum Matching Cut, we ask for a matching cut with the minimum number of edges in the matching. We give polynomial-time algorithms for $P_7$-free, $S_{1,1,2}$-free and $(P_6 + P_4)$-free graphs, which also solve several open cases for the well-studied problem Matching Cut. In addition, we show NP-hardness for $3P_3$-free graphs, implying that Minimum Matching Cut and Matching Cut differ in complexity on certain graph classes. We also give complexity dichotomies for both general and bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter.</description>

      <title>Infinitely growing configurations in Emil Post's tag system problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emil Post's tag system problem posed the question of whether or not a tag system $\{N=3, P(0) = 00, P(1) = 1101\}$ has a configuration, simulation of which will never halt or end up in a loop. Over the subsequent decades, there were several attempts to find an answer to this question, including a recent study, during which the first $2^{84}$ initial configurations were checked. This paper presents a family of configurations of this type in the form of strings $A^{n} B C^{m}$ that evolve to $A^{n+1} B C^{m+1}$ after a finite number of steps. The proof of this behavior for all non-negative $n$ and $m$ is described later in this paper as a finite verification procedure, which is computationally bounded by 20 000 iterations of tag.</description>

      <title>Dichromatic number of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dichromatic number of a digraph is the minimum integer $k$ such that it admits a $k$-dicolouring, i.e. a partition of its vertices into $k$ acyclic subdigraphs. We say that a digraph $D$ is a super-orientation of an undirected graph $G$ if $G$ is the underlying graph of $D$. If $D$ does not contain any pair of symmetric arcs, we just say that $D$ is an orientation of $G$. In this work, we give both lower and upper bounds on the dichromatic number of super-orientations of chordal graphs. We also show a family of orientations of cographs for which the dichromatic number is equal to the clique number of the underlying graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a broad survey of inequalities for the number of linear extensions of finite posets. We review many examples, discuss open problems, and present recent results on the subject. We emphasize the bounds, the equality conditions of the inequalities, and the computational complexity aspects of the results.</description>
