      <title>Searching for compact hierarchical triple systems candidates in astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact hierarchical triple (CHT) systems, where a tertiary component orbits an inner binary, provide critical insights into stellar formation and evolution. Despite their importance, the detection of such systems, especially compact ones, remains challenging due to the complexity of their orbital dynamics and the limitations of traditional observational methods. This study aims to identify new CHT star systems among Gaia astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions by analysing the radial velocity (RV) amplitude of these systems, thereby improving our understanding of stellar hierarchies. We selected a sample of bright astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions from the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue. The RV peak-to-peak amplitude was used as an estimator, and we applied a new method to detect potential triple systems by comparing the RV-based semi-amplitude with the astrometric semi-amplitude. We used available binary and triple star catalogues to identify and validate candidates, with a subset confirmed through further examination of the RV and astrometric data. Our analysis resulted in the discovery of 956 CHT candidates among the orbital sources as well as another 3,115 probable close binary sources in stars with accelerated solutions. Exploring the inclination, orbital period, and eccentricity of the outer companion in these CHT systems provides strong evidence of mutual orbit alignment, as well as a preference towards moderate outer eccentricities. Our novel approach has proven effective in identifying potential triple systems thereby increasing their number in the catalogues. Our findings emphasise the importance of combined astrometric and RV data analysis in the study of multiple star systems.</description>

      <title>The VELOCE modulation zoo II. Humps and splitting patterns in spectral lines of classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line splitting in spectral lines is observed in various types of stars due to phenomena such as shocks, spectroscopic binaries, magnetic fields, spots, and non-radial modes. In pulsating stars, line splitting is often attributed to pulsation-induced shocks. However, this is rarely observed in classical Cepheids, with only a few reports, including X Sagittarii and BG Crucis, where it has been linked to atmospheric shocks. We investigate line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru using spectroscopic time series, and search for similar phenomena in other classical Cepheids. High signal-to-noise cross-correlation function (CCF) time series from the VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) project are analyzed. This dataset spans several years, allowing us to study the periodicities and evolution of CCF features. For X Sgr and BG Cru, we perform a detailed analysis of the individual components of the split CCFs. Additionally, we search for periodicities in CCF variations and examine other classical Cepheids for distortions resembling unresolved line splitting. We confirm line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru, trace the features over time, and uncover the periodicity behind them. Several other Cepheids also exhibit CCF humps, suggesting unresolved or marginally resolved line splitting. We discuss the incidence and characteristics of these stars. The periodicity of line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru differs significantly from the dominant pulsation period, ruling out pulsation-induced shocks. The periodicities are too short for rotation-related phenomena, suggesting non-radial modes as the most likely explanation, though their exact nature remains unknown. We also identify humps in six additional stars, indicating an incidence rate of 3% in the VELOCE sample.</description>

      <title>"Nuclear thermometers" reveal the origin of the universal r-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resembling behaviour of giant dipole resonances built on ground and excited states supports the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and assigns giant dipole resonances as spectroscopic probes -- or ``nuclear thermometers'' -- to explore the cooling of the kilonova ejecta in neutron-star mergers down to the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid-neutron capture or r-process. In previous work, we found a slight energy increase in the giant dipole resonance built on excited states at the typical temperatures of $1.0\gtrapprox T\gtrapprox0.7$ MeV where seed nuclei are produced, before ongoing neutron capture. Crucial data are presented here supporting an enhanced symmetry energy at $T=0.51$ MeV (or $5.9\times 10^9$ K) -- where the r-process occurs -- that lowers the binding energy in the Bethe-Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and results in the close in of the neutron drip line. Ergo, providing an origin to the universality of elemental abundances by limiting the reaction network for r-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced symmetry energy away from the ground state is further supported by shell-model calculations of the nuclear electric dipole ({\sc E1}) polarizability -- inversely proportional to the symmetry energy -- as a result of the destructive contribution of the products of off-diagonal {\sc E1} matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Tidally Delayed Spin-Down of Very Low Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very low-mass main-sequence stars reveal some curious trends in observed rotation period distributions that require abating the spin-down that standard rotational evolution models would otherwise imply. By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the observed bimodality in rotation period distribution of old, late-type M stars. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.</description>

      <title>A primer on the formation and evolution of hydrogen deficient Central Stars of Planetary Nebul{\ae} and Related Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief review on the formation and evolution of hydrogen deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. We include a detailed description of the main observable features of both the central stars and their surrounding nebulae and review their main classifications. We also provide a brief description of the possible progenitor systems of hydrogen deficient central stars, as well as, of transients closely connected to the formation of these stars. In particular we offer a detailed theoretical explanation of the main evolutionary scenarios, both single and binary, devised to explain these stars and nebulae. Particular emphasis is made in the description of the so-called born again scenario, their quantitative predictions and uncertainties. Finally we discuss the pros and cons of both binary and single evolution channels, draw some conclusions and discuss open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution along the AGB as revealed by the shape of Miras' visual light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analysis of a sample of visual light curves of Long Period Variable (LPV) Mira stars is presented. The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the AAVSO data base as including a very large number of high-density and high-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise, more quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier studies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new correlations between the shapes of the light curves and the time spent by the star on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal curves, associated with M-type spectral types and displaying no sign of having entered the thermally-pulsing phase (TP-AGB) is identified with good confidence. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and usually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum, implying a slowing down of the rate of luminosity increase on the ascending branch. This slowing down feature, referred to as a hump, spans across the ascending branch as the spectral-type of the star evolves from M to C. It may go all the way to maximal light or stop earlier, covering only part of the ascending branch. While this general average trend is established with good confidence, deviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the shapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying physics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope that they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on simulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.</description>

      <title>Study on the Temporal Evolution of the Radial Differential Rotation of Solar Corona Using Radio Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The daily measurements of the disc-integrated solar radio flux, observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, and 8800 MHz during the time interval of 1989 January 1 to 2019 December 17, are used to investigate the temporal evolution of radial differential rotation of solar corona using the methods of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and wavelet analysis. Overall, the results reveal that over the 30-year period, the rotation rates for the observed solar radio flux within the frequency range of 245\textendash8800 MHz show an increase with frequency. This verifies the existence of the radial differential rotation of the solar corona over long timescales of nearly 3 solar cycles. Based on the radio emission mechanism, to some extent, the results can also serve as an indicator of how the rotation of the solar upper atmosphere varies with altitude within a specific range. From the temporal variation of rotation cycle lengths of radio flux, the coronal rotation at different altitudes from the low corona to approximately 1.3 $R_{\odot}$ exhibits complex temporal variations with the progression of the solar cycle. However, in this altitude range, over the past 30 years from 1989 to 2019, the coronal rotation consistently becomes gradually slower as the altitude increases. Finally, the EEMD method can extract rotation cycle signals from these highly randomized radio emissions, and so it can be used to investigate the rotation periods for the radio emissions at higher or lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Solar Prominence Formation Triggered by Single Localized Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations to study mechanisms of solar prominence formation triggered by a single heating event. In the widely accepted ``chromospheric-evaporation condensation" model, localized heating at footpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers condensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the heating.Various theoretical studies have been conducted along one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The quasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events among multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable to consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental unit.We investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating event using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the magnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary for condensation. We found that when a heating rate approximately $\sim 10^{4}$ times greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred. Condensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop became lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly exceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length $L$ and the Field length $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}}$, the condition for condensation is expressed as $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}} \lesssim L/2$ under conditions where cooling exceeds heating. We extended the analytically derived condition for thermal non-equilibrium to a formulation based on heating amount.</description>

      <title>High-resolution observational analysis of flare ribbon fine structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Since the mechanism of energy release from solar flares is still not fully understood, the study of fine-scale features developing during flares becomes important for progressing towards a consistent picture of the essential physical mechanisms. Aims. We aim to probe the fine structures in flare ribbons at the chromospheric level using high-resolution observations with imaging and spectral techniques. Methods. We present a GOES C2.4 class solar flare observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The high-resolution SST observations offer spectroscopic data in the H-alpha, Ca II 8542 {\AA}, and H-beta lines, which we use to analyse the flare ribbon. Results. Within the eastern flare ribbon, chromospheric bright blobs were detected and analysed in Ca II 8542 {\AA}, H-alpha, and H-beta wavelengths. A comparison of blobs in H-beta observations and Si IV 1400 {\AA} has also been performed. These blobs are observed as almost circular structures having widths from 140 km-200 km. The intensity profiles of the blobs show a red wing asymmetry. Conclusions. From the high spatial and temporal resolution H-beta observations, we conclude that the periodicity of the blobs in the flare ribbon, which are near-equally spaced in the range 330-550 km, is likely due to fragmented reconnection processes within a flare current sheet. This supports the theory of a direct link between fine-structure flare ribbons and current sheet tearing. We believe our observations represent the highest resolution evidence of fine-structure flare ribbons to date.</description>

Abstract: This study re examines the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of neutron deficient (178 192Hg, 185 194Pb and 196 206Po) nuclei. The nuclear ground state properties and shape parameters were calculated using the Relativistic Mean Field model. Three different density dependent interactions were used in the calculation. Estimated shape parameters were later used within the framework of deformed proton-neutron quasi random phase approximations model, with a separable interaction, to calculate the GT strength distributions, half lives and branching ratios for these neutron deficient isotopes. It was concluded that half lives and GT strength distributions vary considerably with change in shape parameter.</description>

      <title>The importance of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars are mostly found in binary and multiple systems, as at least 50% of all solar-like stars have companions - a fraction that goes up to 100% for the most massive stars. Moreover, a large fraction of them will interact in some way or another over the course of their lives. Such interactions can, and often will, alter the structure and evolution of both components in the system. This will, in turn, lead to the production of exotic objects whose existence cannot be explained by standard single star evolution models, including gravitational wave progenitors, blue stragglers, symbiotic and barium stars, novae, and supernovae. More generally, binary stars prove crucial in many aspects, ranging from cultural ones, to constraining models of stellar evolution, star formation, and even, possibly, of gravity itself. They also provide a quasi-model independent way to determine stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. We here provide a brief summary of the importance of binary stars.</description>

      <title>Variability of hot sub-luminous stars and binaries: Machine learning analysis of Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants located at the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB). Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, unveiling their intrinsic and extrinsic variability is crucial for understanding the physical processes responsible for their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). By leveraging cutting-edge clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 hot subdwarf variable candidates using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that utilises the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and Cataclysmic Variables in a large dataset. In addition to the Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopt extra statistical features that enhance the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results lead to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS lightcurves and 108 new variables based on Gaia lightcurves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known Cataclysmic Variables (140) distinctively cluster in the 2-D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider new Cataclysmic Variable candidates. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from both ground and space-based observations, as well as the application of machine learning classifications of variable candidates in large surveys.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($&gt;$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Explainable Solar Flare Forecasting Models with Attribution-based Proximity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable predictions of solar flares are essential due to their potentially significant impact on Earth and space-based infrastructure. Although deep learning models have shown notable predictive capabilities in this domain, current evaluations often focus on accuracy while neglecting interpretability and reliability--factors that are especially critical in operational settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based framework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of deep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models trained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict $\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate attribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into their decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in operational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively assesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of interest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align with active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable insights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model interpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of more transparent and reliable operational systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool giant secondary star.</description>

      <title>The First Spin-Orbit Obliquity of an M dwarf/brown dwarf System: An eccentric and aligned TOI-2119 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.2^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the properties of the particle event. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the front side and far side of the Sun as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta \phi, the separation in longitude between the source active region and the magnetic footpoint of the observing spacecraft based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by the STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES spacecraft at 1 au. We also considered the occurrence of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; -40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; +180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, given that for events with \Delta \phi &lt; 0 corotation sweeps the particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta \phi &gt; 0 it takes them away from it.</description>

      <title>Exploring Simple-Population and Multiple-Population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs) that consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using the ChM have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on high-precision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately 10^5 M$_{\odot}$. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W - F814W color spreads, likely indicative of [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05 -- 0.30 dex. This suggests that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>New insight into the orbital parameters of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes ($\Delta\Pi_{1}$), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars' evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>The bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk-metallicity determination of giant exoplanets is essential to constrain their formation and evolution pathways and to compare them to the solar system. Previous studies inferred an inverse relation between the mass and bulk metallicity. However, the data almost exclusively contained planets that orbit FGK stars. The recent discoveries of giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars present an opportunity to probe whether they follow a mass-metallicity trend different from that of their FGK counterparts. Using evolution models we characterised the interiors of giant exoplanets with reliable mass-radius measurements that orbit FGK and M-dwarf stars. We then inferred the mass-metallicity trends for both populations. We found that the bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars is overall lower compared to those around FGK stars. This yielded mass-metallicity relations for the two populations with similar slopes but significantly different offsets. The lack of metal-rich giant planets around M dwarfs could explain the difference in the inferred offset and be a result of different formation conditions. However, there were only 20 successful bulk-metallicity retrievals for the giant planets around M dwarfs, which resulted in rather large uncertainties. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue detecting these planets with both transit and radial velocities. Additionally, the characterisation of the atmospheres of giant planets around M-stars can further help to constrain their interiors and to investigate the atmosphere-interior connection. This will significantly contribute towards understanding the possible formation pathways of giant planets.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Searching for star-planet interactions in GJ 486 at radio wavelengths with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for radio emission from star-planet interactions in the M-dwarf system GJ~486, which hosts an Earth-like planet. We observed the GJ~486 system with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) from 550 to 750 MHz in nine different epochs, between October 2021 and February 2022, covering almost all orbital phases of GJ~486 b from different orbital cycles. We obtained radio images and dynamic spectra of the total and circularly polarized intensity for each individual epoch We do not detect any quiescent radio emission in any epoch above 3$\sigma$. Similarly, we do not detect any bursty emission in our dynamic spectra.
  While we cannot completely rule out that the absence of a radio detection is due to time variability of the radio emission, or to the maximum electron-cyclotron maser emission being below our observing range, this seems unlikely. We discuss two possible scenarios: an intrinsic dim radio signal, or alternatively, that the anisotropic beamed emission pointed away from the observer. If the non-detection of radio emission from star-planet interaction in GJ~486 is due to an intrinsically dim signal, this implies that, independently of whether the planet is magnetized or not, the mass-loss rate is small (\dot{M}_\star $\lesssim$ 0.3 \dot{M}_\sun) and that, concomitantly, the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into radio emission must be low ($\beta \lesssim 10^{-3}$). Free-free absorption effects are negligible, given the high value of the coronal temperature. Finally, if the anisotropic beaming pointed away from us, this would imply that GJ~486 has very low values of its magnetic obliquity and inclination.</description>
