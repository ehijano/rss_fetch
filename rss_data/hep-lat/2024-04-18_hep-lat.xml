      <title>Practical applications of machine-learned flows on gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flows are machine-learned maps between different lattice theories which can be used as components in exact sampling and inference schemes. Ongoing work yields increasingly expressive flows on gauge fields, but it remains an open question how flows can improve lattice QCD at state-of-the-art scales. We discuss and demonstrate two applications of flows in replica exchange (parallel tempering) sampling, aimed at improving topological mixing, which are viable with iterative improvements upon presently available flows.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the finite volume two-nucleon spectrum at $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a pion mass of $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, these results provide compelling evidence for the presence of an additional state in the low-energy spectrum not present in a non-interacting two-nucleon system. Within the space of operators that are considered in this work, the strongest overlap of this state is onto hexaquark operators, and variational analyses based on operator sets containing only dibaryon operators are insensitive to this state over the temporal extent studied here. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.</description>

      <title>Protecting gauge symmetries in the the dynamics of SU(3) lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory demands imposing on-site constraints. Ideally, the dynamics remain confined within the physical Hilbert space, where all the states satisfy those constraints. For non-Abelian gauge theories, implementing local constraints is non-trivial, as is keeping the dynamics confined in the physical Hilbert space, considering the erroneous quantum devices. SU(3) gauge group, albeit crucial for describing the strong interaction of nature, is notorious for studying via Hamiltonian simulation. This work presents a couple of symmetry protection protocols for simulating the exact dynamics of SU(3) gauge theory in $1+1$ dimension. The first protocol doesn't require imposing any local symmetry but relies on protecting global symmetries, which are Abelian with a preferred choice of framework, namely the loop-string-hadron framework. Generalization to a higher dimension is possible, however, the protection scheme needs to be local for that case but is still Abelian and thus advantageous. The symmetry protection schemes presented here are important steps towards quantum simulating the full theory of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spectral Density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at $T = 230$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide solid evidence that these IR features are stable and physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) support non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T \!=\! 230\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Renormalization for Quantum Field Theories with Discrete Wavelet Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of Entanglement Renormalization for quantum field theories that, through the use of discrete wavelet transforms, strongly parallels the tensor network architecture of the \emph{Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz} (a.k.a. MERA). Our approach, called wMERA, has several advantages of over previous attempts to adapt MERA to continuum systems. In particular, (i) wMERA is formulated directly in position space, hence preserving the quasi-locality and sparsity of entanglers; and (ii) it enables a built-in RG flow in the implementation of real-time evolution and in computations of correlation functions, which is key for efficient numerical implementations. As examples, we describe in detail two concrete implementations of our wMERA algorithm for free scalar and fermionic theories in (1+1) spacetime dimensions. Possible avenues for constructing wMERAs for interacting field theories are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of Electroweak Box Contributions to Superallowed Nuclear and Neutron Beta Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the universal axial $\gamma W$-box contribution $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}$ to both superallowed nuclear and neutron beta decays. This contribution emerges as a significant component within the theoretical uncertainties surrounding the extraction of $|V_{ud}|$ from superallowed decays. Our calculation is conducted using two domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass. To construct the nucleon 4-point correlation functions, we employ the random sparsening field technique. Furthermore, we incorporate long-distance contributions to the hadronic function using the infinite-volume reconstruction method. Upon performing the continuum extrapolation, we arrive at $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}=3.65(8)_{\mathrm{lat}}(1)_{\mathrm{PT}}\times10^{-3}$. Consequently, this yields a slightly higher value of $|V_{ud}|=0.97386(11)_{\mathrm{exp.}}(9)_{\mathrm{RC}}(27)_{\mathrm{NS}}$, reducing the previous $2.1\sigma$ tension with the CKM unitarity to $1.8\sigma$. Additionally, we calculate the vector $\gamma W$-box contribution to the axial charge $g_A$, denoted as $\square_{\gamma W}^{VV}$, and explore its potential implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum tachyonic preheating, revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In certain models of inflation, the postinflationary reheating of the Universe is not primarily due to perturbative decay of the inflaton field into particles, but proceeds through a tachyonic instability. In the process, long-wavelength modes of an unstable field, which is often distinct from the inflaton itself, acquire very large occupation numbers, which are subsequently redistributed into a thermal equilibrium state. We investigate this process numerically through quantum real-time lattice simulations of the Kadanoff-Baym equation, using a 1/N-NLO truncation of the 2PI-effective action. We identify the early-time maximum occupation number, the "classical" momentum range, the validity of the classical approximation and the effective IR temperature, and study the kinetic equilibration of the system and the equation of state.</description>

      <title>About the magnitude of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transverse amplitudes near $Q^2=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low-lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes.The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square-transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold [the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 &lt;0$], where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large-$Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge-invariant parametrization of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two elementary form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the two elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description of the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$,a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low-$Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.</description>

      <title>QCD parameters and SM-high precision from $e^+e^-$ to Hadrons: Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1. I update my previous comparison of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly with the new measurement and found $\Delta a_\mu\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_\mu^{th} = (143\pm 42_{th}\pm 22_{exp})\times 10^{-11}$ indicating about 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the SM predictions and experiment. 2. I improve the estimate of QCD power corrections up to dimension D=12 and provide a new estimate of the ones up to D=20 within the SVZ expansion by combining the ratio of the Borel/Laplace sum rules (LSR) with the BNP $\tau$-like decay moments for the I=1 vector current. The results summarized in Table 1 confirm a violation of the factorization of the four-quark condensates and the value of the gluon one $ &lt;\alpha_s G^2&gt;$ from some other sources. Up to D=20, I do not observe any factorial nor exponential growth of the size of these power corrections. 3. I use these new values of power corrections to extract $\alpha_s$ from the BNP lowest moment. To order $\alpha_s^4$, I find within the SVZ expansion: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)= 0.3081(50)_{fit}(71)_{\alpha_s^5}$ [resp. $0.3260 (47)_{fit}(62)_{\alpha_s^5}]$ implying $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1170(6)(3)_{evol}$ [resp. $0.1192(6)(3)_{evol}$] for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour Improved (CI)] PT series. They lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{SVZ}=0.3179(58)_{fit}(81)_{syst}$ and $ \alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{SVZ}= 0.1182(12)(3)_{evol}$ where the systematic error(syst) takes into account the discrepancy between FO and CI. Using the lowest BNP moment, we also obtain from the $V+A$ component of $\tau$-decay: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.3040(76)_{fit}(68)_{syst}$ giving: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.1166(8)(3)_{evol}$. The average of the two determinations leads to: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3099(60)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1174(10)(3)_{evol}$. 4. Some contributions beyond the SVZ expansion ($1/Q^2$, instantons and duality violation) are discussed in Sections 10,11.</description>

      <title>An optimized basis for hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new basis for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) tensor that is optimized for the evaluation of narrow-resonance contributions to HLbL scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. As main advantage, kinematic singularities are manifestly absent for pseudoscalar, scalar, and axial-vector states, while the remaining singularities for tensor resonances are minimized, even avoided for special cases, and simple crossing relations among the scalar functions maintained. We scrutinize the properties of this new basis for the scalar-QED pion box, demonstrating that the partial-wave convergence even slightly improves compared to our previous work, and discuss the physical sum rules that ensure basis independence of the HLbL contribution. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for narrow (pseudo-)scalar, axial-vector, and tensor intermediate states in terms of their respective transition form factors.</description>
