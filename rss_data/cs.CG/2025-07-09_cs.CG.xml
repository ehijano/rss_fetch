      <title>An Optimal Algorithm for Shortest Paths in Unweighted Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given in the plane a set $S$ of $n$ points and a set of disks centered at these points, the disk graph $G(S)$ induced by these disks has vertex set $S$ and an edge between two vertices if their disks intersect. Note that the disks may have different radii. We consider the problem of computing shortest paths from a source point $s\in S$ to all vertices in $G(S)$ where the length of a path in $G(S)$ is defined as the number of edges in the path. The previously best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time. A lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ is also known for this problem under the algebraic decision tree model. In this paper, we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, which matches the lower bound and thus is optimal. Another virtue of our algorithm is that it is quite simple.</description>

      <title>$k$-means considered harmful: On arbitrary topological changes in Mapper complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mapper construction is one of the most widespread tools from Topological Data Analysis. There is an unfortunate trend as the construction has gained traction to use clustering methods with properties that end up distorting any analysis results from the construction. In this paper we will see a few ways in which widespread choices of clustering algorithms have arbitrarily large distortions of the features visible in the final Mapper complex.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Collision Probability Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles using Adaptive Sigma-Point Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability. Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs, where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Euclidean Locality-Sensitive Orderings</title>

Abstract: $ \newcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}} \newcommand{\reals}{\mathbb{R}} \newcommand{\SetX}{\mathsf{X}} \newcommand{\rad}{r} \newcommand{\Eps}{\Mh{\mathcal{E}}} \newcommand{\p}{\Mh{p}} \newcommand{\q}{\Mh{q}} \newcommand{\Mh}[1]{#1} \newcommand{\query}{q} \newcommand{\eps}{\varepsilon} \newcommand{\VorX}[1]{\mathcal{V} \pth{#1}} \newcommand{\Polygon}{\mathsf{P}} \newcommand{\IntRange}[1]{[ #1 ]} \newcommand{\Space}{\overline{\mathsf{m}}} \newcommand{\pth}[2][\!]{#1\left({#2}\right)} \newcommand{\polylog}{\mathrm{polylog}} \newcommand{\N}{\mathbb N} \newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb Z} \newcommand{\pt}{p} \newcommand{\distY}[2]{\left\| {#1} - {#2} \right\|} \newcommand{\ptq}{q} \newcommand{\pts}{s}$
  For a parameter $\eps \in (0,1)$, we present a new construction of $\eps$-locality-sensitive orderings (&lt;LSOs) in $\Re^d$ of size $M = O(\Eps^{d-1} \log \Eps)$, where $\Eps = 1/\eps$. This improves over previous work by a factor of $\Eps$, and is optimal up to a factor of $\log \Eps$. Such a set of LSOs has the property that for any two points, $\p, \q \in [0,1]^d$, there exist an order in the set such that all the points between $\p$ and $\q$ in the order are $\eps$-close to either $\p$ or $\q$.
  The existence of such LSOs is a fundamental property of low dimensional Euclidean space, conceptually similar to the existence of well-separated pairs decomposition, so the question of how to compute (near) optimal construction of LSOs is quite natural.
  As a consequence we get a flotilla of improved dynamic geometric algorithms, such as maintaining bichromatic closest pair, and spanners, among others. In particular, for geometric dynamic spanners the new result matches (up to the aforementioned $\log \Eps$ factor) the lower bound, Thus offering a near-optimal simple dynamic data-structure for maintaining spanners under insertions and deletions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>
