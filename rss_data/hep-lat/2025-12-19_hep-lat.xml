      <title>Critical coupling in $\phi_2^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\phi^4$ theory with $\phi(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hat{\lambda}$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hat{\mu}_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hat{\lambda}\to0}\hat{\lambda}/\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.</description>

      <title>Precise prediction of the decay rate for $\eta_b\to \gamma \gamma$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the decay rate for $\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma$ in lattice QCD for the first time, providing a precise prediction for the Belle II experiment. Our calculation includes $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, using gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration, at three values of the lattice spacing from $0.06\;\mathrm{fm}$ to $0.03\;\mathrm{fm}$. All quarks are treated in the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism, which enables us to reach the $b$ quark mass for our valence quarks on these fine lattices. We calculate quark-line connected correlation functions only. By working at additional heavy quark masses between those of $c$ and $b$ we map out the behaviour of the ratio $f_{\eta_h}/(M_{\eta_h}^2F_{\eta_h}(0,0))$, where $f$ is the decay constant, $M$, the mass and $F(0,0)$, the form factor for decay to two on-shell photons for the pseudoscalar heavyonium meson, $\eta_h$. This ratio takes the approximate value 0.5 in leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) but we are able to give a much more accurate analysis than this. Focussing on the $b$ quark mass, we find a ratio of $0.467(11)$, giving $\Gamma (\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma) = 0.559(32)_{\text{fit}}(1)_{\text{syst}} \: \mathrm{keV}$. Combined with a value for the branching fraction from NRQCD, our result can be used to determine the total width of the $\eta_b$ with a $6\%$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Hamiltonian method for two-particle systems containing long-range potential on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05789v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic method to block-diagonalize the finite volume effective Hamiltonian for two-particle systems with arbitrary spin in both the rest and moving frame. The framework is convenient and efficient for addressing the left-hand cut issue arising from long-range potential, which are challenging in the framework of standard L\"uscher formula. Furthermore, the method provides a foundation for further extension to three-particle systems. We first benchmark our method by examining several toy models, demonstrating its consistency with standard L\"uscher formula in the absence of long-range potential. In the presence of long-range potential, we investigate and resolve the effects and issues of left-hand cut. As a realistic application, we calculate the finite volume spectra of isoscalar $D\bar{D}^*$ system, where the well-known exotic state $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is observed. The results are qualitatively consistent with the lattice QCD calculation, highlighting the reliability and potential application of our framework to the study of other exotic states in hadron physics.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Stress Test of Truncated Hilbert Space Bases against Green's function Monte Carlo in U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) suitable for simulations with tensor network state methods or with quantum computers requires a truncation of the Hilbert space to a finite dimensional approximation. In particular for U(1) LGTs, several such truncation schemes are known, which we compare with each other using tensor network states. We show that a functional basis obtained from single plaquette Hamiltonians -- which we call plaquette state basis -- outperforms the other schemes in two spatial dimensions for plaquette, ground state energy and mass gap, as it is delivering accurate results for a wide range of coupling strengths with a minimal number of basis states. We also show that this functional basis can be efficiently used in three spatial dimensions. Green's function Monte Carlo appears to be a highly useful tool to verify tensor network states results, which deserves further investigation in the future.</description>

      <title>Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>
