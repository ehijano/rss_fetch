      <title>Detecting quasicrystals with quadratic time-frequency distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usefulness of time-frequency analysis methods in the study of quasicrystals was pointed out in a previous paper, where we proved that a tempered distribution $\mu$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$ whose Wigner transform is a measure supported on the cartesian product of two uniformly discrete sets in ${\mathbb R}^d$ is a Fourier quasicrystal. In this paper we go further in this direction using the matrix-Wigner transforms to detect quasicrystal structures. The results presented here cover essentially all the most important quadratic time-frequency distributions, and are obtained considering two different (disjoint) classes of matrix-Wigner transforms, discussed respectively in Theorems 1 and 2. The transforms considered in Theorem 1 include the classical Wigner transform, as well as all the time-frequency representations of matrix-Wigner type belonging to the Cohen class. On the other hand Theorem 2, which does not apply to the classical Wigner, has, as main example, the Ambiguity function. In this second case we only suppose that the support of the matrix-Wigner transform of $\mu$ is contained in the cartesian product of two discrete sets, obtaining that both the support and the spectrum of $\mu$ are uniformly discrete.</description>

      <title>On accumulated spectrograms for Gabor frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogs of classical results on accumulated spectrograms, the sum of spectrograms of eigenfunctions of localization operators, are established for Gabor multipliers on tight frames. We show that the lattice $\ell^1$ distance between the accumulated spectrogram and the indicator function of the Gabor multiplier mask is bounded by the length of the perimeter of the mask and that this bound is sharp in general. The methods developed for the proofs are also used to show that the Weyl-Heisenberg ensemble restricted to a lattice is hyperuniform.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for matrix geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined equivalently from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. This diversity already suggests the potential for varied applications, as well as acting as a bridge between different domains. Here we devise new quantum subroutines to efficiently prepare quantum unitary operators that embed the standard matrix geometric mean and its generalisations called the weighted matrix geometric mean. This enables the construction of solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation, which is an important class of nonlinear systems of equations that appears in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms called quantum geometric mean metric learning. This has applications in efficiently finding the best distance measure and solving classification problems in the weakly supervised limit and for anomaly detection, for both classical and quantum problems. We also show how our method can be generalised to a particular p^th-order system of nonlinear equations. These quantum subroutines for matrix geometric means are also useful in other areas of quantum information. For example, we show how to use them in the estimation of geometric Renyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity by means of the Fuchs-Caves observable. In particular, our quantum algorithms for estimating the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities have optimal dependence on the precision. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines, thus characterising their computational capability.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wright Analysis in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a broad class of non-Gaussian measures, $ \mu_\Psi$, associated with a family of generalized Wright functions, $_m\Psi_q$. First, we study these measures in Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$, then define them in an abstract nuclear triple $\mathcal{N}\subset\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{N}'$. We study analyticity, invariance properties, and ergodicity under a particular group of automorphisms. Then we show the existence of an Appell system which allows the extension of the non-Gaussian Hilbert space $L^2(\mu_\Psi)$ to the nuclear triple consisting of test functions' and distributions' spaces, $(\mathcal{N})^{1}\subset L^2(\mu_\Psi)\subset(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$. Thanks to this triple, we can study Donsker's delta as a well-defined object in the space of distributions $(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing for inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressed sensing allows for the recovery of sparse signals from few measurements, whose number is proportional to the sparsity of the unknown signal, up to logarithmic factors. The classical theory typically considers either random linear measurements or subsampled isometries and has found many applications, including accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, which is modeled by the subsampled Fourier transform. In this work, we develop a general theory of infinite-dimensional compressed sensing for abstract inverse problems, possibly ill-posed, involving an arbitrary forward operator. This is achieved by considering a generalized restricted isometry property, and a quasi-diagonalization property of the forward map.
  As a notable application, for the first time, we obtain rigorous recovery estimates for the sparse Radon transform (i.e., with a finite number of angles $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_m$), which models computed tomography, in both the parallel-beam and the fan-beam settings. In the case when the unknown signal is $s$-sparse with respect to an orthonormal basis of compactly supported wavelets, we prove stable recovery under the condition \[ m\gtrsim s, \] up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Convex integrals of molecules in Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce convex integrals of molecules in Lipschitz-free spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$ as a continuous counterpart of convex series considered elsewhere, based on the de Leeuw representation. Using optimal transport theory, we show that these elements are determined by cyclical monotonicity of their supports, and that under certain finiteness conditions they agree with elements of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ that are induced by Radon measures on $M$, or that can be decomposed into positive and negative parts. We also show that convex integrals differ in general from convex series of molecules. Finally, we present some standalone results regarding extensions of Lipschitz functions which, combined with the above, yield applications to the extremal structure of $\mathcal{F}(M)$. In particular, we show that all elements of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ are convex series of molecules when $M$ is uniformly discrete and identify all extreme points of the unit ball of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ in that case.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of vector valued de Branges spaces of entire functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with certain aspects of the vector valued de Branges spaces of entire functions that are based on pairs of Fredholm operator valued functions. Some factorization and isometric embedding results are extended from the scalar valued theory of de Branges spaces. In particular, global factorization of Fredholm operator valued entire functions and analytic equivalence of reproducing kernels of de Branges spaces are discussed. Additionally, the operator valued entire functions associated with these de Branges spaces are studied, and a connection with the operator nodes is established.</description>

      <title>Core Decreasing Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a measure space and a totally ordered ordered collection of measurable sets, called an ordered core, the notion of a core decreasing function is introduced and used to define the down space of a Banach function space. This is done using a variant of the K\"othe dual restricted to core decreasing functions. To study down spaces, the least core decreasing majorant construction and the level function construction, already known for functions on the real line, are extended to this general setting. These are used to give concrete descriptions of the duals of the down spaces and, in the case of universally rearrangement invariant (u.r.i.) spaces, of the down spaces themselves.
  The down spaces of $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ are shown to form an exact Calder\'on couple with divisibility constant $1$; a complete description of the exact interpolation spaces for the couple is given in terms of level functions; and the down spaces of u.r.i. spaces are shown to be precisely those interpolation spaces that have the Fatou property. The dual couple is also an exact Calder\'on couple with divisibility constant $1$; a complete description of the exact interpolation spaces for the couple is given in terms of least core decreasing majorants; and the duals of down spaces of u.r.i. spaces are shown to be precisely those interpolation spaces that have the Fatou property.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will revisit the Slepian spatiospectral concentration problem for the spherical Fourier-Bessel band-limited spaces introduced for 3-D domain, and discuss its general form in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$. In particular, we investigate the bimodal distribution of eigenvalues of the concentration operators and give an asymptotic characterization of the Shannon number given a linear relation between the Bessel bandwidth and spherical harmonic bandwidth.</description>

      <title>On the existence of approximate problems that preserve the type of a bifurcation point of a nonlinear problem. Application to the stationary Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear problem $F(\lambda,u)=0$ on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces that correspond to the steady-state bifurcation case. In the literature, it is found again a bifurcation point of the approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})=0$ only in some cases. We prove that, in every situation, given $F_{h}$ that approximates $F$, there exists an approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$ that has a bifurcation point with the same properties as the bifurcation point of $F(\lambda,u)=0$. First, we formulate, for a function $\widehat{F}$ defined on general Banach spaces, some sufficient conditions for the existence of an equation that has a bifurcation point of certain type. For the proof of this result, we use some methods from variational analysis, Graves' theorem, one of its consequences and the contraction mapping principle for set-valued mappings. These techniques allow us to prove the existence of a solution with some desired components that equal zero of an overdetermined extended system. We then obtain the existence of a constant (or a function) $\widehat{\varrho}$ so that the equation $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho} = 0$ has a bifurcation point of certain type. This equation has $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u) = 0$ as a perturbation. It is also made evident a class of maps $C^{p}$ - equivalent (right equivalent) at the bifurcation point to $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho}$ at the bifurcation point. Then, for the study of the approximation of $F(\lambda,u)=0$, we give conditions that relate the exact and the approximate functions. As an application of the theorem on general Banach spaces, we formulate conditions in order to obtain the existence of the approximate equation $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$.</description>
