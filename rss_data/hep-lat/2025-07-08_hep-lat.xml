      <title>Gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and nucleons from dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and the nucleons are investigated by employing modern dispersive techniques and chiral perturbation theory. We determine the gravitational form factors of pions and kaons, extending our analysis to explore the pion mass dependence of these form factors at several unphysical pion masses up to 391 MeV, for which lattice results exist for the meson-meson scattering phase shifts. We also review our analysis on the nucleon gravitational form factors at the physical pion mass, and then systematically calculate various three-dimensional spatial and two-dimensional transverse density distributions for the nucleons. These results provide new insights into the mass distribution inside nucleons. As a by-product, we match our dispersion relation results and those obtained from chiral perturbation theory with external gravitational source at the next-to-next-to-leading order, yielding values for the low-energy constants $c_8=-4.28_{-0.38}^{+0.37} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $c_9=-0.68_{-0.05}^{+0.06} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. These results offer a robust benchmark for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Unraveling $K(1690)$ as a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observed $K (1690)$ has been identified as a supernumerary pseudoscalar resonance signal in the strange-meson spectrum predicted by quark model calculations. It is the best candidate of a strange crypto-exotic state. In this work, we systematically study the hadron masses of $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^P = 0^-$ in the method of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). For ten interpolating currents, we calculate the correlation functions up to dimension-8 nonperturbative condensates. To calculate the tri-gluon condensate, we comprehensively consider the contributions from different operators with and without covariant derivatives. The infrared (IR) safety can be guaranteed for the completely calculated tri-gluon condensate by properly addressing the IR divergences in Feynman diagrams. It is demonstrated that the tri-gluon condensate provides significant contributions to the sum-rule analyses in these light tetraquark systems. Our results support the interpretation of $K (1690)$ resonance to be a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>The setting sun diagram with complex external momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the issue of analytically continuing Feynman integrals from Euclidean to Minkowski signature, allowing for generic complex momenta. Although this is well-known in terms of the K\"all\'{e}n-Lehmann representation, we consider potential alternative takes on the same problem and discuss how these are not necessarily equivalent to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann integral outcome. We present our analysis for a simple enough case -- the setting sun diagram in $d=2$ with a real mass -- but already with an eye out to the more general case with complex masses which will further complicate matters.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Extracting the chiral anomaly from $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction of three pions and a photon, $F_{3\pi}$ is predicted by the axial anomaly in terms of the pion decay constant, a relation that is frequently used to constrain low-energy radiative processes involving pions, but only tested experimentally at the $10\%$ level. Here, we present a new avenue to test this prediction, via a fit of a dispersive description of the $\gamma^*\to3\pi$ amplitude to data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$. From the global fit to SND, CMD-2, and BaBar data we obtain $F_{3\pi}=33.1(1.7)\,\text{GeV}^{-3}$, in agreement with the chiral prediction at the level of $5\%$. We also consider dispersive fits to the recent data by Belle II, in which case we observe tensions with the dispersive constraints, the width parameters of $\omega$ and $\phi$, and the chiral anomaly.</description>
