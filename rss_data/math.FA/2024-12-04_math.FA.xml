      <title>Wigner analysis of operators. Part III: Controlling ghost frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of operator kernels with the Wigner distribution, first conceptualized by E. Wigner in 1932 and later extended by L. Cohen and others, has opened new avenues in time-frequency analysis and operator calculus. Despite substantial advancements, the presence of ``ghost frequencies" in Wigner kernels continues to pose significant challenges, particularly in the analysis of Fourier integral operators (FIOs) and their applications to partial differential equations (PDEs).
  In this work, we build on the foundational concepts of Wigner analysis to introduce a novel framework for controlling ghost frequencies through the combined use of Gaussian and Sobolev regularization techniques. By focusing on FIOs with non-quadratic phase functions, we develop rigorous estimates for the Wigner kernels that are crucial for their applicability to Schr\"odinger equations with non-trivial symbol classes. Unlike previous approaches, our methodology not only mitigates the interference caused by ghost frequencies but also establishes robust bounds in the context of generalized symplectic mappings.</description>

      <title>An Archimedean Vector Lattice Functional Calculus For Semicontinuous Positively Homogeneous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functional calculus on Archimedean vector lattices for semicontinuous positively homogeneous real-valued functions defined on $\R^n$ which are bounded on the unit sphere. It is further shown that this semicontinuous Archimedean vector lattice functional calculus extends the existing continuous Archimedean vector lattice functional calculus by Buskes, de Pagter, and van Rooij. We further utilize saddle representations of continuous positively homogeneous functions to provide concrete formulas, for functions abstractly defined via the continuous functional calculus, which are completely in terms of vector lattice operations. Finally, we provide some examples to illustrate the utility of the theory presented.</description>

      <title>A sharp bound for the functional calculus of $\rho$-contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $\rho$-contraction and $f$ a rational function mapping the closed unit disk into itself. With a new characterization of $\rho$-contractions we prove that \begin{align*} \big\|f(A)\big\|\leq \frac{\rho}{2}\big(1-|f(0)|^{2}\big)+\sqrt{\frac{\rho^{2}}{4}\big(1-|f(0)|^{2}\big){}^{2}+|f(0)|^{2}}. \end{align*} We further show that this bound is sharp. This refines an estimate by Okubo--Ando and, for $\rho=2$, is consistent with a result by Drury.</description>

      <title>Reverse Carleson measures for spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasi-Banach space of analytic functions in the unit disc and let $q&gt;0$. A finite positive Borel measure $\mu$ in the closed unit disc $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ is called a $q$-reverse Carleson measure for $X$ if and only if there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that $$\|f\|_{X}\leq C \|f\|_{L^q(\overline{\mathbb D},d\mu)} $$ for all $f\in X\cap C(\overline{\mathbb D})$. We fully characterize the $q$-reverse Carleson measures with all $q&gt;0$ for Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb D)$ with all $0&lt;p\leq \infty$, for the space $\mathrm{BMOA}(\mathbb D)$ and for the Bloch space. In addition, we describe $q$-reverse Carleson measures for the holomorphic Triebel--Lizorkin spaces $HF_0^{q,r}$ and the holomorphic Besov spaces $HB_0^{q,r}$. Related results are obtained for the Hardy spaces and certain holomorphic Triebel--Lizorkin spaces in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Analytic 2-isometry of Finite Rank and Cauchy Dual Subnormality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cauchy dual subnormality problem has attracted the attention of the researchers in recent years. In this article, we describe the problem and present a new counter example to the problem by constructing a family of analytic, cyclic 2-isometric operators whose Cauchy dual is not subnormal. The said example is in contrast with the class of operators whose Cauchy dual is subnormal, found in the paper "The Cauchy dual subnormality problem via de branges-rovnyak spaces" by Chavan S.,Ghara S., Reza M. In the process, we employ the technique of realizing a 2-isometry as a shift operator on a suitable de Branges-Rovnyak space. The construction of the counter example involves some unwieldy computations around the roots of a polynomial of degree four. We therefore use numerical techniques with the help of SageMath to facilitate the computational work.</description>

      <title>Crossed products as compact quantum metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the external Kasparov product, Hawkins, Skalski, White and Zacharias constructed spectral triples on crossed product C$^\ast$-algebras by equicontinuous actions of discrete groups. They further raised the question for whether their construction turns the respective crossed product into a compact quantum metric space in the sense of Rieffel. By introducing the concept of groups separated with respect to a given length function, we give an affirmative answer in the case of virtually Abelian groups equipped with certain orbit metric length functions. We further complement our results with a discussion of natural examples such as generalized Bunce-Deddens algebras and higher-dimensional non-commutative tori.</description>

      <title>Positivstellens\"atze and Moment problems with Universal Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Positivstellens\"atze and moment problems for sets $K$ that are given by universal quantifiers. Let $Q$ be a closed set and let $g = (g_1,...,g_s)$ be a tuple of polynomials in two vector variables $x$ and $y$. Then $K$ is described as the set of all points $x$ such that each $g_j(x, y) \ge 0$ for all $y \in Q$. Fix a finite nonnegative Borel measure $\nu$ with $supp(\nu) = Q$, and assume it satisfies the multivariate Carleman condition. The first main result of the paper is a Positivstellensatz with universal quantifiers: if a polynomial $f(x)$ is positive on $K$, then it belongs to the quadratic module $QM(g,\nu)$ associated to $(g,\nu)$, under the archimedeanness assumption on $QM(g,\nu)$. Here, $QM(g,\nu)$ denotes the quadratic module of polynomials in $x$ that can be represented as \[\tau_0(x) + \int \tau_1(x,y)g_1(x, y)\, d\nu(y) + \cdots + \int \tau_s(x,y) g_s(x, y)\, d\nu(y), \] where each $\tau_j$ is a sum of squares polynomial.
  Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for a full (or truncated) multisequence to admit a representing measure supported in $K$ are given. In particular, the classical flat extension theorem of Curto and Fialkow is generalized to truncated moment problems on such a set $K$. Finally, applications of these results for solving semi-infinite optimization problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Fourier transform of BV functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relation between the Fourier transform of {\rm BV} (bounded variation) functions and their jump sets. We introduce the notion of $L^2$-jump product and obtain a weighted Plancherel identity for {\rm BV} functions. As a corollary, we get a newfound characterization of sets of finite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. Moreover, we sharpen a result of Herz on the set-theoretic derivative of the Fourier transform of characteristic functions of sets. Last, we obtain sharp bounds on the quadratic discrepancy of {\rm BV} functions, and as a consequence, we generalize the classic estimates of Beck and Montgomery.</description>
