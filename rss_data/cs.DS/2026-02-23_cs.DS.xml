      <title>Optimal Competitive Ratio of Two-sided Online Bipartite Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an optimal upper bound (negative result) of $\sim 0.526$ on the competitive ratio of the fractional version of online bipartite matching with two-sided vertex arrivals, matching the lower bound (positive result) achieved by Wang and Wong (ICALP 2015), and Tang and Zhang (EC 2024).</description>

      <title>QPTAS for MWIS and finding large sparse induced subgraphs in graphs with few independent long holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quasipolynomial-time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the Maximum Independent Set (\textsc{MWIS}) in graphs with a bounded number of pairwise vertex-disjoint and non-adjacent long induced cycles. More formally, for every fixed $s$ and $t$, we show a QPTAS for \textsc{MWIS} in graphs that exclude $sC_t$ as an induced minor. Combining this with known results, we obtain a QPTAS for the problem of finding a largest induced subgraph of bounded treewidth with given hereditary property definable in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic, in the same classes of graphs.
  This is a step towards a conjecture of Gartland and Lokshtanov which asserts that for any planar graph $H$, graphs that exclude $H$ as an induced minor admit a polynomial-time algorithm for the latter problem. This conjecture is notoriously open and even its weaker variants are confirmed only for very restricted graphs $H$.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Clustering with Noisy Distance Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bateni et al. has recently introduced the weak-strong distance oracle model to study clustering problems in settings with limited distance information. Given query access to the strong-oracle and weak-oracle in the weak-strong oracle model, the authors design approximation algorithms for $k$-means and $k$-center clustering problems. In this work, we design algorithms with improved guarantees for $k$-means and $k$-center clustering problems in the weak-strong oracle model. The $k$-means++ algorithm is routinely used to solve $k$-means in settings where complete distance information is available. One of the main contributions of this work is to show that $k$-means++ algorithm can be adapted to work in the weak-strong oracle model using only a small number of strong-oracle queries, which is the critical resource in this model. In particular, our $k$-means++ based algorithm gives a constant approximation for $k$-means and uses $O(k^2 \log^2{n})$ strong-oracle queries. This improves on the algorithm of Bateni et al. that uses $O(k^2 \log^4n \log^2 \log n)$ strong-oracle queries for a constant factor approximation of $k$-means. For the $k$-center problem, we give a simple ball-carving based $6(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses $O(k^3 \log^2{n} \log{\frac{\log{n}}{\epsilon}})$ strong-oracle queries. This is an improvement over the $14(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm of Bateni et al. that uses $O(k^2 \log^4{n} \log^2{\frac{\log{n}}{\epsilon}})$ strong-oracle queries. To show the effectiveness of our algorithms, we perform empirical evaluations on real-world datasets and show that our algorithms significantly outperform the algorithms of Bateni et al.</description>

      <title>Faster Parallel Batch-Dynamic Algorithms for Low Out-Degree Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low out-degree orientation directs each edge of an undirected graph with the goal of minimizing the maximum out-degree of a vertex. In the parallel batch-dynamic setting, one can insert or delete batches of edges, and the goal is to process the entire batch in parallel with work per edge similar to that of a single sequential update and with span (or depth) for the entire batch that is polylogarithmic. In this paper we present faster parallel batch-dynamic algorithms for maintaining a low out-degree orientation of an undirected graph. All results herein achieve polylogarithmic depth, with high probability (whp); the focus of this paper is on minimizing the work, which varies across results.
  Our first result is the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm to maintain an asymptotically optimal orientation with asymptotically optimal expected work bounds, in an amortized sense, improving over the prior best work bounds of Liu et al.~[SPAA~'22] by a logarithmic factor.
  Our second result is a $O(c \log n)$ orientation algorithm with expected worst-case $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ work per edge update, where $c$ is a known upper-bound on the arboricity of the graph. This matches the best-known sequential worst-case $O(c \log n)$ orientation algorithm given by Berglin and Brodal ~[Algorithmica~'18], albeit in expectation.
  Our final result is a $O(c + \log n)$-orientation algorithm with $O(\log^2 n)$ expected worst-case work per edge update. This algorithm significantly improves upon the recent result of Ghaffari and Koo~[SPAA~'25], which maintains a $O(c)$-orientation with $O(\log^9 n)$ worst-case work per edge whp.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Online Resource Allocation: Learning from a Single Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Unifying Formal Explanations: A Complexity-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.</description>

      <title>Generating minimal redundant and maximal irredundant sets in incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proved by Boros and Makino that there is no output-polynomial-time algorithm enumerating the minimal redundant sets or the maximal irredundant sets of a hypergraph, unless P=NP. The same question was left open for graphs, with only a few tractable cases known to date. In this paper, we focus on graph classes that capture incidence relations such as bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs. Concerning maximal irredundant sets, we show that the problem on co-bipartite graphs is as hard as in general graphs and tractable in split and strongly orderable graphs, the latter being a generalization of chordal bipartite graphs. As for minimal redundant sets enumeration, we first show that the problem is intractable in split and co-bipartite graphs, answering the aforementioned open question, and that it is tractable on $(C_3,C_5,C_6,C_8)$-free graphs, a class of graphs incomparable to strongly orderable graphs, and which also generalizes chordal bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism for Tournaments of Small Twin Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that isomorphism of tournaments of twin width at most $k$ can be decided in time $k^{O(\log k)}n^{O(1)}$. This implies that the isomorphism problem for classes of tournaments of bounded or moderately growing twin width is in polynomial time. By comparison, there are classes of undirected graphs of bounded twin width that are isomorphism complete, that is, the isomorphism problem for the classes is as hard as the general graph isomorphism problem. Twin width is a graph parameter that has been introduced only recently (Bonnet et al., J. ACM 2022), but has received a lot of attention in structural graph theory since then. On directed graphs, it is functionally smaller than clique width. We prove that on tournaments (but not on general directed graphs) it is also functionally smaller than directed tree width (and thus, the same also holds for cut width and directed path width). Hence, our result implies that tournament isomorphism testing is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by any of these parameters.
  Our isomorphism algorithm heavily employs group-theoretic techniques. This seems to be necessary: as a second main result, we show that the combinatorial Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm does not decide isomorphism of tournaments of twin width at most 35 if its dimension is $o(n)$. (Throughout this abstract, $n$ is the order of the input graphs.)</description>

      <title>Computing k-mers in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computational problems on $k$-mers (strings of length $k$) in labeled graphs. As a starting point, we consider the problem of counting the number of distinct $k$-mers found on the walks of a graph. We establish that this is $\#$P-hard, even on connected deterministic DAGs. However, in the class of deterministic Wheeler graphs (Gagie, Manzini, and Sir\`en, TCS 2017), we show that distinct $k$-mers of such a graph $W=(V, E)$ can be counted using $O(|W|k)$ or $O(n^4 \log k)$ arithmetic operations, where $n=|V|$, $m=|E|$ and $|W|=n+m$. The latter result uses a new generalization of the technique of prefix doubling to Wheeler graphs. To generalize our results beyond Wheeler graphs, we discuss ways to transform a graph into a Wheeler graph in a manner that preserves the $k$-mers.
  As an application of our $k$-mer counting algorithms, we construct a representation of the de Bruijn graph of the $k$-mers that occupies $O(n_k + |W|k \log(\max_{1 \leq \ell \leq k} n_\ell) + \sigma\log m)$ bits of space, where $n_\ell$ is the number of distinct $\ell$-mers in the Wheeler graph, and $\sigma$ is the size of the alphabet. We show how to construct it in the same time complexity. Given that the Wheeler graph can be exponentially smaller than the de Bruijn graph, for large $k$ this provides a theoretical improvement over previous de Bruijn graph construction methods from graphs, which must spend $\Omega(k)$ time per $k$-mer in the graph.</description>

      <title>Greedy matroid base packings with applications to dynamic graph density and orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greedy minimum weight spanning tree packings have proven to be useful in connectivity-related problems. We study the process of greedy minimum weight base packings in general matroids and explore its applications.
  For general matroids, we observe two characterizations of the limit of the base packings (``the vector of ideal loads''). Specialized to graphic matroids, it implies the characterizations from [Cen, Fleischmann, Li, Li, Panigrahi, FOCS'25], namely, their entropy-minimization theorem and their bottom-up cut hierarchy.
  We give combinatorial results on the greedy tree packings. We show that a tree packing of $O(\lambda^5\log m)$ trees contains a tree crossing some min-cut once, which improves the bound $O(\lambda^7\log^3m)$ from [Thorup, Combinatorica'07]. We also strengthen the lower bound on the edge load convergence rate from [de Vos, Christiansen, SODA'25], showing that Thorup's upper bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor.
  When specialized to bicircular matroids, our results yield an algorithm for the approximate fully-dynamic densest subgraph density $\rho$. We maintain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the density with a worst-case update time $O((\rho_{\max}\varepsilon^{-2}+\varepsilon^{-4})\rho_{\max}\log^3 m)$, where $\rho_{\max}$ is a fixed known upper bound on $\rho$. This complexity is worse than the state-of-the-art dynamic approximate density. However, our algorithm offers a new approach to the problem, which could be appealing due to its simplicity. We also can maintain an implicit fractional out-orientation with a guarantee that all out-degrees are at most $(1+\varepsilon)\rho$.
  Our algorithms above work by greedily packing pseudoforests, and require maintenance of a minimum-weight pseudoforest in a dynamically changing graph. We show that this problem can be solved in $O(\log n)$ worst-case time per edge insertion or deletion.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Optimization using Comparison Oracles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In linear combinatorial optimization, we aim to find $S^* = \arg\min_{S \in \mathcal{F}} \langle w,\mathbf{1}_S \rangle$ for a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ over a ground set $U$ of $n$ elements. Traditionally, $w$ is known or accessible via a value oracle. Motivated by practical applications involving pairwise preferences, we study the weaker and more robust comparison oracle, which for any $S, T \in \mathcal{F}$ reveals only if $w(S) &lt;, =, \text{ or } &gt; w(T)$. We investigate the query complexity and computational efficiency of optimizing in this model.
  We present three main contributions. (1) Query Complexity: We establish that the query complexity over any arbitrary set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ is $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. This demonstrates a fundamental separation between information and computational complexity, as the runtime may still be exponential for NP-hard problems. (2) Algorithmic Frameworks: We develop two general tools. First, a Dual Ellipsoid framework establishes an efficient reduction from optimization to certification. It shows that to optimize efficiently, it suffices to efficiently certify a candidate's optimality using only comparisons. Second, Global Subspace Learning (GSL) sorts all feasible sets using $O(nB \log(nB))$ queries for integer weights bounded by $B$. We efficiently implement GSL for linear matroids, yielding improved query complexities for problems like $k$-SUM, SUBSET-SUM, and $A+B$ sorting. (3) Combinatorial Applications: We give the first polynomial-time, low-query algorithms for classic problems, including minimum cuts, minimum weight spanning trees (and matroid bases), bipartite matching (and matroid intersection), and shortest $s$-$t$ paths.
  Our work provides the first general query complexity bounds and efficient algorithmic results for this fundamental model.</description>

      <title>Online Smoothed Demand Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time before a demand-specific deadline $\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to above constraints) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm for $\texttt{OSDM}$ called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting &amp; aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation \[ \mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}), \] where $\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is locally Lipschitz. For a box $B_0 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $h &gt; 0$, we denote by $\mathrm{IVP}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h)$ the set of solutions $\mathbf{x} : [0,h] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying \[ \mathbf{x}'(t) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t)), \qquad \mathbf{x}(0) \in B_0 . \]
  We present a complete validated algorithm for the following \emph{End Cover Problem}: given $(\mathbf{f}, B_0, \varepsilon, h)$, compute a finite set $\mathcal{C}$ of boxes such that \[ \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \;\subseteq\; \bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{C}} B \;\subseteq\; \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \oplus [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]^n , \] where \[ \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) = \left\{ \mathbf{x}(h) : \mathbf{x} \in \mathrm{IVP}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \right\}. \]
  Moreover, we provide a complexity analysis of our algorithm and introduce a novel technique for computing the end cover $\mathcal{C}$ based on covering the boundary of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h)$. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08098</link>

Abstract: Motivated by optimization oracles in bandits with network interference, we study the Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling (NAGL) problem. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\sum_{v \in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\!\left(n\cdot \mathrm{tw}(G^2)\cdot L^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\right)$ time. For approximation, unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is no polynomial-time $n^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation on general graphs even under the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$; without the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$, no finite multiplicative approximation ratio is possible. In the nonnegative-reward regime, we give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NAGL in two settings: (i) given a proper $q$-coloring of $G^2$, we obtain a $1/q$-approximation; and (ii) on planar graphs of bounded maximum degree, we develop a Baker-type polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which becomes an efficient PTAS (EPTAS) when $L$ is constant.</description>

      <title>Approximately: Independence Implies Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\newcommand{\eps}{\varepsilon}$
  We observe that a $(1-\eps)$-approximation algorithm to Independent Set, that works for any induced subgraph of the input graph, can be used, via a polynomial time reduction, to provide a $(1+\eps)$-approximation to Vertex Cover. This basic observation was made before, see [BHR11].
  As a consequence, we get a PTAS for VC for unweighted pseudo-disks, QQPTAS for VC for unweighted axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, and QPTAS for MWVC for weighted polygons in the plane. To the best of our knowledge all these results are new.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, which are graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. To classify the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for connected $H$, it remains to consider when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided ``H''-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ that is a star, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. We develop new decomposition theorems resulting in polynomial-time algorithms, and in combination with known results, fully classify all cases $\mathbb{H}_0$ and $\mathbb{H}_1$. To illustrate the wider applicability of our techniques, we also employ them to obtain similar new polynomial-time results for two other classic graph problems: Stable Cut and, in part, Feedback Vertex Set.</description>
