      <title>FabuLight-ASD: Unveiling Speech Activity via Body Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility. These findings validate the efficacy of FabuLight-ASD in enhancing ASD performance through the integration of body pose data.

      <title>Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>ComfyGI: Automatic Improvement of Image Generation Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic image generation is no longer just of interest to researchers, but also to practitioners. However, current models are sensitive to the settings used and automatic optimization methods often require human involvement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ComfyGI, a novel approach to automatically improve workflows for image generation without the need for human intervention driven by techniques from genetic improvement. This enables image generation with significantly higher quality in terms of the alignment with the given description and the perceived aesthetics. On the performance side, we find that overall, the images generated with an optimized workflow are about 50% better compared to the initial workflow in terms of the median ImageReward score. These already good results are even surpassed in our human evaluation, as the participants preferred the images improved by ComfyGI in around 90% of the cases.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Working Memory via Moment Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans possess a finely tuned sense of uncertainty that helps anticipate potential errors, vital for adaptive behavior and survival. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study applies moment neural networks (MNNs) to explore the neural mechanism of uncertainty quantification in working memory (WM). The MNN captures nonlinear coupling of the first two moments in spiking neural networks (SNNs), identifying firing covariance as a key indicator of uncertainty in encoded information. Trained on a WM task, the model demonstrates coding precision and uncertainty quantification comparable to human performance. Analysis reveals a link between the probabilistic and sampling-based coding for uncertainty representation. Transferring the MNN's weights to an SNN replicates these results. Furthermore, the study provides testable predictions demonstrating how noise and heterogeneity enhance WM performance, highlighting their beneficial role rather than being mere biological byproducts. These findings offer insights into how the brain effectively manages uncertainty with exceptional accuracy.</description>

      <title>Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Exploiting Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to the energy-efficient and multiplication-free characteristics. Despite these advantages, deploying large-scale SNNs on edge hardware is challenging due to limited resource availability. Network pruning offers a viable approach to compress the network scale and reduce hardware resource requirements for model deployment. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because they lack efficiency in processing the sparse spike representation of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience and the high biological plausibility of SNNs, we explore and leverage criticality to facilitate efficient pruning in deep SNNs. We firstly explain criticality in SNNs from the perspective of maximizing feature information entropy. Second, We propose a low-cost metric for assess neuron criticality in feature transmission and design a pruning-regeneration method that incorporates this criticality into the pruning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26\% reduction of pruning cost. The criticality-based regeneration process efficiently selects potential structures and facilitates consistent feature representation.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</description>

      <title>Ecology, Spatial Structure, and Selection Pressure Induce Strong Signatures in Phylogenetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary dynamics are shaped by a variety of fundamental, generic drivers, including spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure. These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</description>
