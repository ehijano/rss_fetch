      <title>$h$-topology for rigid spaces and an application to $p$-adic Simpson correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $h$-topology for rigid spaces. Along the way, we establish several foundational results on morphisms of rigid spaces: we prove generic flatness and openness of the flat locus in the rigid setting, and we show that (for affinoid rigid spaces) strict transforms become flat after a blowup. Moreover, we show that any fppf cover admits a quasi-finite refinement and prove a version of Zariski's main theorem for rigid spaces. As an application, we deduce that for a proper rigid space $X$ over $C$, the category of pro-\'etale vector bundles on $X$ is equivalent to the category of Higgs bundles on the $h$-site of $X$, thereby generalizing Heuer's results to the singular setting.</description>

      <title>Isoperiodic deformations of Toda curves and chains, the difference Korteweg - de Vries equation, and $SU(N)$ Seiberg-Witten theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the dynamics of Toda curves of order $N$ and derive differential equations governing this dynamics. We apply the obtained results to describe isoperiodic deformations of $N$-periodic Toda chains and periodic difference Korteweg-de Vries equation. We describe deformations of the essential spectra of $N$-periodic two-sided Jacobi matrices. We also study singular regimes of $SU(N)$ Seiberg-Witten theory and describe their deformations preserving the number of singularities where new massless particles may occur. We introduce and describe isoequilibrium deformations of arbitrary collections of $d$ real disjoint closed intervals. We conclude by providing explicit triangular solutions to constrained Schlesinger systems.</description>

      <title>Nearly Gorenstein rational surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for any rational surface singularity $A$, the canonical trace ideal $\mathrm{Tr}_A(K_A)$ is integrally closed ideal which is represented by the minimal anti-nef cycle $F$ on the minimal resolution of singularities so that $K_X+F$ is anti-nef. Then $F \ge \mathbb Z$ if $A$ is not Gorenstein, where $\mathbb Z$ is the fundamental cycle. As a result, we give a criterion for rational surface singularity $A$ to be nearly Gorenstein.
  Moreover, we classify all nearly Gorenstein rational singularities in terms of resolution of singularities in the following cases: (a) the fundamental cycle $\mathbb Z$ is almost reduced; (b) quotient singularity.</description>

      <title>Homology of Local Systems on Real Line Arrangement Complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homology groups of the complement of a complexified real line arrangement with coefficients in complex rank-one local systems. Using Borel--Moore homology, we establish an algorithm computing their dimensions via the real figures of the arrangement. It enables us to give a new upper bound. We further consider the case where the arrangement contains a sharp pair and make partial progress on a conjecture proposed by Yoshinaga.</description>

      <title>Fano compactifications of mutation algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of mutation semigroup algebras. This concept simultaneously generalizes cluster algebras and semigroup algebras. We show that, under some mild conditions on the singularities, the spectrum $U={\rm Spec}(R)$ of a mutation semigroup algebra $R$ admits a log Fano compactification $U\hookrightarrow X$. The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Volumes of foliations birationally bounded by algebraically integrable families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for log canonical foliations which are birationally bounded by algebraically integrable families, the set of their volumes satisfies the DCC. This answers a special case of a question posed by Cascini, Hacon, and Langer. As a key ingredient, we establish the deformation invariance of relative log canonical volumes for a family of weak semistable morphisms, which can be viewed as a relative version of the classical result proved by Hacon, McKernan, and Xu.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, going back to Darboux in 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.</description>

      <title>The algebro-geometric aspect of the iterated limit of a quaternary of means of four terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the iterated limit of a quaternary of means of four terms through the period map from the family of cyclic fourfold coverings of the complex projective line branching at six points to the three-dimensional complex ball $\mathbb{B}_3$ embedded into the Siegel upper half-space of degree four. We construct four automorphic forms on $\mathbb{B}_3$ expressing the inverse of the period map, and give an equality between one of them and a period integral, which is an analogy of Jacobi's formula between a theta constant and an elliptic integral. We find a transformation of $\mathbb{B}_3$ such that the quaternary of means appears by its actions on the four automorphic forms. These results enable us to express the iterated limit by the Lauricella hypergeometric series of type $D$ in three variables.</description>

      <title>Factoriality and birational rigidity of two families of singular quartic three-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study two families of three-dimensional quartics in the complex projective space ${\mathbb P}^4$: hypersurfaces with a unique quadratic singularity of rank 3, which is resolved by two blowups, and hypersurfaces with two quadratic singularities of rank 3 and 4, respectively. Both families have codimension 3 in the natural parameter space. For a Zariski general quartic in each of these families we prove factoriality and birational rigidity and describe its group of birational self-maps.</description>

      <title>Non-finite generatedness of the congruences defined by tropical varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In tropical geometry, there are several important classes of ideals and congruences such as tropical ideals, bend congruences, and the congruences of the form $\mathbf E(Z)$. Although they are analogues of the concept of ideals of rings, it is not well known whether they are finitely generated. In this paper, we study whether the congruences of the form $\mathbf E(Z)$ are finitely generated. In particular, we show that when $Z$ is the support of a tropical variety, $\mathbf E(Z)$ is not finitely generated except for a few specific cases. In addition, we give an explicit minimal generating set of $\mathbf E(|L|)$ for the tropical standard line $L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers studying both the geometric structure of Fano fibrations and the application to K\"ahler-Ricci flows developing a singularity in finite time. Given a Fano fibration which is generated by Kawamata's theorem from a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ endowed with an ample, rational line bundle $L$ and non-nef canonical line bundle $K_X$, we construct a $(1,1)$-form on the regular part of the base analytic variety which is related to the Weil-Petersson metric. It is also proven that the singular K\"ahler metric constructed by Zhang, Zhang, on the base analytic variety satisfies a twisted K\"ahler-Einstein equation involving this $(1,1)$-form and, for a submersion, that the Chern classes of $X$ and the base manifold decompose in terms of this $(1,1)$-form.</description>

Abstract: Cyclic coverings produce many examples of topologically contractible smooth affine complex varieties. In this paper, we study the motivic cohomology groups of cyclic coverings over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$. In particular, we prove that in many situations Chow groups of cyclic coverings become trivial after tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, we can prove that the Chow groups of certain bicyclic coverings are trivial even without tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Effective faithful tropicalizations and embeddings for abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ that is complete with respect to a nontrivial nonarchimedean absolute value. Let $A^{\mathrm{an}}$ denote the analytification of $A$ in the sense of Berkovich, and let $\Sigma$ be the canonical skeleton of $A^{\mathrm{an}}$. In this paper, we obtain a faithful tropicalization of $\Sigma$ by nonarchimedean theta functions, giving a tropical version of the classical theorem of Lefschetz on abelian varieties. Key ingredients of the proof are (1) faithful embeddings of tropical abelian varieties by tropical theta functions and (2) lifting of tropical theta functions to nonarchimedean theta functions, and they will be of independent interest. For (1), we use some arguments similar to the case of complex abelian varieties as well as Voronoi cells of lattices. For (2), we use Fourier expansions of nonarchimedean theta functions over the Raynaud extensions of abelian varieties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe Mixed-Spin-P(MSP) fields for a smooth CY 3-fold $X_{3,3} \subset \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2$. Then we describe $\mathbb{C}^* -$fixed loci of the moduli space of these MSP fields. We prove that any virtual localization term coming from the fixed locus corresponding to an irregular graph does not contribute to the invariant if the graph is not a pure loop, and also prove this vanishing property for the moduli space of N-MSP fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any two definable germs in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure, there exists a critical threshold $\alpha_0 \in (0,1)$ such that if these germs are bi-$\alpha$-H"older equivalent for some $\alpha \ge \alpha_0$, then they satisfy the following: \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$] \item The Lipschitz normal embedding (LNE) property is preserved; that is, if one germ is LNE then so is the other; \item Their tangent cones have the same dimension; \item The links of their tangent cones have isomorphic homotopy groups. \end{itemize} As an application, we give an simple proof that a complex analytic germ which is bi-$\alpha$-H"older homeomorphic to the germ of a Euclidean space for some $\alpha$ sufficiently close to $1$ must be smooth. This provides a slightly stronger version of Sampaio's smoothness theorem, in which the germs are assumed to be bi-$\alpha$-H"older homeomorphic for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be the quintic del Pezzo $4$-fold. It is very well-known that $X$ is realized by a smooth linear section of Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,5)$. In this paper, we prove that the Hilbert scheme of conics in $X$ is a smooth variety of dimension $7$ by using a torus action on $X$, which provides a more direct proof about the first named author's previous result.</description>

      <title>Microlocal indices and Chern Classes of Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how global index formulas arise in the theory of one-dimensional holomorphic foliation from the microlocal point of view. We give short proofs and generalizations to a few exisiting index formulas concerning Schwartz, GSV and logarithmic indices.</description>

      <title>Singularities of base loci on abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the log canonical threshold of the base ideal of a complete linear system on a complex abelian variety is $\ge 1$, and equality holds if and only if the base locus has divisorial components. Consequently the same assertions hold for the ideal of the intersection of translates of theta divisors by the points of a finite subgroup.</description>

      <title>Cuspidal character sheaves on graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show in this paper that in the context of graded Lie algebras, all cuspidal character sheaves arise from a nearby-cycle construction followed by a Fourier--Sato transform in a very specific manner. Combined with results of the last two named authors, this completes the classification of cuspidal character sheaves for Vinberg's type I graded classical Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Skein and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$. We show its global section $\Gamma(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, thereby providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(\Sigma)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Newton polygons, a key factorization result for polynomials over discrete valuation domains is proved, which in particular yields new irreducibility criteria including a generalization of the classical irreducibility criterion of Dumas.</description>

      <title>On some indices of foliations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a relationship between the Milnor number, the $\chi$-number, and the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to an effective balanced divisor of separatrices. Moreover, using the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, we prove that the difference between the multiplicity and the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to a reduced curve is independent of the foliation. We also derive a local formula for the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to a reduced curve. From a global point of view, these results lead to the following consequences: we provide a new proof of a global result regarding the multiplicity of a foliation due to Cerveau-Lins Neto and a new proof of a Soares's inequality for the sum of the Milnor number of an invariant curve of a foliation. Additionally, we obtain bounds for the global Tjurina number of a foliation on the complex projective plane. Finally, we provide an answer to the conjecture posed by Alc\'antara and Mozo-Fern\'andez about foliations on the complex projective plane having a unique singularity.</description>
