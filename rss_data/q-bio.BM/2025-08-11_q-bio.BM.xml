      <title>Designing de novo TIM Barrels: Insights into Stabilization, Diversification, and Functionalization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TIM-barrel fold is one of the most versatile and ubiquitous protein folds in nature, hosting a wide variety of catalytic activities and functions while serving as a model system in protein biochemistry and engineering. This review explores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in addressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss historical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark creation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a special focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate the sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we examine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards functionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like active site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating structural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based strategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite significant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has been proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating functionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise functionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that simultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both physical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental insights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme design and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein biochemistry, biophysics, and design.</description>

      <title>ActivityDiff: A diffusion model with Positive and Negative Activity Guidance for De Novo Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.</description>
