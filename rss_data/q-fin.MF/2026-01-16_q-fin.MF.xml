      <title>A continuous-time Kyle model with price-responsive traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Kyle-type models of informed trading typically treat noise trader demand as purely exogenous. In reality, many market participants react to price movements and news, generating feedback effects that can significantly alter market dynamics. This paper develops a continuous-time Kyle framework in which two types of price-responsive traders (momentum and contrarian traders) adjust their demand in response to price signals. This extension yields a finite-dimensional Kalman filter for price discovery and leads to a forward-backward Riccati system characterizing equilibrium. We show that when feedback is weak, equilibrium exists and is unique as a smooth perturbation of the classical Kyle solution, allowing us to derive explicit comparative statics for insider profits and price informativeness. For stronger feedback, the model generates rich dynamics, including potential multiplicity of equilibria and amplification effects. Our framework thus bridges the gap between purely exogenous noise and more realistic, behaviorally motivated trading.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures as a structural property of markov kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify indecomposability as a key measure-theoretic underlying uniqueness of invariant probability measures for discrete-time Markov kernels on general state spaces. The argument relies on the mutual singularity of distinct invariant ergodic measures and on the observation that uniqueness follows whenever all invariant probability measures are forced to charge a common reference measure.
  Once existence of invariant probability measures is known, indecomposability alone is sufficient to rule out multiplicity. On standard Borel spaces, this viewpoint is consistent with the classical theory: irreducibility appears as a convenient sufficient condition ensuring indecomposability, rather than as a structural requirement for uniqueness.
  The resulting proofs are purely measure-theoretic and do not rely on recurrence, regeneration, return-time estimates, or regularity assumptions on the transition kernel.</description>
