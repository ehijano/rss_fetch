      <title>A century of the Bose-Einstein condensation concept and half a century of the JINR experiments for observation of condensate in the superfluid 4He (He II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short review is devoted to celebration of two major events in quantum physics. The first one is the birth of the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation (1925) and the second is the experimental proof that it does exist and appears in the liquid 4He simultaneously with superfluidity below the $\lambda$-point (1975). The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Comment on Galina Weinstein's article entitled 'Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincar\'e and Special Relativity' "</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic response to the criticisms raised by Jean-Marc Ginoux in response to my review of his book on the history of relativity. Whereas my review was written in a strictly academic manner, Ginoux's commentary intermingles mathematical objections with ad hominem insinuations about both Einstein and me. The purpose of this reply is twofold: first, to clarify the historiographical and conceptual issues at stake in the interpretation of Einstein's 1905 paper and Poincar\'e's contributions of 1905--1906; and second, to demonstrate why the conflation of algebraic form with conceptual content leads to distorted conclusions.</description>

      <title>Two Wrongs Make One Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An influential argument for scientific realism posits that, if scientific theories were not true, their empirical success would be a coincidence. Here, I show that the false Drude's theory succeeds in explaining the Wiedemann-Franz law by coincidence--a fortuitous compensation of errors.</description>

      <title>Der Stern von Bethlehem -- Einige Theorien und Hintergruende: Von der altorientalischen Astrologie ueber Kepler zu Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding "geocentric" and "heliocentric" world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.</description>

      <title>About testing Bell locality at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, in the presence of strong and electroweak interactions, with systems that consist of qubits (fermions) and qutrits (massive spin-1 bosons). Quantum state tomography at colliders enables the witnessing of entanglement and Bell non-locality, two defining characteristics of quantum mechanics. We offer a comprehensive explanation of the underlying principles and the methods employed to achieve this remarkable feat.</description>
