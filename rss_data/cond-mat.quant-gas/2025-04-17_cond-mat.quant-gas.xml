      <title>Coarsening of binary Bose superfluids: an effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation of motion for binary Bose mixtures, which generalizes the Cahn-Hilliard description of classical binary fluids to superfluid systems. Within this approach, based on a microscopic Hamiltonian formulation, we show that the domain growth law $L(t)\sim t^{2/3}$ observed in superfluid mixtures is not driven by hydrodynamic flows, but arises from the competition between interactions and quantum pressure. The effective theory allows us to derive key properties of superfluid coarsening, including domain growth and Porod's laws. This provides a new theoretical framework for understanding phase separation in superfluid mixtures.</description>

      <title>Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Quantum-gas microscopy of the Bose-glass phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible quantity.In general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.</description>

      <title>Reentrant phase transition in quasiperiodic photonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson transition in quasiperiodic potentials and the associated mobility edges have been a central focus in quantum simulation across multidisciplinary physical platforms. While these transitions have been experimentally observed in ultracold atoms, acoustic systems, optical waveguides, and superconducting junctions, their interplay between quasiperiodic potential and long-range hopping remains unexplored experimentally. In this work, we report the observation of localization-delocalization transition induced by the hopping between the next-nearest neighboring sites using quasiperiodic photonic waveguides. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the next-nearest hopping strength induces a reentrant phase transition, where the system transitions from an initially extended phase into a localized phase before eventually returning to an extended phase. This remarkable interplay between hopping and quasiperiodic potential in the lattice models provides crucial insights into the mechanism of Anderson transition. Furthermore, our numerical simulation reveals that this phase transition exhibits a critical exponent of $\nu \simeq 1/3$, which is experimentally observable for system sizes $L\sim10^3$ - $10^4$. These results establish a framework for direct observation of the Anderson transition and precise determination of its critical exponents, which can significantly advance our understanding of localization physics in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Global becomes local: Efficient many-body dynamics for global master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work makes progress on the issue of global vs. local master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born and Markov approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <title>Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.</description>
