      <title>Online Partitioned Local Depth for semi-supervised applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the partitioned local depth (PaLD) algorithm that is adapted to online applications such as semi-supervised prediction. The new algorithm we present, online PaLD, is well-suited to situations where it is a possible to pre-compute a cohesion network from a reference dataset. After $O(n^3)$ steps to construct a queryable data structure, online PaLD can extend the cohesion network to a new data point in $O(n^2)$ time. Our approach complements previous speed up approaches based on approximation and parallelism. For illustrations, we present applications to online anomaly detection and semi-supervised classification for health-care datasets.</description>

      <title>A Teacher-Student Perspective on the Dynamics of Learning Near the Optimal Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Partial Least Squares: Spectral Analysis and Fundamental Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian latent class reinforcement learning framework to capture adaptive, feedback-driven travel behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.</description>

      <title>Model inference for ranking from pairwise comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking objects from noisy pairwise comparisons, for example, ranking tennis players from the outcomes of matches. We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications. We include several case studies to exemplify the method on real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Multivariate Conformal Prediction with Fast Transductive Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conformal prediction method for constructing tight simultaneous prediction intervals for multiple, potentially related, numerical outputs given a single input. This method can be combined with any multi-target regression model and guarantees finite-sample coverage. It is computationally efficient and yields informative prediction intervals even with limited data. The core idea is a novel \emph{coordinate-wise} standardization procedure that makes residuals across output dimensions directly comparable, estimating suitable scaling parameters using the calibration data themselves. This does not require modeling of cross-output dependence nor auxiliary sample splitting. Implementing this idea requires overcoming technical challenges associated with transductive or full conformal prediction. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate this method can produce tighter prediction intervals than existing baselines while maintaining valid simultaneous coverage.</description>

      <title>Soft Geometric Inductive Bias for Object Centric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Language Models are Secretly Energy-Based Models: Insights into the Lookahead Capabilities of Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.</description>

      <title>Fully Bayesian Spectral Clustering and Benchmarking with Uncertainty Quantification for Small Area Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, inspired by machine learning techniques, we propose a new Bayesian model for Small Area Estimation (SAE), the Fay-Herriot model with Spectral Clustering (FH-SC). Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia. Finally, we also illustrate the advantages of FH-SC over existing Bayesian and frequentist approaches through our case study.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Spatial Boundary Estimation and Change Detection: Application to the Sahel Sahara Climate Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial boundaries, such as ecological transitions or climatic regime interfaces, capture steep environmental gradients, and shifts in their structure can signal emerging environmental changes. Quantifying uncertainty in spatial boundary locations and formally testing for temporal shifts remains challenging, especially when boundaries are derived from noisy, gridded environmental data. We present a unified framework that combines heteroskedastic Gaussian process (GP) regression with a scaled Maximum Absolute Difference (MAD) Global Envelope Test (GET) to estimate spatial boundary curves and assess whether they evolve over time. The heteroskedastic GP provides a flexible probabilistic reconstruction of boundary lines, capturing spatially varying mean structure and location specific variability, while the test offers a rigorous hypothesis testing tool for detecting departures from expected boundary behaviors. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves the correct size under the null and high power for detecting local boundary shifts. Applying our framework to the Sahel Sahara transition zone, using annual Koppen Trewartha climate classifications from 1960 to 1989, we find no statistically significant decade scale changes in the arid and semi arid or semi arid and non arid interfaces. However, the method successfully identifies localized boundary shifts during the extreme drought years of 1983 and 1984, consistent with climate studies documenting regional anomalies in these interfaces during that period.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum advantage in machine learning from the representability of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.</description>

      <title>Robust Tensor Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery via Deterministic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor, also known as multi-dimensional array, arises from many applications in signal processing, manufacturing processes, healthcare, among others. As one of the most popular methods in tensor literature, Robust tensor principal component analysis (RTPCA) is a very effective tool to extract the low rank and sparse components in tensors. In this paper, a new method to analyze RTPCA is proposed based on the recently developed tensor-tensor product and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, it aims to solve a convex optimization problem whose objective function is a weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm. In most of literature of RTPCA, the exact recovery is built on the tensor incoherence conditions and the assumption of a uniform model on the sparse support. Unlike this conventional way, in this paper, without any assumption of randomness, the exact recovery can be achieved in a completely deterministic fashion by characterizing the tensor rank-sparsity incoherence, which is an uncertainty principle between the low-rank tensor spaces and the pattern of sparse tensor.</description>

      <title>Natural Variational Annealing for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new multimodal optimization approach called Natural Variational Annealing (NVA) that combines the strengths of three foundational concepts to simultaneously search for multiple global and local modes of black-box nonconvex objectives. First, it implements a simultaneous search by using variational posteriors, such as, mixtures of Gaussians. Second, it applies annealing to gradually trade off exploration for exploitation. Finally, it learns the variational search distribution using natural-gradient learning where updates resemble well-known and easy-to-implement algorithms. The three concepts come together in NVA giving rise to new algorithms and also allowing us to incorporate "fitness shaping", a core concept from evolutionary algorithms. We assess the quality of search on simulations and compare them to methods using gradient descent and evolution strategies. We also provide an application to a real-world inverse problem in planetary science.</description>

      <title>All Models Are Miscalibrated, But Some Less So: Comparing Calibration with Conditional Mean Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When working in a high-risk setting, having well calibrated probabilistic predictive models is a crucial requirement. However, estimators for calibration error are not always able to correctly distinguish which model is better calibrated. We propose the \emph{conditional kernel calibration error} (CKCE) which is based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the difference between conditional mean operators. By working directly with the definition of strong calibration as the distance between conditional distributions, which we represent by their embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, the CKCE is less sensitive to the marginal distribution of predictive models. This makes it more effective for relative comparisons than previously proposed calibration metrics. Our experiments, using both synthetic and real data, show that CKCE provides a more consistent ranking of models by their calibration error and is more robust against distribution shift.</description>

Abstract: In many operational settings, decision-makers must commit to actions before uncertainty resolves, but existing optimization tools rarely quantify how consistently a chosen decision remains optimal across plausible scenarios. This paper introduces CREDO -- Conformalized Risk Estimation for Decision Optimization, a distribution-free framework that quantifies the probability that a prescribed decision remains (near-)optimal across realizations of uncertainty. CREDO reformulates decision risk through the inverse feasible region -- the set of outcomes under which a decision is optimal -- and estimates its probability using inner approximations constructed from conformal prediction balls generated by a conditional generative model. This approach yields finite-sample, distribution-free lower bounds on the probability of decision optimality. The framework is model-agnostic and broadly applicable across a wide range of optimization problems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that CREDO provides accurate, efficient, and reliable evaluations of decision optimality across various optimization settings.</description>

      <title>Geopolitics, Geoeconomics and Risk: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42 countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially, their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity, as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Multimodal Medical Imaging: A Theoretical Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical imaging often operates under limited labeled data, especially in rare disease and low resource clinical environments. Existing multimodal and meta learning approaches improve performance in these settings but lack a theoretical explanation of why or when they succeed. This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for few shot multimodal medical imaging that jointly characterizes sample complexity, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Using PAC learning, VC theory, and PAC Bayesian analysis, we derive bounds that describe the minimum number of labeled samples required for reliable performance and show how complementary modalities reduce effective capacity through an information gain term. We further introduce a formal metric for explanation stability, proving that explanation variance decreases at an inverse n rate. A sequential Bayesian interpretation of Chain of Thought reasoning is also developed to show stepwise posterior contraction. To illustrate these ideas, we implement a controlled multimodal dataset and evaluate an additive CNN MLP fusion model under few shot regimes, confirming predicted multimodal gains, modality interference at larger sample sizes, and shrinking predictive uncertainty. Together, the framework provides a principled foundation for designing data efficient, uncertainty aware, and interpretable diagnostic models in low resource settings.</description>

      <title>SketchOGD: Memory-Efficient Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When machine learning models are trained continually on a sequence of tasks, they are often liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks--a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.</description>

      <title>Variational Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task investigates effective domain adaptation under the scenario of continuous domain shifts during testing time. Due to the utilization of solely unlabeled samples, there exists significant uncertainty in model updates, leading CTTA to encounter severe error accumulation issues. In this paper, we introduce VCoTTA, a variational Bayesian approach to measure uncertainties in CTTA. At the source stage, we transform a pretrained deterministic model into a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) via a variational warm-up strategy, injecting uncertainties into the model. During the testing time, we employ a mean-teacher update strategy using variational inference for the student model and exponential moving average for the teacher model. Our novel approach updates the student model by combining priors from both the source and teacher models. The evidence lower bound is formulated as the cross-entropy between the student and teacher models, along with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the prior mixture. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in mitigating error accumulation within the CTTA framework.</description>

      <title>Imbalances in Neurosymbolic Learning: Characterization and Mitigating Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the most popular problems in **neurosymbolic learning** (NSL), that of learning neural classifiers given only the result of applying a symbolic component $\sigma$ to the gold labels of the elements of a vector $\mathbf x$. The gold labels of the elements in $\mathbf x$ are unknown to the learner. We make multiple contributions, theoretical and practical, to address a problem that has not been studied so far in this context, that of characterizing and mitigating *learning imbalances*, i.e., major differences in the errors that occur when classifying instances of different classes (aka **class-specific risks**). Our theoretical analysis reveals a unique phenomenon: that $\sigma$ can greatly impact learning imbalances. This result sharply contrasts with previous research on supervised and weakly supervised learning, which only studies learning imbalances under data imbalances. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden gold labels using weakly supervised data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training and testing time by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques using strong baselines from NSL and long-tailed learning, suggesting performance improvements of up to 14%.</description>

      <title>Scalable Temporal Anomaly Causality Discovery in Large Systems: Achieving Computational Efficiency with Binary Anomaly Flag Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting anomaly causality facilitates diagnostics once monitoring systems detect system faults. Identifying anomaly causes in large systems involves investigating a broader set of monitoring variables across multiple subsystems. However, learning graphical causal models (GCMs) comes with a significant computational burden that restrains the applicability of most existing methods in real-time and large-scale deployments. In addition, modern monitoring applications for large systems often generate large amounts of binary alarm flags, and the distinct characteristics of binary anomaly data -- the meaning of state transition and data sparsity -- challenge existing causality learning mechanisms. This study proposes an anomaly causal discovery approach (\textsc{AnomalyCD}), addressing the accuracy and computational challenges of generating GCMs from temporal binary flag datasets. The \textsc{AnomalyCD} presents several strategies, such as anomaly data-aware causality testing, sparse data and prior link compression, and edge pruning adjustment approaches. We validate the performance of of the approach on two datasets: monitoring sensor data of the readout-box system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN, and a public data set for information technology monitoring. The results on temporal GCMs demonstrate a considerable reduction of computation overhead and a moderate enhancement of accuracy on the binary anomaly data sets.

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the permutation importance measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Forests have become a widely used tool in machine learning since their introduction in 2001, known for their strong performance in classification and regression tasks. One key feature of Random Forests is the Random Forest Permutation Importance Measure (RFPIM), an internal, non-parametric measure of variable importance. While widely used, theoretical work on RFPIM is sparse, and most research has focused on empirical findings. However, recent progress has been made, such as establishing consistency of the RFPIM, although a mathematical analysis of its asymptotic distribution is still missing. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of a Central Limit Theorem for RFPIM using U-Statistics theory. Our approach deviates from the conventional Random Forest model by assuming a random number of trees and imposing conditions on the regression functions and error terms, which must be bounded and additive, respectively. Our result aims at improving the theoretical understanding of RFPIM rather than conducting comprehensive hypothesis testing. However, our contributions provide a solid foundation and demonstrate the potential for future work to extend to practical applications which we also highlight with a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Optimization via Focalized Sparse Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective technique for black-box optimization, but its applicability is typically limited to low-dimensional and small-budget problems due to the cubic complexity of computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. While various approximate GP models have been employed to scale Bayesian optimization to larger sample sizes, most suffer from overly-smooth estimation and focus primarily on problems that allow for large online samples. In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that FocalBO can efficiently leverage large amounts of offline and online data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on robot morphology design and to control a 585-dimensional musculoskeletal system.</description>

      <title>Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the bias of the weighted least-squares solution and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We show that these quantities can be rigorously controlled by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations, yielding the regularized algorithm ReBlocK. Numerical experiments including examples arising from natural gradient optimization demonstrate that ReBlocK can outperform both RBK and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for inconsistent problems with rapidly decaying singular values.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Optimization over Generative Priors via Coarse Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In zeroth-order optimization, we seek to minimize a function $d(\cdot)$, which may encode combinatorial feasibility, using only function evaluations. We focus on the setting where solutions must also satisfy qualitative constraints or conform to a complex prior distribution. To address this, we introduce a new framework in which such constraints are represented by an initial generative prior $\L(\cdot)$, for example, a Large Language Model (LLM). The objective is to find solutions $s$ that minimize $d(s)$ while having high probability under $\L(s)$, effectively sampling from a target distribution proportional to $\L(s) \cdot e^{-T \cdot d(s)}$ for a temperature parameter $T$.
  While this framework aligns with classical Model-Based Optimization (e.g., the Cross-Entropy method), existing theory is ill-suited for deriving sample complexity bounds in black-box deep generative models. We therefore propose a novel learning assumption, which we term \emph{coarse learnability}, where an agent with access to a polynomial number of samples can learn a model whose point-wise density approximates the target within a polynomial factor. Leveraging this assumption, we design an iterative algorithm that employs a Metropolis-Hastings correction to provably approximate the target distribution using a polynomial number of samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to establish such sample-complexity guarantees for model-based optimization with deep generative priors.
  We provide two lines of evidence supporting the coarse learnability assumption. Theoretically, we show that maximum likelihood estimation naturally induces the required coverage properties, holding for both standard exponential families and for misspecified models. Empirically, we demonstrate that LLMs can adapt their learned distributions to zeroth-order feedback to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption, we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Linear Discriminant Analysis for High Dimensional Matrix-Valued Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses classification problems with matrix-valued data, which commonly arise in applications such as neuroimaging and signal processing. Building on the assumption that the data from each class follows a matrix normal distribution, we propose a novel extension of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) tailored for matrix-valued observations. To effectively capture structural information while maintaining estimation flexibility, we adopt a nonparametric empirical Bayes framework based on Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE), applied to vectorized and scaled matrices. The NPMLE method has been shown to provide robust, flexible, and accurate estimates for vector-valued data with various structures in the mean vector or covariance matrix. By leveraging its strengths, our method is effectively generalized to the matrix setting, thereby improving classification performance. Through extensive simulation studies and real data applications, including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed method tends to outperform existing approaches across a variety of data structures.</description>

      <title>How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Data-intrinsic approximation in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis and processing of data is a vital part of our modern society and requires vast amounts of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Amortized Active Generation of Pareto Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method to equip data-driven polynomial chaos expansion surrogate models with intervals that quantify the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate. To that end, jackknife-based conformal prediction is integrated into regression-based polynomial chaos expansions. The jackknife algorithm uses leave-one-out residuals to generate predictive intervals around the predictions of the polynomial chaos surrogate. The jackknife+ extension additionally requires leave-one-out model predictions. Both methods allow to use the entire dataset for model training and do not require a hold-out dataset for prediction interval calibration. The key to efficient implementation is to leverage the linearity of the polynomial chaos regression model, so that leave-one-out residuals and, if necessary, leave-one-out model predictions can be computed with analytical, closed-form expressions. This eliminates the need for repeated model re-training. The conformalized polynomial chaos expansion method is first validated on four benchmark models and then applied to two electrical engineering design use-cases. The method produces predictive intervals that provide the target coverages, even for low-accuracy models trained with small datasets. At the same time, training data availability plays a crucial role in improving the empirical coverage and narrowing the predictive interval, as well as in reducing their variability over different training datasets.</description>

      <title>Flow matching Operators for Residual-Augmented Probabilistic Learning of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning probabilistic surrogates for partial differential equations remains challenging in data-scarce regimes: neural operators require large amounts of high-fidelity data, while generative approaches typically sacrifice resolution invariance. We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium. We show that the proposed method can accurately learn solution operators across different resolutions and fidelities and produces uncertainty estimates that appropriately reflect model confidence, even when trained on limited high-fidelity data.</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Stochastic Gradient Descent via Anytime-Valid Confidence Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex optimization from the perspective of anytime-valid confidence sequences. Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-\alpha$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities.</description>
