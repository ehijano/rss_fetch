      <title>On the comparison of models and experiments in the study of DNA open states: the problem of degrees of freedom</title>

Abstract: Simple mechanical models of DNA play an important role in studying the dynamics of its open states. The main requirement when developing a DNA model is the correct selection of its effective potentials and parameters based on experimental data. At the same time, various experiments allow us to "see" different types of DNA open states. Consideration of this feature is one of the most important conditions in the development, optimization, and parameterization of any mechanical model. Violation of this condition, i.e., the comparison of incomparable characteristics, leads to critical errors. The present investigation is devoted to the problem of degrees of freedom of DNA bases taken into account in mechanical models. Using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model as an example, two types of errors in interpreting experimental data when compared with the model are examined. The first one is a mismatch between the open state types in the model and experiment. The second one is an incorrect specification of the "threshold coordinate" of the open state. The concept of the effective total threshold coordinate of the radial separation of DNA strands for registration of opening is introduced. It is shown that correct interpretation of experimental data can actually eliminate discrepancies with theory.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic state encodes locus-specific chromatin mechanics</title>

Abstract: Chromatin is repeatedly deformed in vivo during transcription, nuclear remodeling, and confined migration - yet how mechanical response varies from locus to locus, and how it relates to epigenetic state, remains unclear. We develop a theory to infer locus-specific viscoelasticity from three-dimensional genome organization. Using chromatin structures derived from contact maps, we calculate frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli for individual loci and establish that the mechanical properties are determined both by chromatin epigenetic marks and organization. On large length scales, chromatin exhibits Rouse-like viscoelastic scaling, but this coarse behavior masks extensive heterogeneity at the single-locus level. Loci segregate into two mechanical subpopulations with distinct longest relaxation times: one characterized by single-timescale and another by multi-timescale relaxation. The multi-timescale loci are strongly enriched in active marks, and the longest relaxation time for individual loci correlates inversely with effective local stiffness. Pull-release simulations further predict a time-dependent susceptibility: H3K27ac-rich loci deform more under sustained forcing yet can resist brief, large impulses. At finer genomic scales, promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies emerge as "viscoelastic islands" aligned with their focal interactions. Together, these results suggest that chromatin viscoelasticity is an organized, epigenetically coupled property of the 3D genome, providing a mechanistic layer that may influence enhancer-promoter communication, condensate-mediated organization, and response to cellular mechanical stress. The prediction that locus-specific mechanics in chromatin are controlled by 3D structures as well as the epigenetic states is amenable to experimental test.</description>

      <title>QSAR-Guided Generative Framework for the Discovery of Synthetically Viable Odorants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fr\'echet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ....</description>

      <title>HELM-BERT: A Transformer for Medium-sized Peptide Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23175</link>

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have emerged as a pivotal modality in modern drug discovery, occupying a chemically and topologically rich space. While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.</description>
