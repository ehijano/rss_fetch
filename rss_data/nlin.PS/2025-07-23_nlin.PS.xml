      <title>Intrinsic localized modes for DNLS equation with competing nonlinearities: bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear excitations described by DNLS-type equations with so-called competing nonlinearities. These are the nonlinearities that consist of two power terms with coefficients of different sign. A key feature of these models is the presence of two governing parameters: $\alpha$, which characterizes the coupling between lattice sites, and $\gamma$, which quantifies the balance between competing nonlinearities. Our study focuses on intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) -- solutions that exhibit spatial localization over a few lattice sites. The basic example for our study is the cubic-quartic equation that recently has been used to describe 3D BEC cloud in the mean field approximation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. We employ numerical continuation from the anti-continuum limit (ACL) where the coupling between the lattice sites is neglected (the case $\alpha=0$). We analyze $\alpha$-dependent branches of the basic ILMs and their bifurcations when $\gamma$ varies. Our study shows that all branches of ILMs originated at anti-continuum limit, except a finite number, bifurcate and do not exist for large values of $\alpha$. We present tables of bifurcations for the ILMs that involve not more than 3 excited lattice sites. It is shown that the model supports nonsymmetric ILMs that have no counterparts in ACL. Also we study the branches of ILMs that can be continued unlimitedly when $\alpha\to \infty$ (called here $\infty$-branches). It was found that for any $\gamma$ there are exactly two (up to symmetries) $\infty$-branches. When $\gamma$ grows these branches undergo a sequence of bifurcations. Finally, we compare our results with the results for the quadratic-cubic equation and the cubic-quintic equation and found no qualitative difference in (a) tables of bifurcations, (b) presence of solutions without ACL counterpart and (c) scenario of switching of $\infty$-branches.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in continuous waves, dark solitons, and vortices in linearly coupled bimodal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model governing the copropagation of two components which represent circular polarizations of light in the optical fiber with relative strength g = 2 of the nonlinear repulsion between the components, and linear coupling between them. A more general system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations, with g =/= 2 and the linear mixing between the components, is considered too. The latter system is introduced in its one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) forms. A new finding is the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of bimodal CW (continuous-wave) states in the case of g &gt; 1 (in the absence of the linear coupling, it corresponds to the immiscibility of the nonlinearly interacting components). The SSB is represented by an exact asymmetric CW solution. An exact solution is also found, in the case of g = 3, for stable dark solitons (DSs) supported by the asymmetric CW background. For g =/= 3, numerical solutions are produced for stable DSs supported by the same background. Moreover, we identify a parameter domain where the fully miscible (symmetric) CW background maintains stable DSs with the inner SSB (separation between the components) in its core. In 2D, the GP system produces stable vortex states with a shift between the components and broken isotropy. The vortices include ones with the inter-component shift imposed by the asymmetric CW background, and states supported by the symmetric background, in which the intrinsic shift (splitting) is exhibited by vortical cores of the two components.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal organization of chemical oscillators via phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study chemical oscillators in the presence of phase separation. By imposing timescale separation between slow reactions and fast diffusion, we define a dynamics at phase equilibrium for the relevant degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that phase separation affects reaction kinetics by localizing reactants within phases, allowing for control of oscillator frequency and amplitude. The analysis is validated with a spatial model. Finally, relaxing the timescale separation between reactions and diffusion leads to waves of phase equilibria at mesoscopic scales.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic snaking of contact defects in reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply spatial dynamical-systems techniques to prove that certain spatiotemporal patterns in reversible reaction-diffusion equations undergo snaking bifurcations. That is, in a narrow region of parameter space, countably many branches of patterned states coexist that connect at towers of saddle-node bifurcations. Our patterns of interest are contact defects, which are 1-dimensional time-periodic patterns with a spatially oscillating core region that at large distances from the origin in space resemble pure temporally oscillatory states and arise as natural analogues of spiral and target waves in one spatial dimension. We show that these solutions lie on snaking branches that have a more complex structure than has been seen in other contexts. In particular, we predict the existence of families of asymmetric travelling defect solutions with arbitrary background phase offsets, in addition to symmetric standing target and spiral patterns. We prove the presence of these additional patterns by reconciling results in classic ODE studies with results from the spatial-dynamics study of patterns in PDEs and using geometrical information contained in the stable and unstable manifolds of the background wavetrains and their natural equivariance structure.</description>

      <title>Self-Accelerating Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge states emerging at the boundaries of materials with nontrivial topology are attractive for many practical applications due to their remarkable robustness to disorder and local boundary deformations, which cannot result in scattering of the energy of the edge states impinging on such defects into the bulk of material, as long as forbidden topological gap remains open in its spectrum. The velocity of the such states traveling along the edge of the topological insulator is typically determined by their Bloch momentum. In contrast, here, using valley Hall edge states forming at the domain wall between two honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry, we show that by imposing Airy envelope on them one can construct edge states which, on the one hand, exhibit \textit{self-acceleration} along the boundary of the insulator despite their fixed Bloch momentum and, on the other hand, \textit{do not diffract} along the boundary despite the presence of localized features in their shapes. We construct both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating edge states, and show that nonlinearity considerably affects their envelopes. Such self-accelerating edge states exhibit self-healing properties typical for nondiffracting beams. Self-accelerating valley Hall edge states can circumvent sharp corners, provided the oscillating tail of the self-accelerating topological state is properly apodized by using an exponential function. Our findings open new prospects for control of propagation dynamics of edge excitations in topological insulators and allow to study rich phenomena that may occur upon interactions of nonlinear envelope topological states.</description>

      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, for example, in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study theoretically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their analysis. Here, we characterize glassy dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition, a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum. We show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation, and thus, we propose a model-agnostic signature for robustly detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of a one-dimensional ODE and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>
