      <title>Hole in the Deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable, $A_{node}$, that allows to isolate the node in the S-partial wave distribution of the deuteron in high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes with tensor polarized target. The node is a signature of nuclear repulsive core and represents a crucial test of its strength, size as well as the role of the relativistic and non-nucleonic effects in a deeply bound state. Within plane wave impulse approximation the node immitates a ``hole" through which incoming probe passes through without interaction. It is demonstrated that high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes due to their strong anisotropy of final state interaction effects, allow to gain an unprecedented access to the node, opening up a new venue in probing elusive dynamics of the nuclear repulsive core.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and coherence of the wobbling mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement and coherence of the wobbling mode are studied in the framework of the particle plus triaxial rotor model for the one-quasiparticle nucleus $^{135}$Pr and the two-quasiparticles nucleus $^{130}$Ba. The focus lies on the coupling between the total and the particle angular momenta. Using the Schmidt decomposing, it is quantified in terms of the von Neumann entropy of the respective sub-systems, which measures their mutual entanglement. The entropy and the entanglement increase with spin $I$ and number of wobbling quanta $n$. The coherence of the wobbling mode is studied by means of the eigenstate decomposition of its reduced density matrix. To a good approximation, the probability distributions of the total angular momentum can be interpreted as the incoherent combination of the coherent contributions from the first two pairs of eigenvectors with the largest weight of the reduced density matrix. Decoherence measures are defined, which, in accordance, scatter between 0.1 to 0.2 at low spin and between 0.1 and 0.3 at high spin. Entanglement in the framework of the adiabatic approximation is further analyzed. In general, the coherent eigenstates of the effective collective Hamiltonian approximate the reduced density matrix with the limited accuracy of its pair of eigenstates with the largest weight. As the adiabatic approximation becomes more accurate with decreasing excitation energy, the probability distribution of the angle of the total angular momentum around a principal axis approaches the one of the full reduced density matrix. The $E2$ transition probabilities and spectroscopic quadrupole moments reflect this trend.</description>

      <title>A further study on the renormalization group aspect of perturbative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I perform a further study regarding a renormalization-group (RG) issue -- which concerns a wide variety of the so-called perturbative power counting under effective field theories (EFT) -- as pointed out by A. M. Gasparyan and E. Epelbaum [Phys. Rev. C 107, 034001 (2023)]. I show that the issue could originate from a wrong power counting, or from treating those incomplete, truncated amplitudes beyond the degree to which they should be trusted. Meanwhile, under EFT principles, one should always associate the result with an uncertainty that is adequate to its EFT order. One way to accommodate this is to encode its effect in a more general form of contact terms. In this regard, no RG issue is found in the $^3$P$_0$ nucleon-nucleon scattering under the Long and Yang power counting. In contrast, the RG issue under Weinberg's pragmatic proposal remains a problem even with uncertainty taken into account.</description>

      <title>Shell Effects in Quasi-fission in Reactions Forming 226Th Compound Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-fission (QF) reactions occur in fully damped heavy-ion collisions without the formation of an equilibrated compound nucleus, leading to the formation of fragments with similar properties as in fission reactions. Similar shell effects are expected to affect fragment formation in both fission and QF. Our purpose is to investigate QF dynamics in different reactions forming the same compound nucleus and search for possible signatures of shell effects in fragment formation. 50Ca+176Yb and 96Zr+130Sn QF reactions are simulated with the time-dependent Hartree-Fock code Sky3D near the Coulomb barrier. Evolutions of the quadrupole (Q20) and octupole (Q30) moments are interpreted in terms of features of the potential energy surface (PES) of the 226Th compound nucleus. Both reactions encounter QF. In 50Ca+176Yb, those only occur at finite angular momenta. In the more symmetric 96Zr+130Sn reaction with stronger Coulomb repulsion in the entrance channel, QF also occurs in central collisions. In agreement with earlier predictions, 50Ca+176Yb encounters partial mass equilibration that is stopped when the heavy fragment reaches Z~54 protons, as in the asymmetric fission mode of 226Th. 96Zr+130Sn encounters an inverse QF also leading to similar fragments as in asymmetric fission. In both systems, QF trajectories in the Q20-Q30 plane follow the asymmetric fission valley of 226Th PES. The observation of an inverse QF is a clear prediction that shell effects have a strong influence in QF. The similarity between fragments formed in asymmetric fission and QF supports the idea that the same shell effects are at play in both mechanisms. Interpreting QF dynamics with PES used in fission is naturally limited by the fact that these PES are usually computed with axial symmetry, no angular momentum and no excitation energy, thus motivating future developments of PES for QF.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluctuations of matter composition and quark nucleation in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that quark deconfined matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Here we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavour quark matter. At finite temperature, thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Being nucleation a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures $\sim (0.1-1)$ keV. However, for temperatures $\lesssim (1-10)$ MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei from coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method to describe electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei with two nucleons outside a closed shell. This approach combines the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for such systems and the Lorentz integral transform technique, expanding the applicability of coupled-cluster theory for these properties beyond closed-shell nuclei. To validate this new approach, we compute the non-energy-weighted dipole sum rule and the dipole polarizability of $^{16,24}$O in both the closed-shell and the new equation-of-motion coupled-cluster frameworks, finding agreement within error bars. We then analyze the evolution of the dipole polarizability along the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. Our predictions agree well with available experimental data and other available theoretical calculations for the closed-shell $^{16,22}$O and the open-shell $^{18}$O. In the calcium isotopes, we observe that our dipole polarizability predictions for open-shell nuclei are lower than those of closed-shell nuclei. Our predictions for $^{24}$O and $^{54,56}$Ca will motivate future experimental studies at the dripline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Correlating $B\to K^{(\ast)} \nu\bar{\nu}$ and flavor anomalies in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent measurement of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by Belle-II reveals a $2.8~\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. Combining this with a prior Belle measurement of $\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu})$, the upper bound of the ratio $\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu})/\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ is notably smaller than the SM prediction. In this work, tensions are solved within the framework of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Flavor observables, described by Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT) operators, are interconnected by SMEFT at the electroweak scale. Utilizing a set of only four SMEFT operators, the FCNC process $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$ is correlated with $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$, $b\to u_i\ell\bar{\nu}$, $u_j\to s\ell\bar{\nu}$, $u_j\to u_i\nu\bar{\nu}$, and $u_j\to u_i\ell^+\ell^-$. Subsequently, we obtain the latest ranges of Wilson coefficients for these four operators through a global fit that accommodates flavor anomalies such as $R_{K^{(\ast)}}$, $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$, and $\mathcal{B}(B\to K^{(\ast)}\nu\bar{\nu})$. Our findings reveal that predictions for $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau)$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau)$ align well with measured values from Belle and BESIII, based on the fitted coefficients. The predicted branching fraction for $B^0\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu}$ is $(1.42\pm 0.74)\times 10^{-5}$, closely approaching the current experimental upper limit. Anticipation surrounds the rare decay $B_s\to \tau^+ \tau^-$, expected in the near future with a branching fraction on the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven entanglement forging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating physical systems with variational quantum algorithms is a well-studied approach, but it is challenging to implement in current devices due to demands in qubit number and circuit depth. We show how limited knowledge of the system, namely the entropy of its subsystems, its entanglement structure or certain symmetries, can be used to reduce the cost of these algorithms with entanglement forging. To do so, we simulate a Fermi-Hubbard one-dimensional chain with a parametrized hopping term, as well as atomic nuclei ${}^{28}$Ne and ${}^{60}$Ti with the nuclear shell model. Using an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver we find significant reductions in both the maximum number of qubits (up to one fourth) and the amount of two-qubit gates (over an order of magnitude) required in the quantum circuits. Our findings indicate that our method, entropy-driven entanglement forging, can be used to adjust quantum simulations to the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Finite- and infinite-volume study of $DD\pi$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>
