      <title>Using utility graphs to search for Pareto-optimal outcomes in complex, interdependent issue negotiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how utility graphs decomposition algorithms can be used to effectively search for Pareto-efficient outcomes in complex automated negotiation. We propose a number of algorithms that can efficiently handle high-dimensional utility graphs, and test them on a variety of utility graph topologies, generated based on state of the art methods for analysing complex graphs. We show that we can achieve exponential speed-up, for many structures, even for very large utility graphs. To our knowledge, our approach can handle the largest utility spaces to date for complex interdependent negotiations, in terms of number of issues. Moreover, we examine the performance of our algorithms across two different types of elicitation queries from the literature: value and comparison queries, thus making a connection between automated negotiation and the preference elicitation literature.</description>

      <title>Statistical Model Checking of NetLogo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining increasing traction in several domains, due to their ability to represent complex systems that are not easily expressible with classical mathematical models. This expressivity and richness come at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making their analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the analyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many independent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should be discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model run? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules of thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly because addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their limited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology, drawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and provide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the most popular ABM platforms. We discuss MultiVeStA, a tool that dramatically reduces the time and human intervention needed to run statistically rigorous checks on ABM outputs, and introduce its integration with NetLogo. Using two ABMs from the NetLogo library, we showcase MultiVeStA's analysis capabilities for NetLogo ABMs, as well as a novel application to statistically rigorous calibration. Our tool-chain makes it immediate to perform statistical checks with NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable analyses of ABM outputs.</description>

      <title>SafeDiver: Cooperative AUV-USV Assisted Diver Communication via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</description>

      <title>MALLM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium and Belief Evolution in Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates differential games with motion-payoff uncertainty in continuous-time settings. We propose a framework where players update their beliefs about uncertain parameters using continuous Bayesian updating. Theoretical proofs leveraging key probability theorems demonstrate that players' beliefs converge to the true parameter values, ensuring stability and accuracy in long-term estimations. We further derive Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous Bayesian updating for players, emphasizing the role of belief updates in decision-making processes. Additionally, we establish the convergence of Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous Bayesian updating. The efficacy of both continuous and dynamic Bayesian updating is examined in the context of pollution control games, showing convergence in players' estimates under small time intervals in discrete scenarios.</description>

      <title>ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Gathering of Opaque Robots with Mobility Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental benchmarking problem of gathering in an $(N,f)$-fault system consisting of $N$ robots, of which at most $f$ might fail at any execution, under asynchrony. Two seminal results established impossibility of a solution in the oblivious robot (OBLOT) model in a $(2,0)$-fault system under semi-synchrony and in a $(3,1)$-Byzantine fault system under asynchrony. Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first impossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault system under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored lights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering in a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this paper, we consider a {\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only impacts it mobility but not the operation of the light.
  We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault model. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility fault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored lights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an $(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f&lt;N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two deterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first with time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time $O(\max\{\ell,f\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\ell&lt; N$ is the number of distinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration. Interestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal. Our algorithms for an $(N,f)$-mobility fault system are the first to be analysed time complexity, can withstand obstructed visibility (opaque robot model) and asynchronous scheduling.</description>

      <title>AgentArch: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate Agent Architectures in Enterprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</description>

      <title>Agentic Lybic: Multi-Agent Execution System with Tiered Reasoning and Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11067v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce Agentic Lybic, a novel multi-agent system where the entire architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations, Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark, Agentic Lybic achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.</description>

      <title>Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perfect clone in an ordinal election (i.e., an election where the voters rank the candidates in a strict linear order) is a set of candidates that each voter ranks consecutively. We consider different relaxations of this notion: independent or subelection clones are sets of candidates that only some of the voters recognize as a perfect clone, whereas approximate clones are sets of candidates such that every voter ranks their members close to each other, but not necessarily consecutively. We establish the complexity of identifying such imperfect clones, and of partitioning the candidates into families of imperfect clones. We also study the parameterized complexity of these problems with respect to a set of natural parameters such as the number of voters, the size or the number of imperfect clones we are searching for, or their level of imperfection.</description>

      <title>AMLNet: A Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Generate and Detect Realistic Money Laundering Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</description>

      <title>CodeCureAgent: Automatic Classification and Repair of Static Analysis Warnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static analysis tools are widely used to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually. Because this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading to an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper presents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to automatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike previous work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead, we adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather additional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the codebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false positives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent with a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2) verify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3) run the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube warnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our approach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate, respectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of 86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings. The approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end processing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent helping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines to prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Browsing: A Human-in-the-Loop Conceptual Framework Informed by Human Web Browsing for Browser-Using Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although browser-using agents (BUAs) show promise for web tasks and automation, most BUAs terminate after executing a single instruction, failing to support users' complex, nonlinear browsing with ambiguous goals, iterative decision-making, and changing contexts. We present a human-in-the-loop (HITL) conceptual framework informed by theories of human web browsing behavior. The framework centers on an iterative loop in which the BUA proactively proposes next actions and the user steers the browsing process through feedback. It also distinguishes between exploration and exploitation actions, enabling users to control the breadth and depth of their browsing. Consequently, the framework aims to reduce users' physical and cognitive effort while preserving users' traditional browsing mental model and supporting users in achieving satisfactory outcomes. We illustrate how the framework operates with hypothetical use cases and discuss the shift from manual browsing to interaction-driven browsing. We contribute a theoretically informed conceptual framework for BUAs.</description>

      <title>Co-Alignment: Rethinking Alignment as Bidirectional Human-AI Cognitive Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12179v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.</description>

      <title>AgentDynEx: Nudging the Mechanics and Dynamics of Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model simulations have the potential to model complex human behaviors and interactions. If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents: a pursuer, an evader, and a defender. Cooperative guidance laws are developed for the evader-defender team that guarantee interception of the pursuer by the defender before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, a geometry-based solution is proposed to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another notable feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy, yet the pursuer's interception is guaranteed for arbitrary initial engagement geometries. It is further shown that the relevant error variables for the evader-defender team (or individual) converge to zero at a prespecified finite time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative pursuit-evasion strategy is demonstrated through simulations across diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication. The code supporting this work is available at https://github.com/Manishms18/Adaptive-Multi-Dimensional-Monitoring.</description>
