      <title>Introducing the Physics of Complex Systems through Videogames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to explore a teaching methodology aimed at communicating topics and subjects not typically studied and analyzed in the (Italian) secondary school. We focused specifically on the use of videogames as a recreational and educational tool, grounding our approach in a broadened conceptual view in which engagement and attentional allocation interact with motivational and affective components of play. Within this perspective, the playful format is considered not only to enhance motivation and enjoyment, but also to attenuate learners' counter-arguing tendencies when confronted with unfamiliar or abstract material. Building on this framework, we developed or adapted several videogames whose central scientific topics are phase transitions, sensitivity to initial conditions, and synchronization. We had a certain number of high school students playing the games, and we asked them several questions to guide them and determine whether the communication was successful. At the end of the activity, we administered a questionnaire about the enjoyment and the difficulties encountered in each game, and the relevant critics.</description>

      <title>SMARTHEP: training PhD students in real-time analysis at the LHC and in industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this invited Editorial for Software and Computing for Big Science, we describe the SMARTHEP Innovative Training Network funded via the Marie Sk{\l}odowska-Curie Actions between 2021 and 2025. SMARTHEP trained 12 PhD students to advance machine learning and real-time analysis in high-energy physics experiments and industrial applications. We present the perspective of students, supervisors, and external observers of the network, concerning the work done within the network, the added value compared to ``typical'' PhD positions, and the emerging themes and directions from our experiences in the past four years.</description>

      <title>Living in the tensions: Investigations of gender performativity in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with four women to explore how they perceive themselves with respect to three gender constructs (femininity, masculinity, androgyny), and how they believe others perceive them. All the women highlighted the performative nature of gender in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), citing (1) stereotypes that women are not analytical thinkers, or femininity being associated with "being stupid"; (2) the pressure to conform to the masculine norms of STEM, and (3) a pressure to perform to prove that they belong in STEM. Some of these women aligned their own perceptions of their gender with these norms, while others expressed frustration with the tension between their gender and how that is perceived by peers in STEM. This work suggests that conceptualizing gender as performance is a useful lens for understanding the oppression and underrepresentation of women and gender minorities in STEM.</description>

      <title>Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistent underrepresentation of women and gender minorities within the physical sciences remains a significant issue. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory algebra-based physics laboratories, focusing on participation, task preferences, and comfort levels. Statistical analysis revealed no significant gender difference in overall participation rates during lab activities. However, significant gender-based disparities emerged in both task preference [\(\chi^2(\text{df}=3) = 9.548,~ p = 0.023, ~ \alpha = 0.05 \)] and comfort levels [\(\chi^2(\text{df}=3) = 7.906,~ p = 0.048, ~ \alpha = 0.05\)]. Male students significantly preferred and felt more comfortable with hands-on equipment handling and data collection, whereas female students more frequently preferred and reported higher comfort with analytical and documentation tasks like note-taking, calculations, and report writing. Qualitative responses highlighted additional challenges reported by some women, including exclusion from group discussions and reluctance to contribute ideas in male-dominated groups. These findings suggest that while overall participation may appear gender-neutral, gendered patterns in task allocation and comfort persist. The results underscore the need for instructional strategies that promote equitable engagement and foster inclusive laboratory environments in physics education.</description>
