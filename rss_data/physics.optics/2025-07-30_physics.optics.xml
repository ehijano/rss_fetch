      <title>High-efficiency and broadband coherent optical comb generation in integrated X-cut lithium niobate microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate efficient and coherent frequency combs using photonic integrated circuits offers tremendous potential for a range of applications. In particular, "microcombs" based on chip-integrated resonators are poised to revolutionize optical communication, computation, and sensing systems, especially when paired with fast electro-optic (EO) devices. X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a promising platform for developing the next-generation of microcomb-driven integrated photonic systems, providing a diversity of functionalities through combined $\chi^{(3)}$ and EO nonlinearities. In this context, normal-dispersion Kerr microcombs are critically needed because of their standout advantages, yet this dispersion regime remains unexplored for comb generation on X-cut TFLN. Here, we leverage ultralow-loss photonic waveguides, as well as strategic resonator designs that allow us to tailor Raman effects and engineer desired spatial mode interactions, for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr microcombs. Specifically, we show microcombs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art bright cavity soliton and EO microcombs on X-cut TFLN in key performance metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel microcomb whose existence is underpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman scattering, in a single spatial mode of a microresonator. This microcomb manifests itself as two interleaved frequency combs centered about the pump and Stokes frequencies, resulting in extended spectral spans. Our work will unlock high-speed and low energy consumption photonic circuits for communications, frequency synthesis, and signal processing enabled by a monolithic microcomb technology, while also stimulating further investigations of new nonlinear states that may synergize the strong hybrid nonlinearities unique to X-cut TFLN.</description>

      <title>Zone-sectored organic crystals with spatially resolved exciton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the organic semiconductors, rubrene stands out in terms of hole mobility, luminescence yield and exciton migration distance. A novel type of rubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting zone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution, arising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit cell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal orientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially resolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has polarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high photon absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and transition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of the crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate coherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure mono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in the succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law scaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate equations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes, enabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics. These findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for photonic applications and light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spectroscopy and Microscopy with Emerging Methods in Photon-Correlation and Quantum Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics has driven major advances in our ability to generate and detect correlations between individual photons. Its principles are now increasingly translated into nanoscale characterization techniques, enhancing spectroscopy, microscopy, and metrology. In this Review, we highlight rapid progress in the field driven by advances in single-photon detectors and quantum light sources, including time-resolved single-photon counting cameras, superconducting nanowire detectors, and increasingly bright sources of entangled photons. We emphasize emerging applications in super-resolution microscopy, measurements below classical noise limits, and photon-number-resolved spectroscopy-a powerful paradigm for probing nanoscale electronic materials and molecular dynamics. We conclude by outlining key technological challenges and future opportunities across materials science and bio-nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved polarisation sensitive optical coherence tomography reveals the complex microanatomical response of cartilage to compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods for analysing cartilage microstructure under mechanical loading are largely destructive. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of using depth-resolved polarisation sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) to study the cartilage morphological response to compression. We show that depth-resolved PS-OCT reveals the microstructure of cartilage under load, and it can do so non-destructively, opening significant possibilities for enhanced clinical assessment of cartilage health by detecting deviance from normal load-bearing behaviour.</description>

      <title>Neural network enabled wide field-of-view imaging with hyperbolic metalenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrathin form factor of metalenses makes them highly appealing for novel sensing and imaging applications. Amongst the various phase profiles, the hyperbolic metalens stands out for being free from spherical aberrations and having one of the highest focusing efficiencies to date. For imaging, however, hyperbolic metalenses present significant off-axis aberrations, severely restricting the achievable field-of-view (FOV). Extending the FOV of hyperbolic metalenses is thus feasible only if these aberrations can be corrected. Here, we demonstrate that a Restormer neural network can be used to correct these severe off-axis aberrations, enabling wide FOV imaging with a hyperbolic metalens camera. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of training the Restormer network purely on simulated datasets of spatially-varying blurred images generated by the eigen-point-spread function (eigenPSF) method, eliminating the need for time-intensive experimental data collection. This reference-free training ensures that Restormer learns solely to correct optical aberrations, resulting in reconstructions that are faithful to the original scene. Using this method, we show that a hyperbolic metalens camera can be used to obtain high-quality imaging over a wide FOV of 54{\deg} in experimentally captured scenes under diverse lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Excited State Absorption Drives Low-Energy Optical Limiting in Oligothiophenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical limiting (OL), a crucial mechanism for protecting human eyes and sensitive sensors from intense radiation, relies on understanding the optical nonlinearities acting on the systems. Assessing and disentangling the effects at play is crucial to predict and control the nonlinear optical response in real materials. In this ab initio study based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we investigate non-perturbatively the absorption spectra of a set of thiophene oligomers, the building blocks of technologically relevant organic semiconductors, excited by broadband radiation of increasing intensity. Under strong electric fields, the absorption cross section grows significantly below the onset of linear excitations, exhibiting saturation typical of OL. By exciting the oligothiophenes with a train of pulses targeting the first and second excited states of each moiety and analyzing the resulting population dynamics, we reveal excited-state absorption (ESA) in the near-infrared to visible region. Our results indicate ESA as the driving mechanism for OL in oligothiophene molecules, thereby providing important insight to design novel compounds with optimized nonlinear optical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Direct single-shot phase difference retrieval of two wavelength in off-axis digital holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for direct phase difference reconstruction using single-shot dual-wavelength off-axis digital holography is presented. This approach enables direct imaging of samples with high steps without the need to reconstruct phase images at each individual wavelength. As the dual wavelengths in the reference and object arms pass through a common path in this configuration, single-wavelength arrangements can be applied. Due to the unique capability of the presented method, a sodium-vapor lamp source has been utilized to obtain two closely spaced wavelengths (${\lambda}1 = 589 nm$ and ${\lambda}2 = 589.6 nm$), with in a synthetic wavelength of ${\Lambda} = 578.8 \mu m$ in the Michelson configuration. To evaluate the validity of the method, the height of an air wedge measured using the proposed approach has been compared with the result obtained from phase unwrapping in the single-wavelength method. The capability of the proposed technique to image samples with high step structures is further demonstrated by measuring a $30 \mu m$ step height and a glass plate with a thickness of approximately $140 \mu m$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of sample thickness for hyperspectral microscopy tissue discrimination through Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) microscopy have focused on sensor and system improvements, yet sample processing remains overlooked. We conducted an analysis of the literature, revealing that 40 percent of studies do not report sample thickness. Among those that did report it, the vast majority, 98 percent, used 2 to 10 micrometer samples. This study investigates the impact of unstained sample thickness on MS/HS image quality through light transport simulations. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted on various tissue types (i.e., breast, colorectal, liver, and lung). The simulations revealed that thin samples reduce tissue differentiation, while higher thicknesses (approximately 500 micrometers) improve discrimination, though at the cost of reduced light intensity. These findings highlight the need to study and optimize sample thickness for enhanced tissue characterization and diagnostic accuracy in MS/HS microscopy.</description>

Abstract: The inkjet-fabricated liquid crystal (LC) droplet device not only capitalizes on the intrinsic birefringence properties of liquid crystals but also leverages the hemispherical shape of droplet devices on substrates. This configuration facilitates self-alignment of the LC director under the influence of surface tension. The LC droplet devices we fabricated are capable of intricate beam manipulation, encompassing both generation and analysis of light beams. Such devices possess substantial prospective applications in the fields of optical communications and light beam characterization, highlighting their significant potential for advancement in optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Universal dynamics and microwave control of programmable cavity electro-optic frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) frequency combs are foundational for metrology and spectroscopy. Specifically, microresonator-based cavity EO combs are distinguished by efficient sideband generation, precisely controlled by microwave signals, enabling high-performance integrated frequency references and pulse sources. However, the apparent simplicity of these devices, often described by the EO modulation-induced coupling of nearest-neighbor cavity modes, has limited investigations of their fundamental physics, thereby restricting their full potential. Here, we uncover the universal dynamics and complete frequency lattice connectivity underpinning cavity EO microcombs, as well as characterize the full space of nonlinear optical states, controlled by modulation depth and optical detuning, using the thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform. Leveraging this understanding, we design complex long-range couplings between cavity modes to realize programmable spectro-temporal shaping of the generated combs and pulses. We achieve three technological advances, including repetition-rate flexibility, substantial comb bandwidth extension beyond traditional scaling laws, and resonantly-enhanced flat-top spectrum. Our results provide physical insights for synchronously driven cavity-based EO systems, broadly defined, paving the way for electrically controlled and electrically enhanced comb generators for next-generation photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity electro-optic modulation for advanced pulse-comb synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However, the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning. Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold enhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries. Our findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier, unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable electro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the first SCL-band long-haul transmission using G.654.E-compliant fibre, achieving 100.8 Tb/s (GMI) over 1552 km, despite its 1520 nm cutoff wavelength. Due to the fibre's ultra-low loss and low nonlinearity, the achievable-information-rate with lumped amplification is comparable to that of G.652.D-compliant fibre links with distributed-Raman-amplification.</description>

      <title>Safety Analysis for Distributed Coupled-Cavity Laser based Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracavity laser-based systems are emerging as key enablers for next-generation wireless communications, positioning, and wireless power transfer (WPT). Distributed coupled-cavity laser (DCCL) systems, as a representative configuration, have been proposed to expand the field of view (FoV) and enhance safety. This paper investigates the safety assessment of DCCL-WPT systems through three case studies: skin safety, eye safety, and small-object intrusion sensitivity. First, we establish a safety analysis model to quantify irradiation levels on intruding objects in the beam path, which simulates intracavity beam propagation using diffraction modeling and gain-loss dynamics under case-specific boundary conditions. Next, we formulate an eye safety evaluation tailored for DCCL-WPT systems using a human head model to identify potential exposure angles and distances. Ray tracing confirms that intracavity beams are not focused onto the retina, making cornea exposure the primary consideration (irradiance is below 0.1 W/cm2). Numerical results demonstrate that DCCL-WPT achieves: i) over 600 mW charging power under skin-safe conditions at 5 m distance (100 mW over 16{\deg} FoV), and nearly 50% lower irradiance on intruding objects compared to single-cavity systems; ii) 150 mW charging power under eye-safe conditions with 650 mW 1064 nm output beam power, far beyond the typical ~10 mW eye-safe threshold; iii) high sensitivity to small-object intrusion, enabling hazard mitigation. These findings underscore the practicality of DCCL-WPT systems for mobile, long-distance, and safe energy transfer, and lay the groundwork for future safety-aware optimizations in real-world deployments.</description>

Abstract: Q-switched lasers are compact, cost-effective, and highly pulse energy-scalable sources for nanosecond-scale laser pulses. The technology has been developed for many decades and is widely used in scientific, industrial and medical applications. However, their inherently narrow bandwidth imposes a lower limit on pulse duration - typically in the few-hundred-picosecond range - limiting the applicability of Q-switched technology in fields that require ultrafast laser pulses in the few-picosecond or femtosecond regime. In contrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (&lt; 1 ps) pulses, but are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge the parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse duration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of Q-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally demonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to 24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening. We verify this result numerically and show that compression down to a few picoseconds is possible using the nanosecond MPC (nMPC).</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An \emph{Ab Initio} Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio} derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our \emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</description>

      <title>Comparison of diffuse correlation spectroscopy analytical models for cerebral blood flow measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) models have been developed to reduce the contamination of superficial signals in cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) measurements. However, a systematic comparison of these models and clear guidance on model selection are still lacking. This study compares three DCS analytical models: semi-infinite, two-layer, and three-layer, focusing on their fitting strategies, performance, and suitability for CBFi and relative CBFi (rCBFi) estimation. We simulated DCS data using a four-layer slab head model with the Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) toolkit. Multiple fitting strategies were evaluated: early time lag range (ETLR) fitting with fixed or variable beta for the semi-infinite model, and single-distance (SD) and multi-distance (MD) fitting for the two- and three-layer models. Model performance was assessed based on CBFi sensitivity, accuracy of CBFi and rCBFi recovery, resistance to signal contamination from scalp and skull, sensitivity to assumed parameter errors, and computational efficiency across source-detector separations of 20 to 35 mm. Optimal fitting methods include ETLR with fixed beta for the semi-infinite model, SD with fixed beta for the two-layer model, and MD for the three-layer model. The multi-layer models achieved higher CBFi sensitivity (up to 100%) compared to 36.8% for the semi-infinite model. The two-layer model offered the best balance of accuracy and robustness, while the three-layer model enabled simultaneous recovery of CBFi, scalp BFi, and rCBFi. The semi-infinite model was the most computationally efficient, requiring only 0.38 seconds for 500 samples, supporting its use in real-time monitoring. This work offers a practical and systematic evaluation of DCS analytical models and provides guidance for selecting the most appropriate model based on application needs.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of light by impurities in a solid transparent matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solid transparent medium with randomly positioned, immobile impurity atoms is a promising candidate for observation of Anderson localization of light in three dimensions. It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the detrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic field, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due to random local electric fields. Our calculations suggest that these complications should not impede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials provided that sufficiently high number densities of impurities can be reached. The thermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous broadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurities.</description>

      <title>Energy Time Ptychography for one-dimensional phase retrieval</title>

Abstract: Phase retrieval is at the heart of adaptive optics and modern high-resolution imaging. Without phase information, optical systems are limited to intensity-only measurements, hindering full reconstruction of object structures and wavefront dynamics essential for advanced applications. Here, we address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, which arises in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances. We leverage the M\"ossbauer effect, where nuclei scatter radiation without energy loss to the lattice, and are sensitive to their magneto-chemical environments. Rather than using traditional spectroscopy with radioactive gamma-ray sources, we measure nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain, providing superior sensitivity and faster data acquisition. Extracting spectral information from a single measurement is challenging due to the missing phase information, typically requiring extensive modeling. Instead, we use multiple energetically overlapping measurements to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response, similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging. Our robust approach can overcome the bandwidth limitations of gamma-ray sources, opening new research directions with modern X-ray sources and M\"ossbauer isotopes.</description>

      <title>Monolithically Integrated Optical Convolutional Processors on Thin Film Lithium Niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) of sufficiently large physical dimensions and high operation accuracies are envisaged as an ideal candidate for breaking the major bottlenecks in the current artificial intelligence architectures in terms of latency, energy efficiency and computational power. To achieve this vision, it is of vital importance to scale up the PNNs and in the meantime reduce the high demand on the dimensions required by the PNNs. The underlying cause of this strategy is the enormous gap between the scales of photonic and electronic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate monolithically integrated optical convolutional processors on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) to enable large-scale programmable convolution kernels and in turn greatly reduce the dimensions required by the subsequent fully connected layers. Experimental validation achieves high classification accuracies of 96%/86% on the MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and 84.6% on the AG News dataset, while dramatically reducing the required subsequent fully connected layer dimensions to 196x10 (from 784x10) and 175x4 (from 800x4), respectively. Furthermore, our devices can be driven by commercial field-programmable gate array (FPGA) systems, a unique advantage in addition to their scalable channel number and kernel size, our architecture provides a solution to build practical machine learning photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>
