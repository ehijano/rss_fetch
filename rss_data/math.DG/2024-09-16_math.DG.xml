      <title>Existence of 5 minimal tori in 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1989, B. White conjectured that every Riemannian 3-sphere has at least 5 embedded minimal tori. We confirm this conjecture for 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature. While our proof uses min-max theory, the underlying heuristics are largely inspired by mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture on several special types of Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of compact Hermitian manifolds, including the Chern flat manifolds, non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel manifolds (which contains Vaisman manifolds as a subset), and quotients of Lie groups which are either almost ableian or whose Lie algebra contains a codimension $2$ abelian ideal that is $J$-invariant. The last case presents adequate algebraic complexity which illustrates the subtlety and intricacy of Streets-Tian Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of extremal Sasaki metrics via the Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose rule from classical mirror symmetry in the context of Sasakian geometry and results on relative K-stability in the Sasaki setting developed by Boyer and van Coevering to exhibit examples of Sasaki manifolds of complexity 3 or complexity 4 that do not admit any extremal Sasaki metrics in its whole Sasaki-Reeb cone which is of Gorenstein type. Previously, examples with this feature were produced in by Boyer and van Coevering for Brieskorn-Pham polynomials or their deformations. Our examples are based on the more general framework of invertible polynomials. In particular, we construct families of examples of links with the following property: if the link satisfies the Lichnerowicz obstruction of Gauntlett, Martelli, Sparks and Yau then its Berglund-H\"ubsch dual admits a perturbation in its local moduli, a link arising from a Brieskorn-Pham polynomial, which is obstructed to admitting extremal Sasaki metrics in its whole Sasaki-Reeb cone. Most of the examples produced in this work have the homotopy type of a sphere or are rational homology spheres.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler compactification of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and Reeb dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex manifold. Assume that $Y\subset X$ is a K\"{a}hler submanifold such that $X\setminus Y$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that $(X, Y)$ is biholomorphic to the standard example $(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathbb{P}^{n-1})$. We then study certain K\"{a}hler orbifold compactifications of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and prove that on $\mathbb{C}^3$ the flat metric is the only asymptotically conical Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metric whose metric cone at infinity has a smooth link. As a key technical ingredient, a new formula for minimal discrepancy of isolated Fano cone singularities in terms of generalized Conley-Zehnder indices in symplectic geometry is derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we remove the assumption on the gradient of the Ricci curvature in Hamilton's matrix Harnack estimate for the heat equation on all closed manifolds, answering a question which has been around since the 1990s. New ingredients include a recent sharp Li-Yau estimate, construction of a suitable vector field and various use of integral arguments, iteration and a little tensor algebra.</description>

      <title>Existence of embedded minimal tori in three-spheres with positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the strong Morse inequalities for the area functional in the space of embedded tori and spheres in the three sphere. As a consequence, we prove that in the three dimensional sphere with positive Ricci curvature, there exist at least 4 distinct embedded minimal tori. Suppose in addition that the metric is bumpy, then the three-sphere contains at least 9 distinct embedded minimal tori. The proof relies on a multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory proved by the second author and X. Zhou.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of closed timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-star spacetime is the extension over the horizons and in the negative radial region of the Kerr spacetime. Despite the presence of closed timelike curves below the inner horizon, we prove that the timelike geodesics cannot be closed in the Kerr-star spacetime. Since the existence of closed null geodesics was ruled out by the author in Sanzeni [arXiv:2308.09631v3 (2024)], this result shows the absence of closed causal geodesics in the Kerr-star spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a hyperkahler manifold $M$, with $c_1(L)$ nef and not big. SYZ conjecture predicts that $L$ is semiample. We prove that this is true, assuming that $(M,L)$ has a deformation $(M',L')$ with $L'$ semiample. We introduce a version of the Teichmuller space that parametrizes pairs $(M,L)$ up to isotopy. We prove a version of the global Torelli theorem for such Teichmuller spaces and use it to deduce the deformation invariance of semiampleness.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the slice regular M\"obius transformations of the quaternionic unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the quaternionic unit ball $\mathbb{B}$, let us denote by $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ the set of slice regular M\"obius transformations mapping $\mathbb{B}$ onto itself. We introduce a smooth manifold structure on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$, for which the evaluation(-action) map of $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ on $\mathbb{B}$ is smooth. The manifold structure considered on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is obtained by realizing this set as a quotient of the Lie group $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$, Furthermore, it turns out that $\mathbb{B}$ is a quotient as well of both $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$. These quotients are in the sense of principal fiber bundles. The manifold $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4 \times S^3$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Rational Cuspidal Curves via the WDVV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a conjectural formula for the characteristic number of rational cuspidal curves in the projective plane by extending the idea of Kontsevich's recursion formula (namely, pulling back the equality of two divisors in the four pointed moduli space). The key geometric input that is needed here is that in the closure of rational cuspidal curves, there are two component rational curves which are tangent to each other at the nodal point. While this fact is geometrically quite believable, we haven't as yet proved it; hence our formula is for the moment conjectural. The answers that we obtain agree with what has been computed earlier Ran, Pandharipande, Zinger and Ernstrom and Kennedy. We extend this technique (modulo another conjecture) to obtain the characteristic number of rational quartics with an E6 singularity.</description>

Abstract: We describe some contact non-squeezing phenomena in lens spaces by defining and computing a contact capacity. This contact capacity comes from the spectral selectors constructed by Allais, Sandon and the author by the means of generating functions and Givental's non-linear Maslov index. We also discuss a potential generalization of these non-squeezing phenomena for orderable closed prequantizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $V$-minimality, for $V$ a smooth vector field on a Riemannian manifold, a natural extension of the classical notion of minimality, and we prove several basic properties. One featured example is given for locally conformal Kaehler (l.c.K) manifolds. It is well-known that in general, complex submanifolds in non-Kaehler l.c.K manifolds are not minimal. We prove that, however, they are $V$-minimal for $V$ a suitable multiple of the Lee vector field. Extending some results from \cite{AAB}, to emphasis the utility of this notion, we prove that a PHH submersion is $V$-harmonic if and only if it has minimal fibres and a PHH $V$-harmonic submersion pulls back complex submanifolds to $V$ minimal submanifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Riccati-type equation applicable to (sub-)static Einstein spaces and examine its various applications. Specifically, within the framework of conformally compactifiable manifolds, we prove a splitting theorem for the Riemannian universal covering. Furthermore, we demonstrate two distinct methods by which the Riccati equation can establish the connectivity of the conformal boundary under the static Einstein equation. Additionally, for compact static triples possessing positive scalar curvature, we establish the compactness of the universal covering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain that logarithmic Sobolev and $\mathcal{W}$- functionals have fantastic power series expansion formulas when we choose suitable test functions. By using these power series expansion formulas, we prove that if for some open subset $V$ in an $n$-dimensional manifold satisfying $$ \frac{ \int_V R d\mu}{\mathrm{Vol}(V)} \ge n(n-1)K$$ and the isoperimetric profile of $V$ satisfying $$ \operatorname{I}(V,\beta)\doteq \inf\limits_{\Omega\subset V,\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)=\beta}\mathrm{Area}(\partial \Omega) \ge \operatorname{I}(M^n_K,\beta),$$ for all $\beta&lt;\beta_0$ and some $\beta_0&gt;0$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $M^n_K$ is the space form of constant sectional curvature $K$,then $\operatorname{Sec}(x)=K$ for all $x\in V$. We also get several other new scalar curvature rigidity theorems regarding isoperimetric profile, logarithmic Sobolev inequality and Perelman's $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-functional.</description>

Abstract: On any manifold, any non-degenerate symmetric 2-form (metric) and any skew-symmetric (differential) form W can be reduced to a canonical form at any point, but not in any neighborhood: the respective obstructions being the Riemannian tensor and dW. The obstructions to flatness (to reducibility to a canonical form) are well-known for any G-structure, not only for Riemannian or symplectic structures.
  For the manifold with a nonholonomic structure (nonintegrable distribution), the general notions of flatness and obstructions to it, though of huge interest (e.g., in supergravity) were not known until recently, though particular cases were known for more than a century (e.g., any contact structure is ``flat'': it can always be reduced, locally, to a canonical form).
  We give a general definition of the NONHOLONOMIC analogs of the Riemann and Weyl tensors. With the help of Premet's theorems and a package SuperLie we calculate these tensors for the particular case of flag varieties associated with each maximal (and several other) parabolic subalgebra of each simple Lie algebra. We also compute obstructions to flatness of the G(2)-structure and its nonholonomic super counterpart.</description>

      <title>Invariants of links and 3-manifolds from graph configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this self-contained book, following Edward Witten, Maxim Kontsevich, Greg Kuperberg and Dylan Thurston, we define an invariant Z of framed links in rational homology 3-spheres, and we study its properties. The invariant Z, which is often called the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory, is valued in a graded space generated by Jacobi diagrams. It counts embeddings of this kind of unitrivalent graphs in the ambient manifold, in a sense that is explained in the book, using integrals over configuration spaces, or, in a dual way, algebraic intersections in the same configuration spaces. When the ambient manifold is the standard 3-sphere, the invariant Z is a universal Vassiliev link invariant studied by many authors including Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev, Bar-Natan, Bott and Taubes, Altsch\"uler and Freidel, Thurston and Poirier... This book contains a more flexible definition of this invariant. We extend Z to a functor on a category of framed tangles in rational homology cylinders and we describe the behaviour of this functor under various operations including some cabling operations. We also compute iterated derivatives of our extended invariant with respect to the discrete derivatives associated to the main theories of finite type invariants. Together with recent results of Massuyeau and Moussard, our computations imply that the restriction of Z to rational homology 3-spheres (equipped with empty links) contains the same information as the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki LMO invariant for these manifolds. They also imply that the degree one part of Z is the Casson-Walker invariant.</description>

      <title>Preludes to the Eilenberg-Moore and the Leray-Serre spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leray-Serre and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences are fundamental tools for computing the cohomology of a group or, more generally, of a space. We describe the relationship between these two spectral sequences when both of them share the same abutment. There exists a joint tri-graded refinement of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence. This refinement involves two more spectral sequences, the preludes from the title, which abut to the initial terms of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence, respectively. We show that one of these always degenerates from its second page on and that the other one satisfies a local-to-global property: It degenerates for all possible base spaces if and only if it does so when the base space is contractible.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills wormholes haunted by a phantom field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Vector bundle automorphisms preserving Morse-Bott foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{F}$ a Morse-Bott foliation on $M$ with a compact critical manifold $\Sigma$. Denote by $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ leaving invariant each leaf of $\mathcal{F}$. Under certain assumptions on $\mathcal{F}$ it is shown that the computation of the homotopy type of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ reduces to three rather independent groups: the group of diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$, the group of vector bundle automorphisms of some regular neighborhood of $\Sigma$, and the subgroup of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed near $\Sigma$. Examples of computations of homotopy types of groups $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ for such foliations are also presented.</description>

      <title>Determinants of pseudo-laplacians and $\zeta^{({\rm reg})}(1)$ for spinor bundles over Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a point of a compact Riemann surface $X$. We study self-adjoint extensions of the Dolbeault Laplacians in hermitian line bundles $L$ over $X$ initially defined on sections with compact supports in $X\backslash\{P\}$. We define the $\zeta$-regularized determinants for these operators and derive comparison formulas for them. We introduce the notion of the Robin mass of $L$. This quantity enters the comparison formulas for determinants and is related to the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for the Dolbeault Laplacian. For spinor bundles of even characteristic, we find an explicit expression for the Robin mass. In addition, we propose an explicit formula for the Robin mass in the scalar case. Using this formula, we describe the evolution of the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for scalar Laplacian under the Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we find an alternative proof for the Morpurgo result that the round metric minimizes the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for surfaces of genus zero.</description>

      <title>On Character Variety of Anosov Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the free group $F_k$ of $k$ generators, $k \geq 2$, resp. the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ of a closed, connnected, orientatble surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the charater variety of irreducible, resp. Zariski dense, Anosov representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n, \C)$ is a complex manifold of (complex) dimension $(k-1)(n^2-1)$, resp. $(2g-2) (n^2-1)$. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>
