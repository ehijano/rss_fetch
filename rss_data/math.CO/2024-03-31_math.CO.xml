      <title>Piercing independent sets in graphs without large induced matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, denote by $h(G)$ the smallest size of a subset of $V(G)$ which intersects every maximum independent set of $G$. We prove that any graph $G$ without induced matching of size $t$ satisfies $h(G)\le \omega(G)^{3t-3+o(1)}$. This resolves a conjecture of Hajebi, Li and Spirkl (Hitting all maximum stable sets in $P_{5}$-free graphs, JCTB 2024).</description>

      <title>Equality of skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of classifying when two skew Schur functions are equal is a substantial open problem, which remains unsolved for over a century. In 2022, Aliniaeifard, Li and van Willigenburg introduced skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables, $s_{(\delta,D)}$, where $D$ is a connected skew diagram with $n$ boxes and $\delta$ is a permutation in the symmetric group $S_n$.
  In this paper, we combine these two and classify when two skew Schur functions in noncommuting variables are equal: $s_{(\delta,D)} = s_{(\tau,T)}$ such that $D\ne T$ if and only if $D$ is a nonsymmetric ribbon, $T$ is the antipodal rotation of $D$ and $\overline{\tau^{-1}\delta}$ is an explicit bijection between two set partitions determined by $D$.</description>

      <title>BRK-type sets over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Besicovitch-Rado-Kinney (BRK) set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a Borel set that contains a $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$, for each $r&gt;0$. It is known that such sets have Hausdorff dimension $n$ from the work of Kolasa and Wolff. In this paper, we consider an analogous problem over a finite field, $\mathbb{F}_q$. We define BRK-type sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, and establish lower bounds on the size of such sets using techniques introduced by Dvir's proof of the finite field Kakeya conjecture.</description>

      <title>Paint cost spectrum of perfect $k$-ary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the paint cost spectrum for perfect $k$-ary trees.
  A coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ with $d$ colors is said to be \emph{$d$-distinguishing} if only the trivial automorphism preserves the color classes. The smallest such $d$ is the distinguishing number of $G$ and is denoted $\mbox{dist}(G).$ The \emph{paint cost of $d$-distinguishing $G$}, denoted $\rho^d(G)$, is the minimum size of the complement of a color class over all $d$-distinguishing colorings. A subset $S$ of the vertices of $G$ is said to be a \emph{fixing set} for $G$ if the only automorphsim that fixes the vertices in $S$ pointwise is the trivial automorphism. The cardinality of a smallest fixing set is denoted $\mbox{fix}(G)$. In this paper, we explore the breaking of symmetry in perfect $k$-ary trees by investigating what we define as the \emph{paint cost spectrum} of a graph $G$: $(\mbox{dist}(G); \rho^{\mbox{dist}(G)}(G), \rho^{\mbox{dist}(G)+1}(G), \dots, \rho^{\mbox{fix}(G)+1}(G))$ and the \emph{paint cost ratio} of $G$, which is defined to be the fraction of paint costs in the paint cost spectrum equal to $\mbox{fix}(G)$. We determine both the paint cost spectrum and the paint cost ratio completely for perfect $k$-ary trees.
  We also prove a lemma that is of interest in its own right: given an $n$-tuple, $n \geq 2$ of distinct elements of an ordered abelian group and $1 \leq k \leq n! -1$, there exists a $k \times n$ row permuted matrix with distinct column sums.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-girth-regular graphs (abbreviated as \emph{egr} graphs) are regular graphs in which every edge is contained in the same number of shortest cycles. We prove that there is no $3$-regular \emph{egr} graph with girth $7$ such that every edge is on exactly $6$ shortest cycles, and there is no $3$-regular \emph{egr} graph with girth $8$ such that every edge is on exactly $14$ shortest cycles. This was conjectured by Goedgebeur and Jooken. A few other unresolved cases are settled as well.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for graph theory, II. Small Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe here how the recent Wagner's approach for applying reinforcement learning to construct examples in graph theory can be used in the search for critical graphs for small Ramsey numbers. We illustrate this application by providing lower bounds for the small Ramsey numbers $R(K_{2,5}, K_{3,5})$, $R(B_3, B_6)$ and $R(B_4, B_5)$ and by improving the lower known bound for $R(W_5, W_7)$.</description>

      <title>A general method to find the spectrum and eigenspaces of the $k$-token of a cycle, and 2-token through continuous fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-token graph $F_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-subsets of vertices from $G$, two of which being adjacent whenever their symmetric difference is a pair of adjacent vertices in $G$. In this paper, we propose a general method to find the spectrum and eigenspaces of the $k$-token graph $F_k(C_n)$ of a cycle $C_n$. The method is based on the theory of lift graphs and the recently introduced theory of over-lifts. In the case of $k=2$, we use continuous fractions to derive the spectrum and eigenspaces of the 2-token graph of $C_n$.</description>

      <title>A topology on the poset of quiver mutation classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers (and more generally skew-symmetrizable matrices), we have constructed a topology on the set of all mutation classes of quivers which we call the mutation class topology. This topology is the Alexandrov topology induced by the poset structure on the set of mutation classes of quivers from the partial order of quiver embedding. The closed sets of our topology -- equivalently, the lower sets of the poset -- are in bijective correspondence with mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers. The mutation class space described in this paper is the unique topological space with this property. We show that this space is strictly $T_0$, connected, non-Noetherian, and that every open set is dense. We close by providing open questions from cluster algebra theory in the setting of the mutation class topology and some directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Reverse Degree-Based Topological Indices and QSPR Analysis of Cancer Drugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological index of a graph $G$ is a numerical quantity that describes its topology. Reverse degree-based topological indices play an important role in finding topological descriptors. Azacitidine, Decitabine, and Guadecitabine are hypomethylating agents which are used for the treatment of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia which are not suitable for in-depth treatments such as induction chemotherapy. In this article, some reverse degree-based topological indices of the three said drugs are computed. Furthermore, QSPR analysis of the said topological indices is discussed and it is shown that these topological indices are highly correlated with the physical properties of the three cancer drugs. These findings may help chemists and people working in the pharmaceutical industry to predict the properties of cancer drugs without experimenting.</description>

      <title>Mekler's Construction and Murphy's Law for 2-Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct the first examples of strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on the transfer of burden.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1704.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper algebraic and combinatorial properties and a computation of the number of the spanning trees are developed for certain graphs. To this purpose, an original method, independent of the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix associated to the graph, is discussed. It represents an alternative process to compute how many and which are the spanning trees of any graph and substantially consists in joining the spanning trees on the ground of the number of common edges between the inner cycles of it. The algorithm and its source code for determining the collection of all edge-sets of the spanning trees for the class of Jahangir graphs are displayed. An application involving such graphs in order to get a satisfactory degree of security in transmitting confidential information is given, and finally symmetry properties of them are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Describing Quasi-Graphic Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.00489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of quasi-graphic matroids recently introduced by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle generalises each of the classes of frame matroids and lifted-graphic matroids introduced earlier by Zaslavsky. For each biased graph $(G, \mathcal B)$ Zaslavsky defined a unique lift matroid $L(G, \mathcal B)$ and a unique frame matroid $F(G, \mathcal B)$, each on ground set $E(G)$. We show that in general there may be many quasi-graphic matroids on $E(G)$ and describe them all. We provide cryptomorphic descriptions in terms of subgraphs corresponding to circuits, cocircuits, independent sets, and bases. Equipped with these descriptions, we prove some results about quasi-graphic matroids. In particular, we provide alternate proofs that do not require 3-connectivity of two results of Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle for 3-connected matroids from their introductory paper: namely, that every quasi-graphic matroid linearly representable over a field is either lifted-graphic or frame, and that if a matroid $M$ has a framework with a loop that is not a loop of $M$ then $M$ is either lifted-graphic or frame. We also provide sufficient conditions for a quasi-graphic matroid to have a unique framework.
  Zaslavsky has asked for those matroids whose independent sets are contained in the collection of independent sets of $F(G, \mathcal B)$ while containing those of $L(G, \mathcal B)$, for some biased graph $(G, \mathcal B)$. Adding a natural (and necessary) non-degeneracy condition defines a class of matroids, which we call biased graphic. We show that the class of biased graphic matroids almost coincides with the class of quasi-graphic matroids: every quasi-graphic matroid is biased graphic, and if $M$ is a biased graphic matroid that is not quasi-graphic then $M$ is a 2-sum of a frame matroid with one or more lifted-graphic matroids.</description>

      <title>On three domination-based identification problems in block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09537v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems of determining the minimum-sized \emph{identifying}, \emph{locating-dominating} and \emph{open locating-dominating codes} of an input graph are special search problems that are challenging from both theoretical and computational viewpoints. In these problems, one selects a dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ such that the vertices of a chosen subset of $V(G)$ (i.e. either $V(G)\setminus C$ or $V(G)$ itself) are uniquely determined by their neighborhoods in $C$. A typical line of attack for these problems is to determine tight bounds for the minimum codes in various graphs classes. In this work, we present tight lower and upper bounds for all three types of codes for \emph{block graphs} (i.e. diamond-free chordal graphs). Our bounds are in terms of the number of maximal cliques (or \emph{blocks}) of a block graph and the order of the graph. Two of our upper bounds verify conjectures from the literature - with one of them being now proven for block graphs in this article. As for the lower bounds, we prove them to be linear in terms of both the number of blocks and the order of the block graph. We provide examples of families of block graphs whose minimum codes attain these bounds, thus showing each bound to be tight.</description>

      <title>Linear Hashing with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees and two-sided Kakeya bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense. More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L : \mathbb{F}_q^n \to \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $ |S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. In other words, {\em every} element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions [ADMPT99]. By known bounds from the load balancing literature [RS98], our results are tight and show that linear functions hash as well as trully random function up to a constant factor in the entropy loss. Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</description>

Abstract: The twist polynomial of a delta-matroid was recently introduced by Yan and Jin, who proved a characterization of binary delta-matroids with twist monomials. In this paper, we extend this result to all delta-matroids by proving that any delta-matroid with a twist monomial must be binary.</description>

      <title>Production optimization by agents of differing work rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a scheme for producing, in the least possible time, $n$ identical objects with $p$ agents that work at differing speeds. This involves halting the process in order to transfer production across agent types. For the case of two types of agent, we construct a scheme based on the Euclidean algorithm that seeks to minimise the number of pauses in production.</description>

      <title>On the face stratification of the $m=2$ amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study the face stratification of the m=2 amplituhedron. We show that the face poset is an upper order ideal in the face poset of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. Our construction is consistent with earlier work of Lukowski, and we confirm various predictions of Lukowski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham proposed to determine the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s = 1$ and asked, among other things, whether that number could be as large as $2^{n - o(n)}$. We show that the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s \leq 1$ is smaller than $2^{0.93n}$. We also answer another question of Erd\H{o}s-Graham by proving the existence of $\delta \in \left\{-1,0,1\right\}^n$ such that $0 &lt; \sum_{k=1}^{n} \delta_k/k \leq c \cdot 2^{-n}$ where $c$ is independent of $n$.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <title>Graphs and groups with unique geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if there is a unique geodesic between each pair of vertices. In this paper we prove that if a finitely generated group admits a Cayley graph which is geodetic, then the group must be virtually free. Before now, it was open whether finitely generated and geodetic implied hyperbolic. In fact we prove something more general: if a quasi-transitive locally finite connected undirected graph is geodetic then it is quasi-isometric to a tree. Our main tool is to define a \emph{boundary} of a graph and understand how the local behaviour influences it when the graph is geodetic. Our results unify, and represent significant progress on, research initiated by Ore, Shapiro, and Madlener and Otto.</description>

      <title>Calculus of variations on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on hypergraphs.</description>
