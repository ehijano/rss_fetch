      <title>Firewalls at exponentially late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a version of the typical state firewall setup recently reintroduced by Stanford and Yang, who found that wormholes may create firewalls. We examine a late-time double scaling limit in JT gravity in which one can resum the expansion in the number of wormholes, and we use this to study the exact distribution of interior slices at times exponential in the entropy. We consider a thermofield double with and without early perturbations on a boundary. These perturbations can appear on interior slices as dangerous high energy shocks. For exponentially late times, wormholes tend to teleport the particles created by perturbations and render the interior more dangerous. In states with many perturbations separated by large times, the probability of a safe interior is exponentially small. Such states thus almost certainly have firewalls at the horizon, even though they would be safe without wormholes. With perturbation, even in the safest state we conceive, the odds of encountering a firewall are fifty-fifty. One interpretation of the phenomena found here is that wormholes can change time-ordered contours into effective out-of-time-ordered folds, making shockwaves appear in unexpected places.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Amplitudes in Power-Law FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlators of large-scale fluctuations belong to the most important observables in modern cosmology. Recently, there have been considerable efforts in analytically understanding the cosmological correlators and the related wavefunction coefficients, which we collectively call cosmological amplitudes. In this work, we provide a set of simple rules to directly write down analytical answers for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes of conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in power-law FRW universe. With the recently proposed family-tree decomposition method, we identify an over-complete set of multivariate hypergeometric functions, called family trees, to which all tree-level conformal scalar amplitudes can be easily reduced. Our method yields series expansions and monodromies of family trees in various kinematic limits, together with a large number of functional identities. The family trees are in a sense generalizations of polylogarithms and do reduce to polylogarithmic expressions for the cubic coupling in inflationary limit. We further show that all family trees can be decomposed into linear chains by taking shuffle products of all subfamilies, with which we find simple connection between bulk time integrals and boundary energy integrals.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian contours for tree-level string amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We engineer compact contours on the moduli spaces of genus-zero Riemann surfaces that achieve analytic continuation from Euclidean to Lorentzian worldsheets. These generalized Pochhammer contours are based on the combinatorics of associahedra and make the analytic properties of tree-level amplitudes entirely manifest for any number and type of external strings. We use them in practice to perform first numerical computations of open and closed string amplitudes directly in the physical kinematics for $n=4,5,6,7,8,9$. We provide a code that allows anyone to do such computations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is the Holographic Dual of Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic approximately equals the rate of change of minimal surface area in response to the change of the tension of cosmic branes in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Regge Limit of One-Loop String Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the high-energy limit of $2 \to 2$ one-loop string amplitudes at fixed momentum transfer. For the closed string, the high-energy behaviour of the amplitudes can be determined from Regge theory just like in field theory, as was first discussed by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. However, field theory intuition partially breaks down for the open-string amplitude, where amplitudes can exhibit surprising asymptotics in the high-energy limit depending on the topology of the diagram. We call this phenomenon Regge attenuation. We extract Regge limits by a combination of unitarity cuts and saddle-point analysis. We show that the leading contribution of the planar open-string amplitude is sufficiently simple that we can extract it at any loop order. This allows us to resum the genus expansion in a certain limit and demonstrate that the leading Regge trajectory remains linear in that limit.</description>

      <title>On classical de Sitter solutions and parametric control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding string backgrounds with de Sitter spacetime, where all approximations and corrections are controlled, is an open problem. We revisit the search for de Sitter solutions in the classical regime for specific type IIB supergravity compactifications on group manifolds, an under-explored corner of the landscape that offers an interesting testing ground for swampland conjectures. While the supergravity de Sitter solutions we obtain numerically are ambiguous in terms of their classicality, we find an analytic scaling that makes four out of six compactification radii, as well as the overall volume, arbitrarily large. This potentially provides parametric control over corrections. If we could show that these solutions, or others to be found, are fully classical, they would constitute a counterexample to conjectures stating that asymptotic de Sitter solutions do not exist. We discuss this point in great detail.</description>

      <title>Holography and Regge Phases with $U(1)$ Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use holography to study the large spin $J$ limit of the spectrum of low energy states with charge $Q$ under a $U(1)$ conserved current in CFTs in $d&gt;2$ dimensions, with a focus on $d=3$ and $d=4$. For $Q=2$, the spectrum of such states is known to be universal and properly captured by the long-distance limit of holographic theories, regardless of whether the CFT itself is holographic. We study in detail the holographic description of such states at $Q&gt;2$, by considering the contribution to the energies of $Q$ scalar particles coming from single photon and graviton exchange in the bulk of AdS; in some cases, scalar exchange and bulk contact terms are also included. For a range of finite values of $Q$ and $J$, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian for such states and examine the resulting spectrum and wavefunctions as a function of the dimension $\Delta$ of the charge-one operator and the central charges $c_{\mathcal{T}}, c_{\mathcal{J}}$ of the stress tensor and U(1) current, finding multiple regions in parameter space with qualitatively different behavior. We discuss the extension of these results to the regime of parametrically large charge $Q$, as well as to what extent such results are expected to hold universally, beyond the limit of holographic CFTs. We compare our holographic computations to results from the conformal bootstrap for the $3d$ O(2) model at $Q=3$ and $Q=4$ and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the ``operator size concentration'' at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Chern Characteristics and Todd-Hirzebruch Identities for Transpolar Pairs of Toric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard toric geometry methods used to construct Calabi-Yau varieties may be extended to complete intersections in non-Fano varieties encoded by star triangulating non-convex polytopes. Similarly, mirror symmetry is conjectured to hold in terms of a transpolar duality generalizing the original construction of Batyrev and Borisov. The associated mirror pairs naturally include certain flip-folded, multi-layered multihedral objects, inclusively named VEX multitopes, and a correspondingly generalized transpolar duality. These self-overlaying VEX multitopes, long since known in pre-symplectic geometry, are found to correspond to certain non-algebraic but smooth toric spaces with Chern classes that satisfy the standard Todd-Hirzebruch identities. The computation of diffeomorphism invariants, including characteristic submanifold intersection numbers, corroborates their recent inclusion in the connected web of Calabi-Yau spaces and associated string compactifications: They arise together with the standard (Fano/reflexive polytope) constructions, within deformation families of generalized complete intersections in products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Properties of Dynamical Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first law for non-stationary perturbations of a stationary black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon, that relates the first-order change in the mass and angular momentum to the change in the entropy of an arbitrary horizon cross-section. Recently, Hollands, Wald and Zhang [1] have shown that the dynamical black hole entropy that satisfies this first law, for general relativity, is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{BH}}$, where $v$ is the affine parameter of the null horizon generators and $S_{\text{BH}}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and for general diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, where $S_{\text{Wall}}$ is the Wall entropy. They obtained the first law by applying the Noether charge method to non-stationary perturbations and arbitrary cross-sections. In this formalism, the dynamical black hole entropy is defined as an "improved" Noether charge, which is unambiguous to first order in the perturbation. In the present article we provide a pedagogical derivation of the physical process version of the non-stationary first law for general relativity by integrating the linearised Raychaudhuri equation between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections. Moreover, we generalise the derivation of the first law in [1] to non-minimally coupled matter fields, using boost weight arguments rather than Killing field arguments, and we relax some of the gauge conditions on the perturbations by allowing for non-zero variations of the horizon Killing field and surface gravity. Finally, for $f(\text{Riemann})$ theories of gravity we show explicitly using Gaussian null coordinates that the improved Noether charge is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, which is a non-trivial check of [1].</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining black holes out of equilibrium with boundary observables on time slice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics, defining coarse-grained entropy for dynamical black holes has long been a challenge, and various proposals, such as generalized entropy, have been explored. Guided by the AdS/CFT, we introduce a new definition of coarse-grained entropy for a dynamical black hole in Lorentzian Einstein gravity. On each time slice, this entropy is defined as the horizon area of an auxiliary Euclidean black hole that shares the same mass, (angular) momenta, and asymptotic normalizable matter modes with the original Lorentzian solution. The entropy is shown to satisfy a generalized first law and, through holography, the second law as well. Furthermore, by applying this thermodynamics to several Vaidya models in AdS and flat spacetime, we discover a connection between the second law and the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of saxion-axion system in stringy quintessence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the slow-roll parameter in the stringy quintessence model when axion as well as saxion is allowed to move. Even though the potential is independent of the axion at tree level, the axion can move through its coupling to the saxion and the background geometry. Then the contributions of the axion kinetic energy to the slow-roll parameter and the vacuum energy density are not negligible when the slow-roll approximation does not hold. As the dimension of the field space is doubled, the fixed point at which the time variation of the slow-roll parameter vanishes is not always stable. We find that the fixed point in the saxion-axion system is at most partially stable, in particular when the volume modulus and the axio-dilaton, the essential ingredients of the string compactification, are taken into account. It seems that as we consider more saxion-axion pairs, the stability of the fixed point becomes difficult to achieve.</description>

      <title>Gauge Symmetries and Conserved Currents in AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study massless/massive vector and $p$-form field perturbations in AdS spacetime with an end-of-the-world brane. By imposing $U(1)$ preserving Neumann boundary condition on the end-of-the-world brane, we study their spectrum and discuss their implications for dual BCFT operators. When the perturbation is massless, the dual BCFT operator is a conserved current and we show that such an operator indeed satisfies the $U(1)$ preserving conformal boundary condition. On the other hand, when the perturbation is massive, in general there exists non-vanishing perpendicular components of the dual BCFT operator, even in the massless limit. We explain this difference between massless and massive perturbations from the point of view of the bulk gauge symmetry, or equivalently from different structure of equations of motion. We also find several brane-tension-independent modes in massless perturbations, and these are understood as boundary-condition-independent modes from the dual BCFT point of view.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator as a detector of baryonic phase structure in holographic QCD with a theta angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) of Skyrmion as baryon in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically dual to QCD with an non-zero theta angle. The baryon state is identified to the excitation of the Skyrmion which is described by a quantum mechanical system in holography. By employing the definition of OTOC in quantum mechanics, we derive the formulas and demonstrate explicitly the numerical calculations of the OTOC. Our calculation illustrates the quantum OTOC with imaginary Lyapunov coefficient indicates the possibly metastable baryonic status in the presence of the theta angle while the classical OTOC can not, thus it reveals the theta-dependent features of QCD are dominated basically by its quantum properties. Furthermore, the OTOC also reveals the baryonic phase becomes really chaotic with real Lyapunov exponent if the theta angle increases sufficiently which agrees with the unstable baryon spectrum presented in this model. In this sense, we believe the OTOC may be treated as a tool to detect the baryonic phase structure of QCD.</description>

      <title>On exactly solvable Yang-Baxter models and enhanced symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Yang-Baxter deformations of the flat space string that result in exactly solvable models, finding the Nappi-Witten model and its higher dimensional generalizations. We then consider the spectra of these models obtained by canonical quantization in light-cone gauge, and match them with an integrability-based Bethe ansatz approach. By considering a generalized light-cone gauge we can describe the model by a nontrivially Drinfel'd twisted S matrix, explicitly verifying the twisted structure expected for such deformations. Next, the reformulation of the Nappi-Witten model as a Yang-Baxter deformation shows that Yang-Baxter models can have more symmetries than suggested by the $r$ matrix defining the deformation. We discuss these enhanced symmetries in more detail for some trivial and nontrivial examples. Finally, we observe that there are nonunimodular but Weyl-invariant Yang-Baxter models of a type not previously considered.</description>

      <title>Phases and Duality in Fundamental Kazakov-Migdal Model on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet $\boldsymbol{AdS}$ planar and spherical black hole thermodynamics and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study in \cite{Bilic:2022psx} incorporating the $AdS$/CFT duality to establish a relationship between the local temperatures of a large ($AdS$) spherical and a ($AdS$) planar Schwarzschild black hole near the $AdS$ boundary considering Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction in the gravitational action. We have shown the finite coupling corrections appear in the local temperature relationships due to the inclusion of Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. By transforming the metric into Fefferman-Graham form, we have calculated the energy of the conformal fluid at the boundary. Following the results of fluid/gravity duality, the energy of the conformal fluid at the boundary is then compared with the black body radiation energy which eventually leads us to establish the local temperature relationship between spherical and planar black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity near the $AdS$ boundary.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for p=2 like glassy matrices in the planar approximation: I. Vertex expansion at equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equilibrium states of a $N\times N$ stochastic complex random matrix $M$, whose entries evolve in time accordingly with a Langevin equation including both Gaussian white noises and a linear disorder, materialized by the Wigner random matrices. In large $N$-limit, the disorders behave as effective kinetics, and we examine a coarse-graining over the Wigner spectrum accordingly with two different schemes that we call respectively active and passive. We then investigate explicit solutions of the nonperturbative renormalization group using vertex and derivative expansion, a simple way to deal with the nonlocal nature of the effective field theory at large $N$. Our main statement is the existence of well-behaved fixed point solutions and at least some evidence about a discontinuous (first order) phase transition between a condensed and a dilute phase. We finally interpret the resulting phase space regarding the out-of-equilibrium process related to the dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Bilocal holography and locality in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilocal holography provides a constructive approach to the vector model/higher spin gravity duality. It has two ingredients: a change of field variables and a change of space time coordinates. The change of field variables ensures that the loop expansion parameter becomes ${1\over N}$. The change of coordinates solves the Clebsch-Gordan problem of moving from the tensor product basis (in which the collective bilocal field is written) to the direct sum basis (appropriate for the description of the gravity fields). We argue that the change of space time coordinates can be deduced by requiring that operators constructed in the bilocal collective field theory are dual to local operators in the AdS bulk.</description>

      <title>Superconformal indices and localization in $N=2B$ quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconformal `type B' quantum mechanical sigma models arise in a variety of interesting contexts, such as the description of D-brane bound states in an AdS$_2$ decoupling limit. Focusing on $N=2B$ models, we study superconformal indices which count short multiplets and provide an alternative to the standard Witten index, as the latter suffers from infrared issues. We show that the basic index receives contributions from lowest Landau level states in an effective magnetic field and that, due to the noncompactness of the target space, it is typically divergent. Fortunately, the models of interest possess an additional target space isometry which allows for the definition of a well-behaved refined index. We compute this index using localization of the functional integral and find that the result agrees with a naive application of the Atiyah-Bott fixed point formula outside of it's starting assumptions. In the simplest examples, this formula can also be directly verified by explicitly computing the short multiplet spectrum.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-perfomance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

      <title>Is the effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the applicability of the effective potential within dynamical situations and find, in short, that the answer is negative. An important caveat of the use of an effective potential in dynamical equations of motion is an explicit violation of energy conservation.
  An \emph{adiabatic} effective potential is introduced in a consistent quasi-static approximation, and its narrow regime of validity is discussed. Two ubiquitous instances in which even the adiabatic effective potential is not valid in dynamics are studied in detail: parametric amplification in the case of oscillating mean fields, and spinodal instabilities associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In both cases profuse particle production is directly linked to the failure of the effective potential to describe the dynamics. We introduce a consistent, renormalized, energy conserving dynamical framework that is amenable to numerical implementation. Energy conservation leads to the emergence of asymptotic highly excited, entangled stationary states from the dynamical evolution. As a corollary, decoherence via dephasing of the density matrix in the adiabatic basis is argued to lead to an emergent entropy, formally equivalent to the entanglement entropy. The results suggest novel characterization of asymptotic equilibrium states in terms of order parameter vs. energy density.</description>

Abstract: We review the limit shape problem for the Plancherel measure and its generalizations found in supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. We focus on the measure, interpolating between the Plancherel measure and uniform measure, a U(1) case of N=2* gauge theory. We give the formula for its limit shape in terms of elliptic functions, generalizing the trigonometric ``arcsin'' law of Vershik-Kerov and Logan-Schepp.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications from some proposals in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we present the cosmological applications of some proposals from Quantum Gravity. Namely, we will explore classical and quantum cosmological implications of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity and the Swampland Conjectures. Furthermore, we will also present a detailed analysis of Lorentzian Vacuum Transitions in various contexts.
  First of all, we will present a study of the classical implications of a general form of the GUP to the standard inflationary scenario driven by a scalar field. We will then present the study of the compatibility between the dS swampland conjecture and the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz $F(\bar{R})$ theories. Then we will study the effects of considering a GUP in the variables of the superspace in a model of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation in HL gravity. Finally, we will present a general study of the Lorentzian vacuum transitions. We will present a general method to compute the transition probabilities between two minima of a scalar field potential for any model of the superspace that leads to a generic form of the Hamiltonian constraint, by solving the WDW equation with a semiclassical expansion. We will only consider up to first order in this expansion but the method provides enough information to compute the probabilities up to any desired order. We will then apply the method in different scenarios.
  With these studies we will approach keys aspects of cosmology that are hoped to be solved by quantum gravity, that is we will explore (at a toy model level): the origin of inflation, the viability of the swampland conjectures and a plausible model to avoid the initial singularity. This thesis encompasses six research articles where these results were presented originally.</description>

      <title>Integrating Gauss-Bonnet Corrections in Quantum Field Theory: Implications for Torsion, Gauge Bosons, and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore matter fields containing Gauss-Bonnet correction terms within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory. By revising the gauge model with a charged scalar multiplier and two sets of fermion families within a flat universe model using torsion, we introduce Gauss-Bonnet corrections into the action to investigate field equations within the context of supersymmetric mixed inflationary models. After analytically computing the modified gauge boson field equations through the incorporation of Gauss-Bonnet theory into the fundamental field equations, we derive the torsion characteristics and energy-momentum tensor properties of a flat universe. Our analysis can extend to more specific Gauss-Bonnet correction models, enabling the derivation of gravitational characteristic equations with practical applications. This streamlines Gauss-Bonnet models, assesses the model's sensitivity to correction parameters, and explores high-sensitivity models with observational significance. Furthermore, in this derivation process, we identify that Gauss-Bonnet correction terms can directly impact the Hubble constant through Einstein's equations, indicating the potential for verifying Gauss-Bonnet theory through astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the memory effect due to a gravitational wave striking a Kerr black hole as seen by an observer at null infinity. This is done by working in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. It was shown by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger (HPS) that the memory effect due to a gravitational shockwave is seen as a pure BMS supertranslation from null infinity. Hence, it is of interest to compute the supertranslated Kerr solution in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. Finally, the gravitational wave is said to implant soft supertranslation hair on the event horizon of the black hole which carries superrotation charge. We will explicitly calculate the change in superrotation charge on the event horizon due to the supertranslation hair.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>On Mirror Symmetry and Irrationality of Zeta Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental object of study in mirror symmetry of $n$-dimensional Fano varieties is the A-side connection on small quantum cohomology. When the Picard rank is 1, the Borel transform relates the quantum differential operator of the Fano to the Picard-Fuchs operator of the associated pencil of anticanonical Calabi-Yau $(n-1)$-folds on the Fano variety. Expanding on related work by W. Yang on the Beukers-Peters pencil of K3 surfaces associated with Ap\'ery's proof for the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, for such operators we define holomorphic prepotentials, virtual Yukawa couplings, and virtual instanton numbers, analogous to the usual ingredients of Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry. We prove that when the underlying Calabi-Yau operator is modular, the virtual Yukawa coupling is a modular form of weight-$(n+1)$, with the holomorphic prepotential as an Eichler integral. We then analyze the quantum differential operators for modular pencils of K3 surfaces arising as anticanonical linear systems for the 17 deformation classes of Fano threefolds of Picard rank-1 classified by Iskovskikh from the perspective of Golyshev \&amp; Zagier's proof of the Gamma conjecture for such Fanos, the natural setting of Yang's work. Here, the virtual instanton numbers are proven to be periodic integers with period equal to the level of the modular subgroup. Finally, we conjecture that the geometric nature of these virtual instanton numbers can be understood in terms of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of certain local Calabi-Yau fourfolds.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Vortex Phase and Magnetic Field Generation in QCD with Isospin and Baryon Chemical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryonic vortex phase in low energy dense QCD with finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate takes up the ground state in the presence of the isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex sustaining the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, given the added modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies the baryonic vortex phase would emerge spontaneously without any external magnetic field, and take over the ground state at high density. This new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and could be relevant to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and spin alignment of vector meson $J/\psi$ in a thermal magnetized background using the gauge/gravity duality. Utilizing a soft wall model for the QGP background and a massive vector field for the $J/\psi$ meson, we delve into the meson's spectral function and spin parameters $(\lambda_{\theta},\, \lambda_\varphi,\,\lambda_{\theta\varphi})$ for different cases, assessing their response to variations in magnetic field strength, momentum, and temperature. We initially examine scenarios where a meson's momentum aligns parallel to the magnetic field in helicity frame. Our results reveal a magnetic field-induced positive $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$ for low meson momentum, transitioning to negative with increased momentum. As a comparison, we also study the case of momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field and find the direction of magnetic field does not affect the qualitative behavior for the $eB$-dependence of $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$. Moreover, we apply our model to real heavy-ion collisions for three different spin quantization directions. Further comparisons with experimental data show qualitative agreement for spin parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$ and $\lambda_\varphi$ in the helicity and Collins-Soper frames.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying the spin alignment $\rho_{00}$ for flavorless vector mesons by using the gauge/gravity duality. Focusing on the dilepton production through vector meson decay, we derive the relation between production rates at each spin channel and meson's spectral function, which can be evaluated by holographic models for a strongly coupled system. As examples, we study $\rho_{00}$ for $J/\psi$ and $\phi$ mesons, induced by the relative motion to a thermal background, within the soft-wall model. We show that $\rho_{00}$ in the helicity frame for $J/\psi$ and $\phi$ mesons have positive and negative deviations from 1/3 at $T=150$ MeV, respectively, which consequently leads to different properties for their global spin alignments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study topological quantum mechanical models on symplectic orbifolds. The correlation map gives an explicit orbifold version of quantum HKR map. The exact semi-classical approximation in this model leads to a geometric and quantum field theoretic interpretation of the orbifold algebraic index.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopoles in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State at nonzero baryon density in external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. We show that condensing a $k$-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an $n$+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ amounts to a $k$-step process. In the first step, we condense $A$ along one of the transversal directions, thus obtaining a $(k-1)$-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which can be further condensed as the second step, so on and so forth. In the $k$-th step, condensing $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction defines a phase transition to a new phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$. Mathematically, a $k$-codimensional defect $A$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. In this case, $\Sigma A$ is naturally a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra, thus it can be further condensed. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ consists of all deconfined topological defects in $\mathsf C^{n+1}$. A $k$-codimensional topological defect is deconfined if and only if it is equipped with a $k$-dimensional $A$-action, which defines an $E_k$-module over $A$. When $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same condensation can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ is determined by the category of $E_2$-modules over $\Sigma^{k-2}A$. When $n=2$, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. The proofs of the most mathematical results will appear in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss some generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our condensation theory such as higher Morita theory, factorization homology and the condensation theory of non-topological defects.</description>

      <title>A Science4Peace initiative: Alleviating the consequences of sanctions in international scientific cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The armed invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has adversely affected the relations between Russia and Western countries. Among other aspects, it has put scientific cooperation and collaboration into question and changed the scientific landscape significantly. Cooperation between some Western institutions and their Russian and Belarusian partners were put on hold after February 24, 2022. The CERN Council decided at its meeting in December 2023 to terminate cooperation agreements with Russia and Belarus that date back a decade. CERN is an international institution with UN observer status, and has so far played a role in international cooperation which was independent of national political strategies. We argue that the Science4Peace idea still has a great value and scientific collaboration between scientists must continue, since fundamental science is by its nature an international discipline. A ban of scientists participating in international cooperation and collaboration is against the traditions, requirements and understanding of science. We call for measures to reactivate the peaceful cooperation of individual scientists on fundamental research in order to stimulate international cooperation for a more peaceful world in the future. Specifically, we plead for finding ways to continue this cooperation through international organizations, such as CERN and JINR.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that for a dynamical black hole in any higher derivative theory of gravity, one could construct a spatial entropy current, characterizing the in/outflow of entropy at every point on the horizon, as long as the dynamics of the amplitude is small enough. However, the construction is very much dependent on how we choose the spatial slicing of the horizon along its null generators. In this note, we have shown that though both the entropy density and the spatial entropy current change non-trivially under a reparametrization of the null generator, the net entropy production, which is given by the `time' derivative of entropy density plus the divergence of the spatial current is invariant. We have explicitly verified this claim for the particular case of dynamical black holes Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory.</description>

In the hope of providing more approachable entry point to the subject we include a detailed introduction of all necessary group theoretic tools (in a rather mathematical definition-theorem-proof style).

Abstract: We study (near-)circular orbits of charged particles in the background of charged black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes of arbitrary dimensionality. We calculate the energy and angular momentum of such particles in a large-radius limit. This allows us to compute the anomalous dimension of the dual charged double-twist operators in a large-spin expansion, making a prediction for the bootstrap analysis at large charge and spin. We relate our result to the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) for AdS black holes of all sizes. We also discuss the relation of WGC with the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Inflation Correlators with Multiple Massive Exchanges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most general tree-level boundary correlation functions of quantum fields in inflationary spacetime involve multiple exchanges of massive states in the bulk, which are technically difficult to compute due to the multi-layer nested time integrals in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. On the other hand, correlators with multiple massive exchanges are well motivated in cosmological collider physics, with the original quasi-single-field inflation model as a notable example. In this work, with the partial Mellin-Barnes representation, we derive a simple rule, called family-tree decomposition, for directly writing down analytical answers for arbitrary nested time integrals in terms of multi-variable hypergeometric series. We present the derivation of this rule together with many explicit examples. This result allows us to obtain analytical expressions for general tree-level inflation correlators with multiple massive exchanges. As an example, we present the full analytical results for a range of tree correlators with two massive exchanges.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Black Hole out of Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An often fruitful route to study quantum gravity is the determination and study of quantum mechanical models--that is, models with finite degrees of freedom--that capture the dynamics of a black hole's microstates. An example of such a model is the superconformal quantum mechanics of Yang-Mills instantons, which has a proposed gravitational dual description as M-theory on a background of the form $X_7\times S^4$. This model arises in the strongly-coupled limit of the BFSS matrix model with additional fundamental hypermultiplets, offering a route towards useful numerical simulation. We construct a six-parameter black hole solution in this theory, which is generically non-supersymmetric and non-extremal, and is shown to arise in an "ultra-spinning" limit of the recently-found six-parameter AdS$_7$ solution. We compute its thermodynamic properties, and show that in the supersymmetric limit the entropy and on-shell action match precisely the expected results as computed from the superconformal index of the quantum mechanics, to leading order in the supergravity regime. The low-lying spectrum thus provides access to the dynamics of near-extremal black holes, whose spectra are expected to receive strong quantum corrections.</description>

Abstract: We set up a unified framework to efficiently compute the shear and bulk viscosities of strongly coupled gauge theories with gravitational holographic duals involving higher derivative corrections. We consider both Weyl$^4$ corrections, encoding the finite 't Hooft coupling corrections of the boundary theory, and Riemann$^2$ corrections, responsible for non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ of the theory at the ultraviolet fixed point. Our expressions for the viscosities in higher derivative holographic models are extracted from a radially conserved current and depend only on the horizon data.</description>

      <title>Lorentz invariance violation and the CPT-odd electromagnetic response of a tilted anisotropic Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the electromagnetic response of a particular fermionic sector in the minimal QED contribution to the Standard Model Extension (SME), which can be physically realized in terms of a model describing a tilted and anisotropic Weyl semimetal (WSM). The contact is made through the identification of the Dirac-like Hamiltonian resulting from the SME with that corresponding to the WSM in the linearized tight-binding approximation. We first calculate the effective action by computing the non-perturbative vacuum polarization tensor using thermal field theory techniques, focusing upon the corrections at finite chemical potential and zero temperature. Next, we confirm our results by a direct calculation of the anomalous Hall current within a chiral kinetic theory approach.
  In an ideal Dirac cone picture of the WSM (isotropic and non-tilted) such response is known to be governed by axion electrodynamics, with the space-time dependent axion angle $\Theta (\mathbf{r},t) = 2 (\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{r} - b _{0} t)$, being $2 \mathbf{b}$ and $2b _{0}$ the separation of the Weyl nodes in momentum and energy, respectively. In this paper we demonstrate that the node tilting and the anisotropies induce novel corrections at a finite density which however preserve the structure of the axionic field theory. We apply our results to the ideal Weyl semimetal $\mathrm{EuCd}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ and to the highly anisotropic and tilted monopnictide $\mathrm{TaAs}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ species of color fermions and $N_f^2$ colorless scalars. The quantum field theory possesses a weakly interacting ultraviolet fixed point that we determine from beta functions computed up to four-loop order in the gauge coupling, and up to three-loop order in the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. The fixed point has one relevant direction giving rise to asymptotic safety. We compute fixed-point values of dimensionless couplings together with the corresponding scaling exponents up to the first three non-trivial orders in Veneziano parameter $\epsilon$, both for infinite and finite number of colors $N_c$. We also consider anomalous dimensions for fields, scalar mass squared, and a class of dimension-3 operators. Contrary to previous studies, we take into account possible mixing of the latter and compute eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix. Further, we investigate the size of the conformal window in the Veneziano limit and its dependence on $N_c$.</description>

Abstract: One of the main applications of resurgence in physics is the decoding of nonperturbative effects through large order relations. These relations connect perturbative asymptotic expansions of observables to expansions around other saddle points. Together, this data is unified in transseries that describe the nonperturbative structure. It is known that large order relations themselves also take the form of transseries. We study these large order transseries, uncover an interesting underlying geometry that we call the `Borel cylinder', and show that large order transseries in turn are resurgent -- that is: their nonperturbative sectors `know about each other' through Borel residues that are essentially equal to those of the original transseries. We show that with an appropriate resummation prescription, large order relations are often exact: they can be used to exactly compute perturbative coefficients -- not just their large order growth. Finally, we argue that Stokes phenomenon plays an important role for large order relations, for example if we want to extend the discrete index of the perturbative coefficients to arbitrary complex values.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Gravitational neutrino reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite having important cosmological implications, the reheating phase is believed to play a crucial role in cosmology and particle physics model building. Conventionally, the model of reheating with an arbitrary coupling of inflaton to massless fields naturally lacks precise prediction and hence difficult to verify through observation. In this paper, we propose a simple and natural reheating mechanism where the particle physics model, namely the Type-I seesaw is shown to play a major role in the entire reheating process where inflaton is coupled with all the fields only gravitationally. Besides successfully resolving the well-known neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry problems, this scenario offers successful reheating, predicts distinct primordial gravitational wave spectrum and non-vanishing lowest active neutrino mass. Our novel mechanism opens up a new avenue of integrating particle physics and cosmology in the context of reheating.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in 1-Parameter New General Relativity and their phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in 1-parameter New General Relativity (NGR), a specific theory in teleparallel gravity which is constructed from the three possible quadratic scalars obtained from torsion with arbitrary coefficients satisfying the requirements for the absence of ghosts. In this class of modified theories of gravity, the observable effects of gravity result from the torsion rather than the curvature of the spacetime. Unlike in GR, where the fundamental quantity is the metric from which the Levi-Civita connection is derived, in teleparallel theories of gravity the fundamental variable is the tetrad, from which one constructs the metric and the teleparallel connection. We consider the most general tetrad for spherical symmetry and we derive the corresponding field equations. Under adequate assumptions, we find three different branches of vacuum solutions and discuss their associated phenomenology. In particular, we analyze the photon sphere, the classical tests of GR such as the light deflection, the Shapiro delay, and the perihelion shift, and also the Komar mass, while providing a detailed comparison with their Schwarzschild spacetime counterparts. Finally, we analyze how the observational imprints from accretion disks and shadows are affected in comparison with their GR counterparts, and conclude that the free parameters of the model might induce additional attractive or repulsive effects to the propagation of photons, depending on their values.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for non-local spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes with Yukawa Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study derives a novel family of charged black hole solutions featuring short- and long-range modifications. These ones are achieved through a Yukawa-like gravitational potential modification and a nonsingular electric potential incorporation. The short-range corrections encode quantum gravity effects, while the long-range adjustments simulate gravitational effects akin to those attributed to dark matter. Our investigation reveals that the total mass of the black hole undergoes corrections owing to the apparent presence of dark matter mass and the self-adjusted electric charge mass. Two distinct solutions are discussed: a regular black hole solution characterizing small black holes, where quantum effects play a crucial role, and a second solution portraying large black holes at considerable distances, where the significance of Yukawa corrections comes into play. Notably, these long-range corrections contribute to an increase in the total mass and hold particular interest as they can emulate the role of dark matter. Finally, we explore the phenomenological aspects of the black hole. Specifically, we examine the influence of electric charge and Yukawa parameters on thermodynamic quantities, the quasinormal modes for the charged scalar perturbations as well as for the vector perturbations, analysis of the geodesics of light/massive particles, and the accretion of matter onto the charged black hole solution.</description>

      <title>On geometrical origin of Kodama vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that warped product spacetimes such as spherically symmetric ones admit the Kodama vector. This vector provides a locally conserved current made by contraction of the Einstein tensor, even though there is no Killing vector. In addition, a quasilocal mass, Birkhoff's theorem and various properties are closely related to the Kodama vector. Recently, it is shown that the notion of the Kodama vector can be extended to three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes even if the spacetimes are not warped product. This implies that warped product may not be a necessary condition for a spacetime to admit the Kodama vector. We show properties of the Kodama vector originate from the conformal Killing-Yano two-form. In particular, the well-known spacetimes that admit the Kodama vector have a closed conformal Killing-Yano two-form. Furthermore, we show the Kodama vector provides local conserved currents for each order of the Lovelock tensor as well as the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey on the Strominger system and a geometric flow known as the anomaly flow. We will discuss various aspects of non-K\"ahler geometry on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Along the way, we discuss balanced metrics and balanced classes, the Aeppli cohomology class associated to a solution to the Strominger system, the equations of motion of heterotic supergravity, and a version of Ricci flow in this special geometry.</description>

      <title>Conformally related vacuum gravitational waves, and their symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>
