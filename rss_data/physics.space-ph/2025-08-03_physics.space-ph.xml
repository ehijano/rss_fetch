      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>

      <title>Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Prompt identification of solar wind stream interaction regions from Survey Burst 1 Mode observations of the Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying stream interaction regions (SIRs), from their inception and the dynamics of their development, can provide insight into solar-terrestrial connections. Some in-situ instruments on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) space mission are designed to measure solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field parameters along the flight path. These instruments are ideal for studying the dynamics of SIR evolution at heliocentric distances of 0.28-1.0 AU and with changes in heliolatitude of 0^{\circ} - 33^{\circ}. To address the challenges of promptly identifying SIRs and predicting their arrival time on Earth, we consider using trigger events from the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW)/SolO instrument, which are transmitted in telemetry data packages. We suggest that multiple activations of the trigger mode (SBM1 mode) in the RPW instrument over an interval of up to four hours may reflect the fine structure of large-scale events in SW. Such events can serve as markers for the spacecraft's location within the SIR. In this regard, the 2023 analysis revealed that multiple activations of the SBM1 trigger mode throughout the day accounted for more than 50\% of the total number of days for which such events were recorded. Of this number, 63\% were events when the trigger algorithm was prompted repeatedly within a time interval of up to four hours. A comparison of the registration times of SBM1 trigger events with the SW parameters obtained from the SWA-PAS and MAG instruments showed that repeated activations of the trigger algorithm occurred at the stream interface surface when a high-speed SW stream and a formed compression region were present.</description>

      <title>Prototype Development and Calibration of the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star with its unprecedented sensitivity to solar flare polarization. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation.
  In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a 1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source. We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.</description>

      <title>Study of the HV power supply modules for the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification and Reconstruction in Rotating Astrophysical Plasmas: Verifying the Roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Dynamo Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system relevant to astrophysical environments. These coefficients were derived using three different approaches based on the large-scale magnetic field $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$, turbulent velocity $\mathbf{u}$, and turbulent magnetic field $\mathbf{b}$, yielding $\alpha_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, and $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$. Using raw data from direct numerical simulations (DNS), we constructed the magnetic induction equation incorporating the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients. We then reproduced the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field and compared the results with the DNS data. In the kinematic regime, where $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ is weak, all models exhibit good agreement with the DNS results. However, in the nonlinear regime, the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field, reproduced using $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, deviates from the DNS and exhibits unbounded growth. To address this discrepancy, we added $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$, which represents the contribution of turbulent magnetic fields, to $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$. This addition suppresses the divergent growth of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ in the nonlinear regime. We then assessed the actual influence of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the evolution of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ by applying weighted combinations of the two coefficients. Our results show that magnetic $\beta$ diffusion plays a dominant role throughout the entire process. In contrast, the $\alpha$ effect is minor in the kinematic regime but becomes essential for sustaining the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field in the nonlinear regime. We also discussed the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this behavior.</description>
