      <title>Brownian simulations for fracture of star polymer phantom networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a recent simulation study [Masubuchi et al., Macromolecules, 56, 9359 (2023)], the cycle rank plays a significant role in determining the fracture characteristics of network polymers. However, the study only considered energy-minimized networks without the effects of thermal agitation. We conducted Brownian dynamics simulations at various stretch rates to address this gap. The results showed that even with Brownian motion, the strain and stress at the break obtained for different node functionalities and conversion ratios exhibited master curves if plotted against cycle rank. These master curves were dependent on the strain rate, with the curves tending to approach those observed in energy-minimized simulations as the strain rate decreased, even though the fracture process was affected by the competition against Brownian motion, elongation, and bond degradation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of charged nanotubes self-assembly during evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits is required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee-ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Rotation-Beating dynamics of a driven flexible filament: role of motor protein properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used numerical simulations to investigate how the properties of motor proteins control the dynamical behavior of a driven flexible filament. The filament is pinned at one end and positioned on top of a patch of anchored motor proteins, a setup commonly referred to as a spiral gliding assay. In nature, there is a variety of motor proteins with different properties. In this study, we have investigated the role of detachment rate, detachment force, stall force, and unloaded speed of motors on the dynamical behavior of the filament. We found that this system generally can show three different regimes: 1) Fluctuation, where the filament undergoes random fluctuations because the motors are unable to bend it. 2) Rotation, in which the filament bends and then moves continuously in one direction. 3) Beating, where the filament's direction of rotation changes over time. We found that the transition between fluctuation and rotation occurs when motors exert a force sufficient to buckle the filament. The threshold force coincides to the second buckling mode of a filament undergoing a continuously distributed load. Moreover, we showed that when motors near the pining point work close to their stall force, they get stuck and act as a second pin, leading to the beating regime.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion of a single microparticle partially engulfed by a giant lipid vesicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interactions between biomimetic membranes and micron-sized particles serves as a fundamental cornerstone for understanding various biological processes. Here, we aim at controlling the engulfment of microparticles in absence of any externally applied force. We investigate systems involving particles and lipid vesicles, where interactions are primarily mediated by electrostatics. Our attention is directed towards dissipative phenomena at the micron and nano scales occurring between a vesicle membrane and a particle, highlighting the influence of the particle penetration depth and the impact of substructures on particle friction. Our work is complemented by hydrodynamic simulations considering the impacts of the shape of the membrane wrapping the particle and the water gap separating the lipid bilayer membrane and the particle on the translational particle drag. Lastly, we explore a system of aqueous microdroplets in oil, stabilized by a single lipid layer and compare the friction experienced by a particle in contact with this monolayer to the friction observed for particles wrapped by lipid bilayers. Surprisingly, the particle drag is higher on the lipid monolayer than the bilayer, which can be explained by introducing a drag contribution due to the partial wetting dynamics of the particle at the monolayer interface.</description>

      <title>Flat-cupped transition in freezing drop impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the freezing of alkane drops impacted on a liquid bath. More specifically, for drops of hexadecane and tetradecane on brine, we found a morphological transition of the solid between a flat disk and a cupped shape. We show that this transition depends mainly on melting temperature and thermal shock, and varies weakly with impact velocity. We observed that the impact dynamics does not depend on the thermal shock before the drop starts to solid ify, which allows a rationalization of the solid size by models established for impact without phase change. Finally, we show that the relevant timescale setting the onset of solidification is associated with the formation of a thin solid layer between the drop and the bath, a timescale much shorter than the total solidification time. These findings offer the possibility to collapse the data for both liquids in a single phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Morpho-mechanics of pressurized cellular sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everyday experience shows that cellular sheets are stiffened by the presence of a pressurized gas: from bicycle inner tubes to bubble wrap, the presence of an internal pressure increases the stiffness of otherwise floppy structures. The same is true of plants, with turgor pressure (due to the presence of water) taking the place of gas pressure; indeed, in the absence of water, many plants wilt. However, the mechanical basis of this stiffening is somewhat opaque: simple attempts to rationalize it suggest that the stiffness should be independent of the pressure, at odds with everyday experience. Here, we study the mechanics of sheets that are a single cell thick and show how a pressure-dependent bending stiffness may arise. Our model rationalizes observations of turgor-driven shrinkage in plant cells and also suggests that turgor is unlikely to provide significant structural support in many monolayer leaves, such as those found in mosses. However, for such systems, turgor does provide a way to control leaf shape, in accordance with observations of curling upon drying of moss leaves. Guided by our results, we also present a biomimetic actuator that un-curls upon pressurization.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-accuracy tradeoffs in autonomous control of smart active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of motility control by smart agents offers a promising platform for systematically exploring the fundamental physical constraints underlying the functioning of bio-inspired micro-machines operating far from equilibrium. Here, we address the question of the energy cost required for a self-steering active agent to localise itself within a specific region of space or follow a pre-defined trajectory under the influence of fluctuations and external flows. Building on a stochastic thermodynamic formulation of the problem, we derive a generic relationship between dissipation and localisation accuracy, which reveals a fundamental dissipation-accuracy tradeoff constraining the agent's performance. In addition, we illustrate how our framework enables the derivation of optimal steering policies that achieve localisation at minimum energy expenditure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of self-assembly of quasicrystalline structures through reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose reinforcement learning to control the dynamical self-assembly of the dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) from patchy particles. The patchy particles have anisotropic interactions with other particles and form DDQC. However, their structures at steady states are significantly influenced by the kinetic pathways of their structural formation. We estimate the best policy of temperature control trained by the Q-learning method and demonstrate that we can generate DDQC with few defects using the estimated policy. It is found that reinforcement learning autonomously discovers a characteristic temperature at which structural fluctuations enhance the chance of forming a globally stable state. The estimated policy guides the system toward the characteristic temperature to assist the formation of DDQC. We also illustrate the performance of RL when the target is metastable or unstable. To clarify the success of the learning, we analyse a simple model describing the kinetics of structural changes through the motion in a triple-well potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate both ensemble and time-averaged mean-squared displacements of particles in a polydisperse granular system in a homogeneous cooling state. The system contains an arbitrary number of species of different sizes and masses. The collisions between granular particles are described in terms of the models both of constant and time-dependent restitution coefficients. In our study, we use a powerful low-rank algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of highly polydisperse granular systems. The Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results.</description>

      <title>A simple mathematical theory for Simple Volatile Memristors and their spiking circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In pursuit of neuromorphic (brain-inspired) devices, memristors (memory-resistors) have emerged as effective components for emulating neuronal circuitry. Here we formally define a class of Simple Volatile Memristors (SVMs) based on a simple conductance equation of motion from which we build a simple mathematical theory on the dynamics of isolated SVMs and SVM-based spiking circuits. Notably, SVMs include various fluidic iontronic devices that have recently garnered significant interest due to their unique quality of operating within the same medium as the brain. Specifically we show that symmetric SVMs produce non self-crossing current-voltage hysteresis loops, while asymmetric SVMs produce self-crossing loops. Additionally, we derive a general expression for the enclosed area in a loop, providing a relation between the voltage frequency and the SVM memory timescale. These general results are shown to materialise in physical finite-element calculations of microfluidic memristors. An SVM-based circuit has been proposed that exhibits all-or-none and tonic neuronal spiking. We generalise and analyse this spiking circuit, characterising it as a two-dimensional dynamical system. Moreover, we demonstrate that stochastic effects can induce novel neuronal firing modes absent in the deterministic case. Through our analysis, the circuit dynamics are well understood, while retaining its explicit link with the physically plausible underlying system.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Transport through Evolving Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

      <title>Coat stiffening can explain invagination of clathrin-coated membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main pathway used by eukaryotic cells to take up extracellular material, but the dominant physical mechanisms driving this process are still elusive. Recently several high-resolution imaging techniques have been used on different cell lines to measure the geometrical properties of clathrin-coated pits over their whole lifetime. Here we first show that the combination of all datasets with the recently introduced cooperative curvature model defines a consensus pathway, which is characterized by a flat to-curved transition at finite area, followed by linear growth and subsequent saturation of curvature. We then apply an energetic model for the composite of plasma membrane and clathrin coat to this consensus pathway to show that the dominant mechanism for invagination could be coat stiffening, which might originate from cooperative interactions between the different clathrin molecules and progressively drives the system towards its intrinsic curvature. Our theory predicts that two length scales determine the invagination pathway, namely the patch size at which the flat-to-curved transition occurs and the final pit radius.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Multicomponent Coexistence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multicomponent phase separation is a routine occurrence in both living and synthetic systems. Thermodynamics provides a straightforward path to determine the phase boundaries that characterize these transitions for systems at equilibrium. The prevalence of phase separation in complex systems outside the confines of equilibrium motivates the need for a genuinely nonequilibrium theory of multicomponent phase coexistence. Here, we develop a mechanical theory for coexistence that casts coexistence criteria into the familiar form of equality of state functions. Our theory generalizes traditional equilibrium notions such as the species chemical potential and thermodynamic pressure to systems out of equilibrium. Crucially, while these notions may not be identifiable for all nonequilibrium systems, we numerically verify their existence for a variety of systems by introducing the phenomenological Multicomponent Active Model B+. Our work establishes an initial framework for understanding multicomponent coexistence that we hope can serve as the basis for a comprehensive theory for high-dimensional nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>
