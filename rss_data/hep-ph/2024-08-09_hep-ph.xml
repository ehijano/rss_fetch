      <title>Loosely Bound Composite Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate loosely bound composite states made of dark matter, where the binding energy for constituent particles is less than the constituent mass. We focus on models of nuclear and molecular dark matter, where constituents are separated by length scales larger than the inverse constituent mass, just like nuclei and atoms in the Standard Model. The cosmology, structure, and interactions at underground experiments are described. We find that loosely bound composites can have a very large cross section for scattering with nuclei that scales with nucleon number like $\sim A^4$. For some couplings, these composites produce extremely soft ($\ll$ keV) individual atomic recoils while depositing a large amount of total recoil energy ($\gg$ keV) in a single passage through a detector, implying an interesting new class of signatures for low threshold direct detection.</description>

      <title>Three-Loop OPE Wilson Coefficients of Dimension-Four Operators for (Axial-)Vector and (Pseudo-)Scalar Current Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the three-loop Wilson coefficients of all physically relevant dimension-four operators, i.e. $G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a,\mu\nu}$, $m_i\bar q_j q_j$ and $m_i m_j m_k^2$, in the short-distance expansion of the time-ordered product of a pair of gauge-singlet vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. The results are given for a general non-Abelian gauge theory with arbitrary (compact semi-simple) gauge group and $n_f$ light fermion flavors (quarks) in a common arbitrary representation of the gauge group, which includes QCD as a special case. In particular, we allow for arbitrary flavor contents of each of the currents. For the axial-vector current the included contributions from so-called singlet diagrams are consistent with the one-loop axial anomaly.</description>

      <title>New Physics at Tera-$Z$: Precision Renormalised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the power of a Tera-$Z$ run at FCC-ee for indirectly detecting or constraining heavy new physics. Our main finding is that nearly every new particle which matches at tree level to dimension-six operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) affects electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) at either tree level or via one loop renormalisation group (RG) running. This is true almost regardless of the structure of couplings to the Standard Model; just a handful of exceptions are identified which can produce zeroes in the EWPO RG equations. Under simple flavour assumptions, we perform fits of each state to projected FCC-ee $Z$ pole measurements, showing that all scenarios can be tested at the TeV scale or better, with many projected exclusions reaching tens of TeV. Tera-$Z$ is argued to provide an almost inescapable probe of heavy new physics.</description>

      <title>New results in the CTEQ-TEA global analysis of parton distributions in the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes the latest developments in the CTEQ-TEA global analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleon. The focus is on recent NNLO fits to high-precision LHC data at 8 and 13 TeV, including Drell-Yan, jet, and top-quark pair production, pursued on the way toward the release of the new generation of CTEQ-TEA general-purpose PDFs. The report also discusses advancements in statistical and numerical methods for PDF determination and uncertainty quantification, highlighting the importance of robust and replicable uncertainties for high-stakes observables. Additionally, it covers phenomenological studies related to PDF determination, such as the interplay of experimental constraints, exploration of correlations between high-$x$ nucleon sea and low-energy parity-violating measurements, fitted charm in the nucleon, the photon PDF in the neutron, and simultaneous SMEFT-PDF analyses.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute example rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes that go beyond traditional energy exchange.
  Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions.
  We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the C$\nu$B, dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates we find can be quite sizable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass.
  Using the Lindblad formalism for open quantum systems, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in counterpropagating laser pulses: Identifying volume factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative process of vacuum pair production in a combination of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses of a finite spatial extent. By means of the locally-constant field approximation (LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding four-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for simplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well justified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing electromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate that at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict the actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume factors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions for these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle yield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the four-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $5\%$. The explicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of the approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number of pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing complicated numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Axions, Photons and Physics Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we re-assess some aspects of axionic electrodynamics by coupling non-linear electromagnetic effects to axion physics. We present a number of motivations to justify the coupling of the axion to the photon in terms of a general non-linear extension of the electromagnetic sector. Our emphasis in the paper relies on the investigation of the constitutive permittivity and permeability tensors, for which the axion contribution introduces a dependence on the frequency and wave vector of the propagating radiation. Also, we point out how the axion mass and the axion-photon coupling constant contribute to a dispersive behavior of the electromagnetic waves, in contrast to what happens in the case of non-linear extensions, when effective refractive indices appear which depend only on the direction of the propagation with respect to the external fields. The axion changes this picture by yielding refractive indices with dependence on the wavelength. We apply our results to the special case of the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics and we show that it becomes birefringent whenever the axion is coupled. We also include in our analysis the Lorentz violation phenomenon through a Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, where we investigate the influence of this sector on the dispersion relations, and consequently, on the optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Predicting X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energy with PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of X(2370) glueball-like particle production in $e^+e^-$ collisions, we search its production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with a parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and final hadronic state (FHS) are consecutively simulated and recorded. The X(2370) glueball- or tetraquark-state is then, respectively, recombined by two gluons or four quarks $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS using the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The X(2370) molecular-state is recombined by the baryon-antibaryon of $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ or $\Sigma$-$\bar{\Sigma}$, or by three mesons of $\pi^+\pi^{-}\eta'$, $K^+K^-\eta'$, or $K_S^0K_S^0\eta'$ in the FHS using DCPC model. Significant discrepancies in the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$) distributions among the X(2370) glueball-, tetraquark-, and molecular-state are observed. Thus both of $p_{\rm T}$ and $y$ distributions could serve as valuable criteria identifying different states of the X(2370). We strongly suggest the experimental measurement of the X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <title>On convergence properties of GPD expansion through Mellin/conformal moments and orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of reconstructing the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We provide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal summation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and specify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on the conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and subsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x&gt;\xi$. Since experimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double or even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and Wilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the multiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via analytical continuations of integer summation indices.</description>

      <title>Production mechanism of the hidden charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm pentaquark states using an off-shell coupled-channel formalism involving heavy meson and singly heavy baryon scattering. Our approach utilizes an effective Lagrangian to construct the kernel amplitudes, which respect both heavy quark symmetry and hidden local symmetry. After solving the coupled integral equations, we obtain the transition amplitudes for $J/\psi N$ scattering and various heavy meson and singly heavy baryon scattering processes. We identify seven distinct peaks related to molecular states of heavy mesons $\bar{D}$ ($\bar{D}^*$) and singly heavy baryons $\Sigma_c$ ($\Sigma_c^*$). Four of these peaks can be associated with the known $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states: $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$. We predict two additional resonances with masses around 4.5 GeV, which we interpret as $\overline{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ molecular states, and identify one cusp structure. Additionally, we predict two $P$-wave pentaquark states with positive parity, which may be candidates for genuine pentaquark configurations. Notably, these pentaquark states undergo significant modifications in the $J/\psi N$ elastic channel, with some even disappearing due to interference from the positive parity channel. The present investigation may provide insight into the absence of pentaquark states in $J/\psi$ photoproduction observed by the GlueX collaboration.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Beyond-Standard Model Effects in Neutrino Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically assess the DUNE experiment's ability to distinguish between various beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses pair combinations. For a pair comparison, we evaluate the statistical separation, where one hypothesis plays the role of the true signal while the other corresponds to the test signal. The beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses under scrutiny include neutrino decay (invisible and visible), non-standard interactions, quantum decoherence, and the violation of the equivalence principle. When taken as the true model, we found that either quantum decoherence or the violation of the equivalence principle are the easiest to differentiate compared to the rest of the hypotheses. Additionally, from our statistical test, we investigate potential discrepancies between the measured CP-violation phase $\delta_{CP}$ relative to its true value, which could occur for a given comparison. In our analysis, we will take the true values of $\delta_{CP}$ as $-90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Notably, even in cases where the beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses scenarios are statistically indistinguishable, the measured value can exhibit significant deviations from its true value.</description>

      <title>Resummation of threshold double logarithms in hadroproduction of heavy quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resum threshold double logarithms that appear in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium. This resolves the catastrophic failure of fixed-order perturbation theory where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse momentum can turn negative due to large radiative corrections. We find that resummation is imperative for describing measured prompt production rates of $J/\psi$ at large transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV using hydrodynamic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have implemented the 3+1 dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamics model with TRENTO-3D initial conditions to investigate the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along the beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV. Following our previous theoretical framework based on quantum kinetic theory, we consider three different scenarios: $\Lambda$ equilibrium, $s$ quark equilibrium, and iso-thermal equilibrium scenarios. We have computed the second Fourier sine coefficients of spin polarization along the beam direction, denoted as $\left\langle P_{z} \sin 2(\phi_{p} - \Psi_{2}) \right\rangle$, with $\phi_p$ being the azimuthal angle relative to the second-order event plane $\Psi_{2}$, as functions of multiplicity and transverse momentum in the three scenarios. Additionally, we have also computed the spin polarization along the beam direction, $P_{z}$, as a function of the azimuthal angle. We find that the spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity always provides an opposite contribution compared to the shear-induced polarization in p+Pb collisions. The total spin polarization computed by the current hydrodynamic model disagrees with the data measured by LHC-CMS experiments. Our findings imply that other non-flow effects may play a crucial role in p+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and isothermal compressibility in a magnetized quark matter with anomalous magnetic moment of quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the characteristics of quark matter under the influence of a background magnetic field with anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of quarks at finite temperature and quark chemical potential in the framework of Polyakov loop extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. In presence of a magnetic field, the speed of sound and isothermal compressibility become anisotropic with respect to the direction of the background magnetic field, splitting into parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the magnetic field. Though the qualitative nature of parallel and perpendicular components of squared speed of sound appear similar, they differ in magnitude at lower values of temperature. The parallel and perpendicular components of isothermal compressibility decrease with increasing temperature, indicating a trend towards increased incompressible strongly interacting matter. On inclusion of the AMM of quarks, the perpendicular component of isothermal compressibility becomes greater than the parallel component. Additionally, we investigate the quark number susceptibility normalized by its value at zero magnetic field, which may indicate the presence of magnetic fields in the system.</description>

      <title>Global Fits in the Supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a supersymmetric extension of the SM with Higgs triplets in the scalar sector. We begin with a review of the SM, particularly the Higgs mechanism. In the SM, the Higgs mechanism requires the presence of a complex Higgs doublet to break the electroweak symmetry and endow particles with a mass; this process is called Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. Although this is the simplest possibility, higher scalar representations may also contribute to the EWSB. The extent to which these higher representations contribute to EWSB is constrained by precise measurements of the $rho$ parameter. The model must predict $\rho=1$ at tree level. It is a fortuitous circumstance that simple doublet representations satisfy this requirement exactly. The underlying reason is that models with doublets satisfy an accidental custodial symmetry. Therefore, one can add any number of scalar doublets and still satisfy this experimental constraint. For higher representations, it is a bit trickier to maintain the custodial symmetry. We study in this work a supersymmetric model that incorporates triplet representations and satisfies the custodial symmetry. The non-supersymmetric Gorgi-Machacek model is one example of a custodial invariant model of SSB with Higgs triplets. However, the GM model has a fine-tuning problem beyond that of the SM. The solution to both issues is the Supersymmetric Custodial Triplet Model. The supersymmetric GM model arises as a low energy limit of the SCTM. It is this model that we study here. We make use of public code, GMCalc and HiggsTools, to perform global fits to the parameters of this model and obtain limits on model parameters at the $95%$ confidence level. For these hypothetical scalars, we identify the dominant decay channels and extract bounds on their branching ratios. We also examine the possible presence of a 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the SGM.</description>

      <title>Dirac Algebra Formalism for Two Higgs Doublet Models: the One-Loop Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel covariant bilinear formalism for the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) which utilises the Dirac algebra associated with the SL(2,C) group that acts on the scalar doublet field space. This Dirac-algebra approach enables us to obtain a fully O(1,3)-covariant and IR-safe expression for the one-loop effective potential. We illustrate how the formalism can be used to evaluate the breaking of global symmetries of the 2HDM potential by loop effects, in a field-reparameterisation invariant manner.</description>

      <title>Resonant conversion of axion dark radiation into terahertz electromagnetic radiation in a neutron star magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the strong magnetic field of a neutron star's magnetosphere, axions coupled to electromagnetism develop a nonzero probability to convert into photons. Past studies have revealed that the axion-photon conversion can be resonantly enhanced. We recognize that the axion-photon resonance admits two parametrically distinct resonant solutions, which we call the mass-matched resonance and the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance. The mass-matched resonance occurs at a point in the magnetosphere where the radially-varying plasma frequency crosses the axion mass $\omega_\mathrm{pl} \approx m_a$. The Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance occurs where the axion energy satisfies $\omega \approx (2 \omega_\mathrm{pl}^2 / 7 g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} \bar{B}^2 )^{1/2}$. This second resonance is made possible though the strong background magnetic field $\bar{B}$ as well as the nonzero Euler-Heisenberg four-photon self interaction, which has the coupling $g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} = 8 \alpha^2 / 45 m_e^4$. We study the resonant conversion of relativistic axion dark radiation into photons via the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance, and we calculate the expected electromagnetic radiation assuming different values for the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and different amplitudes for the axion flux onto the neutron star $\Phi_a$. We briefly discuss several possible sources of axion dark radiation. Achieving a sufficiently strong axion flux to induce a detectable electromagnetic signal seems unlikely.</description>

      <title>Interference Resurrection of the $\tau$ Dipole through Quantum Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicity selection rules can defy the expectation that the leading contributions from Standard Model Effective Field Theory operators occur at dimension 6, potentially reducing sensitivity to new physics scenarios. This paper investigates how spin correlations can restore ("resurrect") the interference contributions of the $\tau$ lepton's anomalous dipole moment. We first illustrate the mechanism for this interference restoration using a simple quantum mechanical example. We then calculate the sensitivity of these spin correlations to new physics. Additionally, we compute quantum information observables, namely measures of entanglement, Bell inequality violation, and the irreducible quantum uncertainty of the $\tau\tau$ state. Our findings show that spin correlation observables outperform both the cross-section and quantum information observables, by providing greater sensitivity to new physics and preserving information about $CP$ violation.</description>

      <title>Effective K\"ahler and auxiliary field potentials for chiral superfield models at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I obtain the effective K\"ahler potential at three-loop order for a general renormalizable supersymmetric theory containing only chiral supermultiplets. The three-loop contribution is remarkably simple, consisting of only four terms involving three distinct renormalized master integrals. In the case of the Wess-Zumino model with a single chiral superfield, I also obtain the effective auxiliary field potential at three-loop order, extending previous results at one-loop order. The method used is inferential, relying on existing knowledge of the ordinary scalar effective potential.</description>

      <title>Axion production via trapped misalignment from Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry does not need to be exact, and even a tiny source of PQ breaking not aligned with the QCD anomaly might have significant phenomenological implications. In this study, we examine the effects of a general class of PQ-breaking operators on the axion cosmological production via misalignment, focussing on both temperature-dependent and independent PQ-breaking potentials. In particular, we show that a variant of the trapped misalignment mechanism can delay the onset of axion oscillation, leading to an axion dark matter window with $m_a \gg 10^{-5}$ eV. This scenario is testable through various experimental approaches, including standard axion haloscopes and helioscopes, as well as searches for electric dipole moments and axion-mediated forces.</description>

      <title>Parity-breaking galaxy 4-point function from lensing by chiral gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing electromagnetic transport models.</description>

      <title>Holographic Gubser flow: A combined analytic and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an evolution with cylindrical and boost symmetries, which can be best studied by mapping the future wedge of Minkowski space (R$^{3,1}$) to dS$_3$ $\times$ $\mathbb{R}$ in a conformal relativistic theory. Here, we sharpen our previous analytic results and validate them via the first numerical exploration of the Gubser flow in a holographic conformal field theory.
  Remarkably, the leading generic behavior at large de Sitter time is free-streaming in transverse directions and the sub-leading behavior is that of a color glass condensate. We also show that Gubser flow can be smoothly glued to the vacuum outside the future Minkowski wedge generically given that the energy density vanishes faster than any power when extrapolated to early proper time or to large distances from the central axis. We find that at intermediate times the ratio of both the transverse and longitudinal pressures to the energy density converge approximately to a fixed point which is hydrodynamic only for large initial energy densities. We argue that our results suggest that the Gubser flow is better applied to collective behavior in jets rather than the full medium in the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions and can reveal new clues to the mechanism of confinement.</description>

      <title>From squared amplitudes to energy correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading order $N$-point energy correlators of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the limit where the $N$ detectors are collinear can be expressed as an integral of the $1\to N$ splitting function, which is given by the $(N{+}3)$-point squared super-amplitudes at tree level. This provides yet another example that the integrand of certain physical observable -- $N$-point energy correlator -- is computed by the canonical form of a positive geometry -- the (tree-level) "squared amplituhedron". By extracting such squared amplitudes from the $f$-graph construction, we compute the integrand of energy correlators up to $N=11$ and reveal new structures to all $N$; we also show important properties of the integrand such as soft and multi-collinear limits. Finally, we take a first look at integrations by studying possible residues of the integrand: our analysis shows that while this gives prefactors in front of multiple polylogarithm functions of $N=3,4$, the first unknown case of $N=5$ already involves elliptic polylogarithmic functions with many distinct elliptic curves, and more complicated curves and higher-dimensional varieties appear for $N&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to exist, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of a regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ inevitably raises $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like degrees of freedom generally interact with fermions through a shift symmetric coupling. As a consequence, a time-dependent axion will lead to the generation of fermions by amplifying their vacuum fluctuations. We provide the formulae that allow one to determine the spectra of produced fermions in a generic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe with flat spatial slices. Then we derive simple approximate formulae for the spectra of the produced fermions, as a function of the model parameters, in the specific cases of a radiation- and a matter-dominated Universe, in the regime in which the backreaction of the produced fermions on the axionic background can be neglected.</description>

Abstract: We study Polchinski's "fermion-rotor system" as an accurate description of charged Weyl fermions scattering on a magnetic monopole core in the limit of zero gauge coupling. Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to fractional particle numbers ("semitons"). By direct calculations we show those semitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite fermion-rotor operators interpolating the "forbidden" states, effectively "recovering" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave. Non-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.</description>

Abstract: We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly available gamma-ray data slightly off-axis from this region. This background model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an application, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tests of models for new physics appearing in neutrino experiments often involve global fits to a quantum mechanical effect called neutrino oscillations. This paper introduces students to methods commonly used in these global fits starting from an understanding of more conventional fitting methods using log-likelihood and $\chi^2$ minimization. Specifically, we discuss how the $\Delta\chi^2$, which compares the $\chi^2$ of the fit with the new physics to the $\chi^2$ of the Standard Model prediction, is often interpreted using Wilks's theorem. This paper uses toy models to explore the properties of $\Delta\chi^2$ as a test statistic for oscillating functions. The statistics of such models are shown to deviate from Wilks's theorem. Tests for new physics also often examine data subsets for "tension" called the "parameter goodness of fit". In this paper, we explain this approach and use toy models to examine the validity of the probabilities from this test also. Although we have chosen a specific scenario -- neutrino oscillations -- to illustrate important points, students should keep in mind that these points are widely applicable when fitting multiple data sets to complex functions.</description>

Abstract: The nuclear reaction network within the interior of the Sun is an efficient MeV physics factory, and can produce long-lived particles generic to dark sector models. In this work we consider the sensitivity of satellite instruments, primarily the RHESSI Spectrometer, that observe the Quiet Sun in the MeV regime where backgrounds are low. We find that Quiet Sun observations offer a powerful and complementary probe in regions of parameter space where the long-lived particle decay length is longer than the radius of the Sun, and shorter than the distance between the Sun and Earth. We comment on connections to recent model-building work on heavy neutral leptons coupled to neutrinos and high-quality axions from mirror symmetries.</description>

      <title>Listening for echo from the stimulated axion decay with the 21 CentiMeter Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that could solve the long-standing strong CP problem in particle physics and the dark matter mystery in the cosmos. Due to the stimulation of the ambient photons, the axion dark matter decay into photons is significantly enhanced so that its echo signal could be detected by terrestrial telescopes. As a pathfinder, we study the expected sensitivity of searching for the axion dark matter in the mass range between $0.41$ and $1.6\mu\text{eV}$ with the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA). We aim to cover the whole 21CMA frequency range in two years by using a 1MW emitter. We find that the resulting sensitivity on the axion-photon coupling could surpass other existing limits by about one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations in neutrino gravitational scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study neutrino spin oscillations while the particles scatter off a rotating black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk which has both toroidal and poloidal components. Our calculation of the observed neutrino fluxes, accounting for spin oscillations, are based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a great number of incoming test particles using High Performance Parallel Computing. The obtained results significantly improve our previous findings. We briefly discuss the applications for the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Testing Leptogenesis and Seesaw using Long-lived Particle Searches in the $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the potential of using long-lived particle (LLP) searches for right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to test resonant leptogenesis and the seesaw mechanism. This is challenging if only RHNs are added to the Standard Model (SM), as naturally the active-sterile mixing strengths $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ are small, for 1 GeV $\lesssim M_N \lesssim 1000$ GeV. Instead, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge model, where a $Z^\prime$ gauge boson couples to fermions including the RHNs. During leptogenesis, this gauge coupling introduces scattering processes that washout the $B-L$ asymmetry. At colliders, it can lead to abundant production of RHNs which allows probing the associated seesaw mechanism using LLP searches. We find that LLP searches at the FCC-hh can test leptogenesis and the seesaw mechanism simultaneously, and probe the active-sterile mixing at or below the seesaw floor.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine leptogenesis scenario for resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrino is a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we examine the Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis scenario generating a large lepton asymmetry, which can induce the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism. We also revisit the numerical calculation of the SF mechanism and the constraints from current X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We find that the AD leptogenesis scenario can explain the production of sterile neutrino dark matter by incorporating a non-topological soliton with a lepton charge called L-ball. Finally, we discuss an enhancement of second-order gravitational waves at the L-ball decay and investigate the testability of our scenario with future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Trials Factor for Semi-Supervised NN Classifiers in Searches for Narrow Resonances at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate the model dependencies of searches for new narrow resonances at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), semi-supervised Neural Networks (NNs) can be used. Unlike fully supervised classifiers these models introduce an additional look-elsewhere effect in the process of optimising thresholds on the response distribution. We perform a frequentist study to quantify this effect, in the form of a trials factor. As an example, we consider simulated $Z\gamma$ data to perform narrow resonance searches using semi-supervised NN classifiers. The results from this analysis provide substantiation that the look-elsewhere effect induced by the semi-supervised NN is under control.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Group Improved Resummation of Super-Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new strategy is presented for systematically treating super-leading logarithmic contributions including higher-order Glauber exchanges for non-global LHC observables in renormalization-group (RG) improved perturbation theory. This represents an important improvement over previous approaches, as it allows for the consistent inclusion of the scale dependence of the strong coupling, thereby providing more reliable estimates of the scale uncertainties in theoretical predictions. The key idea is to rearrange the relevant RG evolution operator in such a way that all double-logarithmic corrections are exponentiated from the outset. This forms the starting point for the first resummation of super-leading logarithms at leading order in RG-improved perturbation theory for arbitrary $2\to M$ scattering processes. Moreover, the asymptotic scaling of subleading logarithmic corrections from higher-order Glauber exchanges is determined, demonstrating their parametric suppression.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy Enhancement of Neutron-Antineutron Oscillation in Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the fermion oscillation in a degenerate environment. The direct consequence is introducing a Pauli blocking factor $1 - f_i$, where $f_i$ is the phase space distribution function, for each intermediate mass eigenstate during propagation. It is then much easier for a state with larger existing fraction or density to oscillate into other states with less degeneracy while the reversed process is not enhanced. This can significantly modify the oscillation behaviors. We apply this degenerate fermion oscillation to a concrete scenario of neutron-antineutron oscillation in neutron star. It turns out antineutrons receive a standing fraction to annihilate with the environmental neutrons. The subsequent neutron star heating can put an extremely stringent bound on the baryon number violating cross mass term between neutron and antineutron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino experiments utilize heavy nuclear targets to achieve high statistics neutrino-nucleus interaction event rate, which leads to systematic uncertainties in the oscillation parameters due to the nuclear effects and uncertainties in the cross-section. Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with the nucleus becomes crucial in determining the oscillation parameters with high precision. We investigate the uncertainty in quasi-elastic interaction due to nuclear effects by selecting exactly 1 proton, 0 pions, and any number of neutrons in the final state in DUNE and MicroBooNE detectors, and the effects on the neutrino oscillation in the DUNE detector. The calorimetric method with this selection can be used for accurate neutrino energy reconstruction in the quasi-elastic channel where the nuclear effects are inevitable.</description>

      <title>$T_{cc}$ in the Diabatic Diquark Model: Effects of $D^*D$ Isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $T_{cc}^+$ is an isoscalar 4-quark state with mass lying barely below the $D^{*+} D^0$ threshold, and several times further below the $D^{*0} D^+$ threshold. It allows both di-meson molecular and elementary diquark-antidiquark $(cc)(\bar u \bar d)$ substructures. The diabatic generalization of the adiabatic approximation within the Born-Oppenheimer formalism rigorously incorporates the mixing of such elementary eigenstates with states corresponding to two-particle thresholds. We examine the separate influence of the two $D^* \! D$ isospin channels and find that the influence of $D^{*+} D^0$ is larger than that of $D^{*0} D^+$ but not overwhelmingly so, and that $T_{cc}^+$ contains an $O(10\%)$ $(cc)(\bar u \bar d)$ component. We then explore the variation of these results if the isospin breaking between the di-meson thresholds is varied, and also the sensitivity of our results to variation of the mixing-potential parameters.</description>

      <title>Diphoton signals for the Georgi-Machacek scenario at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diphoton channel for exploring the Georgi-Machacek (GM) scenario containing scalar triplets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been identified as germane, and subjected to a detailed study. The scalar spectrum of the model, which imposes a custodial SU(2) on the potential, gets classified into a 5-plet, a 3-plet and two singlets under the custodial symmetry. While most attempts to probe or constrain the scenario at the LHC depend largely on signals of charged scalars, we point out that the custodial SU(2) singlet state H can have a substantial branching ratio (amounting to a few percent) into two photons. We carry out a detailed simulation of the resulting signal and the standard model backgrounds, obtaining the signal significance in different regions of the parameter space using the profile likelihood ratio method. Substantial regions of the GM parameter space is thus shown to be accessible to LHC studies, both at the high-luminosity run with $\int {\cal L} dt = 3000 fb^{-1}$, and also in Run-3 with $\int {\cal L} dt = 300 fb^{-1}$, even after folding in systematic errors. We have also demonstrated that a rather subtantial improvement in the signal significance is achieved by switching over from a cut-based analysis to one based on neural network.</description>

      <title>Explicit form for the most general Lorentz transformation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit formulae for the $4\times 4$ Lorentz transformation matrices corresponding to a pure boost and a pure three-dimensional rotation are very well-known. Significantly less well-known is the explicit formula for a general Lorentz transformation with arbitrary nonzero boost and rotation parameters. We revisit this more general formula by presenting two different derivations. The first derivation (which is somewhat simpler than previous ones appearing in the literature) evaluates the exponential of a $4\times 4$ real matrix $A$, where $A$ is a product of the diagonal matrix ${\rm diag}(+1, -1, -1, -1)$ and an arbitrary $4\times 4$ real antisymmetric matrix. The formula for $\exp A$ depends only on the eigenvalues of $A$ and makes use of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. The second derivation exploits the observation that the spinor product $\eta^\dagger\overline{\sigma}^{\lower3pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle \mu$}}\chi$ transforms as a Lorentz four-vector, where $\chi$ and $\eta$ are two-component spinors. The advantage of the latter derivation is that the corresponding formula for a general Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ reduces to the computation of the trace of a product of $2\times 2$ matrices. Both computations are shown to yield equivalent expressions for $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from an autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is referred to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei: charge distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei for a given set of effective operators mediating the violation of lepton flavor symmetry crucially depends on hadronic and nuclear matrix elements. In particular, the uncertainties inherent in this non-perturbative input limit the discriminating power that can be achieved among operators by studying different target isotopes. In order to quantify the associated uncertainties, as a first step, we go back to nuclear charge densities and propagate the uncertainties from electron scattering data for a range of isotopes relevant for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, including $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{48,50}$Ti, and $^{27}$Al. We provide as central results Fourier-Bessel expansions of the corresponding charge distributions with complete covariance matrices, accounting for Coulomb-distortion effects in a self-consistent manner throughout the calculation. As an application, we evaluate the overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion mediated by dipole operators. In combination with modern ab-initio methods, our results will allow for the evaluation of general $\mu\to e$ conversion rates with quantified uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these stellar-mass black holes.</description>
