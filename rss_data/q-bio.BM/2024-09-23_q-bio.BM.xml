      <title>PepINVENT: Generative peptide design beyond the natural amino acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides play a crucial role in the drug design and discovery whether as a therapeutic modality or a delivery agent. Non-natural amino acids (NNAAs) have been used to enhance the peptide properties from binding affinity, plasma stability to permeability. Incorporating novel NNAAs facilitates the design of more effective peptides with improved properties. The generative models used in the field, have focused on navigating the peptide sequence space. The sequence space is formed by combinations of a predefined set of amino acids. However, there is still a need for a tool to explore the peptide landscape beyond this enumerated space to unlock and effectively incorporate de novo design of new amino acids. To thoroughly explore the theoretical chemical space of the peptides, we present PepINVENT, a novel generative AI-based tool as an extension to the small molecule molecular design platform, REINVENT. PepINVENT navigates the vast space of natural and non-natural amino acids to propose valid, novel, and diverse peptide designs. The generative model can serve as a central tool for peptide-related tasks, as it was not trained on peptides with specific properties or topologies. The prior was trained to understand the granularity of peptides and to design amino acids for filling the masked positions within a peptide. PepINVENT coupled with reinforcement learning enables the goal-oriented design of peptides using its chemistry-informed generative capabilities. This study demonstrates PepINVENT's ability to explore the peptide space with unique and novel designs, and its capacity for property optimization in the context of therapeutically relevant peptides. Our tool can be employed for multi-parameter learning objectives, peptidomimetics, lead optimization, and variety of other tasks within the peptide domain.</description>

      <title>ChemEval: A Comprehensive Multi-Level Chemical Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at {\color{blue} \url{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/ChemEval}}.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</description>

      <title>Protein-Mamba: Biological Mamba Models for Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein function prediction is a pivotal task in drug discovery, significantly impacting the development of effective and safe therapeutics. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with the complexity and variability inherent in predicting protein functions, necessitating more sophisticated approaches. In this work, we introduce Protein-Mamba, a novel two-stage model that leverages both self-supervised learning and fine-tuning to improve protein function prediction. The pre-training stage allows the model to capture general chemical structures and relationships from large, unlabeled datasets, while the fine-tuning stage refines these insights using specific labeled datasets, resulting in superior prediction performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Protein-Mamba achieves competitive performance, compared with a couple of state-of-the-art methods across a range of protein function datasets. This model's ability to effectively utilize both unlabeled and labeled data highlights the potential of self-supervised learning in advancing protein function prediction and offers a promising direction for future research in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Symphony: Symmetry-Equivariant Point-Centered Spherical Harmonics for 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Symphony, an $E(3)$-equivariant autoregressive generative model for 3D molecular geometries that iteratively builds a molecule from molecular fragments. Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</description>
