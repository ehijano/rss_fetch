      <title>Inference, interference and invariance: How the Quantum Fourier Transform can help to learn from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we take inspiration from a typical quantum algorithm to design heuristics for machine learning? A common blueprint, used from Deutsch-Josza to Shor's algorithm, is to place labeled information in superposition via an oracle, interfere in Fourier space, and measure. In this paper, we want to understand how this interference strategy can be used for inference, i.e. to generalize from finite data samples to a ground truth. Our investigative framework is built around the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP), which we transform into a learning task by replacing the oracle with classical training data. The standard quantum algorithm for solving the HSP uses the Quantum Fourier Transform to expose an invariant subspace, i.e., a subset of Hilbert space in which the hidden symmetry is manifest. Based on this insight, we propose an inference principle that "compares" the data to this invariant subspace, and suggest a concrete implementation via overlaps of quantum states. We hope that this leads to well-motivated quantum heuristics that can leverage symmetries for machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum distinguishability measures: projectors vs. states maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinguishability between two quantum states can be defined in terms of their trace distance. The operational meaning of this definition involves a maximization over measurement projectors. Here we introduce an alternative definition of distinguishability which, instead of projectors, is based on maximization over normalized states (density matrices). It is shown that this procedure leads to a distance (between two states) that, in contrast to the usual approach based on a 1-norm, is based on an infinite-norm. Properties such as convexity, monotonicity, and invariance under unitary transformations are fulfilled. Equivalent operational implementations based on maximization over classical probabilities and hypothesis testing scenarios are also established. When considering the action of completely positive transformations contractivity is only granted for unital maps. This feature allows us to introduce a measure of the quantumness of non-unital maps that can be written in terms of the proposed distinguishability measure and corresponds to the maximal possible deviation from contractivity. Particular examples sustain the main results and conclusions.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Based Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Model for Surface Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the volume of data increased the size and complexity of the deep learning models. These models are now more resource-intensive and time-consuming for training than ever. This paper presents a quantum transfer learning (QTL) based approach to significantly reduce the number of parameters of the classical models without compromising their performance, sometimes even improving it. Reducing the number of parameters reduces overfitting problems and training time and increases the models' flexibility and speed of response. For illustration, we have selected a surface anomaly detection problem to show that we can replace the resource-intensive and less flexible anomaly detection system (ADS) with a quantum transfer learning-based hybrid model to address the frequent emergence of new anomalies better. We showed that we could reduce the total number of trainable parameters up to 90% of the initial model without any drop in performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for hypergraph simplex finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum query algorithms for simplex finding, a generalization of triangle finding to hypergraphs. This problem satisfies a rank-reduction property: a quantum query algorithm for finding simplices in rank-$r$ hypergraphs can be turned into a faster algorithm for finding simplices in rank-$(r-1)$ hypergraphs. We then show that every nested Johnson graph quantum walk (with any constant number of nested levels) can be converted into an adaptive learning graph. Then, we introduce the concept of $\alpha$-symmetric learning graphs, which is a useful framework for designing and analyzing complex quantum search algorithms. Inspired by the work of Le Gall, Nishimura, and Tani (2016) on $3$-simplex finding, we use our new technique to obtain an algorithm for $4$-simplex finding in rank-$4$ hypergraphs with $O(n^{2.46})$ quantum query cost, improving the trivial $O(n^{2.5})$ algorithm.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in cyber security. Technological advancement brings new cyber-physical threats like network intrusion, financial fraud, identity theft, and property invasion. In the rapidly changing world, with frequently emerging new types of anomalies, classical machine learning models are insufficient to prevent all the threats. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is emerging as a powerful computational tool that can detect anomalies more efficiently. In this work, we have introduced QML and its applications for anomaly detection in consumer electronics. We have shown a generic framework for applying QML algorithms in anomaly detection tasks. We have also briefly discussed popular supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning-based QML algorithms and included five case studies of recent works to show their applications in anomaly detection in the consumer electronics field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Moir\'{e}-like pattern in non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark ladder system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of the non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark ladder system, which is a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with a position-dependent real potential. In the presence of a linear external field, we employ the non-Hermitian Floquet method and find that the energy levels are sensitive to the field. The system exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors separated by an exceptional point: one in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetrical region associated with two real Wannier-Stark ladders, and another in the $\mathcal{PT}$\ symmetry-breaking region associated with complex conjugate ladders. As the boundary between the two regions, two ladders coalesce into a single ladder. In the case of a non-linear field, these two distinct regions appear alternately along the chain, exhibiting dynamic Moir\'{e}-like patterns.</description>

      <title>Learning to Synthesize Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuits by Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilation of quantum programs into circuits expressed with discrete gate sets is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Optimal methods for discovering high-precision implementations of unitaries in discrete gate sets such as the Clifford+T gate set are intractable. Search-based synthesis methods, including Reinforcement Learning (RL) and simulated annealing, are promising as they empirically discover efficient implementations of low-depth unitaries. We leverage search-based methods to reduce the general unitary synthesis problem to one of synthesizing diagonal unitaries; a problem solvable efficiently in general and optimally in the single-qubit case. Relying on several improvements in deep learning architectures essential for quantum datasets, our RL-based approach demonstrates how search-based methods and mathematical decompositions can be combined to efficiently find high precision implementations of unitaries taken from an array of real quantum algorithms. On these benchmarks we observe up to an average of 94% fewer non-Clifford gates compared to the Quantum Shannon Decomposition.</description>

      <title>Universal bound on the relaxation rates for quantum Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation rates provide important characteristics both for classical and quantum processes. Essentially they control how fast the system thermalizes, equilibrates, {decoheres, and/or dissipates}. Moreover, very often they are directly accessible to be measured in the laboratory and hence they define key physical properties of the system. Experimentally measured relaxation rates can be used to test validity of a particular theoretical model. Here we analyze a fundamental question: {\em does quantum mechanics provide any nontrivial constraint for relaxation rates?} We prove the conjecture formulated a few years ago that any quantum channel implies that a maximal rate is bounded from above by the sum of all the relaxation rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. It should be stressed that this constraint is universal (it is valid for all quantum systems with finite number of energy levels) and it is tight (cannot be improved). In addition, the constraint plays an analogous role to the seminal Bell inequalities and the well known Leggett-Garg inequalities (sometimes called temporal Bell inequalities). Violations of Bell inequalities rule out local hidden variable models, and violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities rule out macrorealism. Similarly, violations of the bound rule out completely positive-divisible evolution.</description>

      <title>Security Loophole Induced by Photorefractive Effect in Continous-variable Quantum Key Distribution System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulators based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure are widely used in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems. MZI-based variable optical attenuator (VOA) and amplitude modulator can reshape the waveform and control the intensity of coherent state signal to realize secret key information modulation in CVQKD system. However, these devices are not ideal, internal and external effects like non-linear effect and temperature may degrade their performance. In this paper, we analyzed the security loophole of CVQKD under the photorefractive effect (PE), which originates from the crystal characteristic of lithium niobate (LN). It is found that the refractive index change of modulators because of PE may lead to an overestimate or underestimate of the final secret key rate. This allows Eve to perform further attacks like intercept-resend to get more secret key information. To solve this problem, several countermeasures are proposed, which can effectively eliminate potential risks.</description>

      <title>Type-Based Verification of Connectivity Constraints in Lattice Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation using lattice surgery can be abstracted as operations on graphs, wherein each logical qubit corresponds to a vertex of the graph, and multi-qubit measurements are accomplished by connecting the vertices with paths between them. Operations attempting to connect vertices without a valid path will result in abnormal termination. As the permissible paths may evolve during execution, it is necessary to statically verify that the execution of a quantum program can be completed.
  This paper introduces a type-based method to statically verify that well-typed programs can be executed without encountering halts induced by surgery operations. Alongside, we present $\mathcal{Q}_{LS}$, a first-order quantum programming language to formalize the execution model of surgery operations. Furthermore, we provide a type checking algorithm by reducing the type checking problem to the offline dynamic connectivity problem.</description>

      <title>GALIC: Hybrid Multi-Qubitwise Pauli Grouping for Quantum Computing Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observable estimation is a core primitive in NISQ-era algorithms targeting quantum chemistry applications. To reduce the state preparation overhead required for accurate estimation, recent works have proposed various simultaneous measurement schemes to lower estimator variance. Two primary grouping schemes have been proposed: fully commutativity (FC) and qubit-wise commutativity (QWC), with no compelling means of interpolation. In this work we propose a generalized framework for designing and analyzing context-aware hybrid FC/QWC commutativity relations. We use our framework to propose a noise-and-connectivity aware grouping strategy: Generalized backend-Aware pauLI Commutation (GALIC). We demonstrate how GALIC interpolates between FC and QWC, maintaining estimator accuracy in Hamiltonian estimation while lowering variance by an average of 20% compared to QWC. We also explore the design space of near-term quantum devices using the GALIC framework, specifically comparing device noise levels and connectivity. We find that error suppression has a more than $13\times$ larger impact on device-aware estimator variance than qubit connectivity with even larger correlation differences in estimator biases.</description>

      <title>Geometric two-qubit gates in silicon-based double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity two-qubit gates is crucial for spin qubits in silicon double quantum dots. However, the two-qubit gates in experiments are easily suffered from charge noise, which is still a key challenge. Geometric gates which implement gate operations employing pure geometric phase are believed to be a powerful way to realize robust control. In this work, we theoretically propose feasible strategy to implement geometric two-qubit gates for silicon-based spin qubits considering experimental control environments. By working in the suitable region where the local magnetic field gradient is much larger than the exchange interaction, we are able to implement entangling and non-entangling geometric gates via analytical and numerical methods. It is found that the implemented geometric gates can obtain fidelities surpassing 99\% for the noise level related to the experiments. Also, they can outperform the dynamical opertations. Our work paves a way to implement high-fidelity geometric gate for spin qubits in silicon.</description>

      <title>A superresolution-enhanced spectrometer beyond the Cramer-Rao bound in phase sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurement has been an important research area in sensing and metrology. In classical physics, the Fisher information determines the maximum extractable information from statistically unknown signals, based on a joint probability density function of independently and identically distributed random variables. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) indicates the minimum error of the Fisher information, generally known as the shot-noise limit. On the other hand, coherence has pushed the resolution limit further overcoming the diffraction limit using many-wave interference strictly confined to the first-order intensity correlation. However, practical implementation is limited by the lithographic constraints in, e.g., optical gratings. Recently, a coherence technique of superresolution has been introduced to overcome the diffraction limit in phase sensitivity using higher-order intensity correlations of a phase-controlled output field from an interferometer. Here, the superresolution is adopted for precision metrology in an optical spectrometer, whose enhanced frequency resolution is linearly proportional to the intensity-product order, overcoming CRLB. Unlike quantum sensing using entangled photons, this technique is purely classical and offers robust performance against environmental noises, benefiting from the interferometer scanning mode for fringe counting.</description>

Abstract: Driven-dissipative nonlinear systems exhibit rich critical behavior, related to bifurcation, bistability and switching, which underlie key phenomena in areas ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to social sciences and economics. The importance of rare fluctuations leading to a dramatic jump between two very distinct states, such as survival and extinction in population dynamics, success and bankruptcy in economics and the occurrence of earthquakes or of epileptic seizures, have been already established. In the quantum domain, switching is of importance in both chemical reactions and the devices used in quantum state detection and amplification. In particular, the simplest driven single oscillator model serves as an insightful starting point. Here we describe switching induced by quantum fluctuations and illustrate that an instanton approach within Keldysh field theory can provide a deep insight into such phenomena. We provide a practical recipe to compute the switching rates semi-analytically, which agrees remarkably well with exact solutions across a wide domain of drive amplitudes spanning many orders of magnitude. Being set up in the framework of Keldysh coherent states path integrals, our approach opens the possibility of studying quantum activation in many-body systems where other approaches are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Binary-Neuron Algorithm for Accurate Multi-Story Floor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate floor localization in a multi-story environment is an important but challenging task. Among the current floor localization techniques, fingerprinting is the mainstream technology due to its accuracy in noisy environments. To achieve accurate floor localization in a building with many floors, we have to collect sufficient data on each floor, which needs significant storage and running time; preventing fingerprinting techniques from scaling to support large multi-story buildings, especially on a worldwide scale. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for accurate multi-story localization. The proposed algorithm leverages quantum computing concepts to provide an exponential enhancement in both space and running time compared to the classical counterparts. In addition, it builds on an efficient binary-neuron implementation that can be implemented using fewer qubits compared to the typical non-binary neurons, allowing for easier deployment with near-term quantum devices. We implement the proposed algorithm on a real IBM quantum machine and evaluate it on three real indoor testbeds. Results confirm the exponential saving in both time and space for the proposed quantum algorithm, while keeping the same localization accuracy compared to the traditional classical techniques, and using half the number of qubits required for other quantum localization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for strong classical simulation of quantum circuits based on optimally k-partitioning ZX-diagrams, reducing each part individually, and then efficiently cross-referencing their results to conclude the overall probability amplitude of the original circuit. We then analyse how this method fares against the alternatives for circuits of various size, shape, and interconnectedness and demonstrate how it is often liable to outperform those alternatives in speed by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Near Infrared Quantum Ghost Spectroscopy for Threats Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Sensing is a rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology offering key resources, beyond classical ones, with potential for commercialisation of novel (quantum) sensors. The exploitation of quantum resources offered by photons can boost the performance of quantum sensors for innovative and challenging applications. In this paper we build on the idea of the Quantum Ghost Spectroscopy (QGS), i.e. the counterpart in the frequency domain of Quantum Ghost Imaging (QGI), targeting specific applications in the detection of possible threats. This is implemented by exploiting the opportunities offered by Quantum Optics, i.e. the generation of photon pairs characterized by spectral correlations. We will discuss our main results obtained with pure QGS experiments showing that it is possible to assess the presence of a target dealing with a low resources measurement. The time-frequency domain reveals a huge potential for several applications and frequency correlations represent a versatile tool that can be exploited to enable the spectral analysis of objects where a direct measurement would not be feasible (e.g. security). The use of nondegenerate sources of correlated photons allowed to reveal spectral features in the near infrared wavelengths employing the usual detectors for the visible region.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Monogamy of Entanglement for Three Qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement in a multiparty system can be described through the principles of monogamy or polygamy. Monogamy is a fundamental characteristic of entanglement that restricts its distribution among several number of parties(more than two). In this work, our aim is to explore how quantum entanglement can be distributed in accordance with monogamy relations by utilizing both the genuine multipartite entanglement measures and bipartite entanglement measures. Specifically, we treat source entanglement as the genuine multipartite entanglement measure and use the entanglement of formation specifically for bipartite cases. For GHZ class states, we analytically demonstrate that the square of the source entanglement serves as an upper bound for the sum of the squares of the entanglement of formation of the reduced subsystems, with some exceptions for specific non-generic GHZ states. We also present numerical evidence supporting this result for W class states. Additionally, we explore the monogamy relation by using accessible entanglement as an upper bound.</description>

      <title>A nondestructive Bell-state measurement on two distant atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum networks is their capability to distribute entanglement as a nonlocal communication resource. In a first step, this requires network-ready devices that can generate and store entangled states. Another crucial step, however, is to develop measurement techniques that allow for entanglement detection. Demonstrations for different platforms suffer from being either not complete, or destructive, or local. Here we demonstrate a complete and nondestructive measurement scheme that always projects any initial state of two spatially separated network nodes onto a maximally entangled state. Each node consists of an atom trapped inside an optical resonator from which two photons are successively reflected. Polarisation measurements on the photons discriminate between the four maximally entangled states. Remarkably, such states are not destroyed by our measurement. In the future, our technique might serve to probe the decay of entanglement and to stabilise it against dephasing via repeated measurements.</description>

      <title>Gaussian unsteerable channels and computable quantifications of Gaussian steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current quantum resource theory for Gaussian steering for continuous-variable systems is flawed and incomplete. Its primary shortcoming stems from an inadequate comprehension of the architecture of Gaussian channels transforming Gaussian unsteerable states into Gaussian unsteerable states, resulting in a restricted selection of free operations. In the present paper, we explore in depth the structure of such $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian channels, and introduce the class of the Gaussian unsteerable channels and the class of maximal Gaussian unsteerable channels, both of them may be chosen as the free operations, which completes the resource theory for Gaussian steering from $A$ to $B$ by Alice's Gaussian measurements. We also propose two quantifications $\mathcal{J}_{j}$ $(j=1,2)$ of $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian steering from $A$ to $B$. The computation of the value of $\mathcal{J}_{j}$ is straightforward and efficient, as it solely relies on the covariance matrices of Gaussian states, eliminating the need for any optimization procedures. Though $\mathcal{J}_{j}$s are not genuine Gaussian steering measures, they have some nice properties such as non-increasing under certain Gaussian unsteerable channels. Additionally, we compare ${\mathcal J}_2$ with the Gaussian steering measure $\mathcal N_3$, which is based on the Uhlmann fidelity, revealing that ${\mathcal J}_2$ is an upper bound of $\mathcal N_3$ at certain class of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian pure states. As an illustration, we apply $\mathcal J_2$ to discuss the behaviour of Gaussian steering for a special class of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states in Markovian environments, which uncovers the intriguing phenomenon of rapid decay in quantum steering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Quantum Extreme Learning Machines for image classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in quantum machine learning is increasingly growing due to the possibility of developing efficient solutions to problems that are difficult to tackle with classical methods. In this context, the research work presented here focuses on the use of quantum machine learning techniques for image classification tasks. We exploit a quantum extreme learning machine by taking advantage of its rich feature map provided by the quantum reservoir substrate. We systematically analyse different phases of the quantum extreme learning machine process, from the dataset preparation to the image final classification. In particular, we investigate the impact of encoding through a Principal Component Analysis and the use of Auto-Encoders, as well as the dynamics of the model through the use of different Hamiltonians for the quantum reservoir. Our results show that the introduction of a quantum reservoir systematically improves the accuracy of the classifier. Additionally, while different encodings can lead to significantly different performances, Hamiltonians with varying degrees of connectivity exhibit the same discrimination rate, provided they are interacting.</description>

      <title>Noisy Probabilistic Error Cancellation and Generalized Physical Implementability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum decoherent noises have significantly influenced the performance of practical quantum processors. Probabilistic error cancellation quantum error mitigation method quasiprobabilistically simulates the noise inverse operations, which are not physical channels, to cancel the noises. Physical implementability is the minimal cost to simulate a non-physical quantum operation with physical channels by the quasiprobabilistic decomposition. However, in practical, this cancellation may also be influenced by noises, and the implementable channels are not all of the physical channels, so the physical implementability is not sufficient to completely depict the practical situation of the probabilistic error cancellation method. Therefore, we generalize the physical implementability to an arbitrary convex set of free quantum resources and discuss several of its properties. We demonstrate the way to optimally cancel the error channel with the noisy Pauli basis. In addition, we also discuss the several properties relevant to this generalization. We expect that its properties and structures will be investigated comprehensively, and it will have more applications in the field of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for large-scale quantum-network deployments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.</description>

      <title>On encoded quantum gate generation by iterative Lyapunov-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of encoded quantum gate generation is studied in this paper. The idea is to consider a quantum system of higher dimension $n$ than the dimension $\bar n$ of the quantum gate to be synthesized. Given two orthonormal subsets $\mathbb{E} = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{\bar n}\}$ and $\mathbb F = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{\bar n}\}$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$, the problem of encoded quantum gate generation consists in obtaining an open loop control law defined in an interval $[0, T_f]$ in a way that all initial states $e_i$ are steered to $\exp(\jmath \phi) f_i, i=1,2, \ldots ,\bar n$ up to some desired precision and to some global phase $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$. This problem includes the classical (full) quantum gate generation problem, when $\bar n = n$, the state preparation problem, when $\bar n = 1$, and finally the encoded gate generation when $ 1 &lt; \bar n &lt; n$. Hence, three problems are unified here within a unique common approach. The \emph{Reference Input Generation Algorithm (RIGA)} is generalized in this work for considering the encoded gate generation problem for closed quantum systems. A suitable Lyapunov function is derived from the orthogonal projector on the support of the encoded gate. Three case-studies of physical interest indicate the potential interest of such numerical algorithm: two coupled transmon-qubits, a cavity mode coupled to a transmon-qubit, and a chain of $N$ qubits, including a large dimensional case for which $N=10$.</description>

      <title>Low threshold quantum correlations via synthetic magnetism in Brillouin optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate low driving threshold quantum correlations in Brillouin optomechanical system based on synthetic magnetism. Our proposal consists of a mechanical (acoustic) resonator coupled to two optical modes through the standard optomechanical radiation pressure (an electrostrictive force). The electrostrictive force that couples the acoustic mode to the optical ones striggers Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process in the system. Moreover, the mechanical and acoustic resonators are mechanically coupled through the coupling rate $J_m$, which is $\theta$-phase modulated. Without a mechanical coupling, the generated quantum correlations require a strong driving field. By accounting phonon hopping coupling, the synthetic magnetism is induced and the quantum correlations are generated for low coupling strengths. The generated quantum correlations display sudden death and revival phenonmena, and are robust against thermal noise. Our results suggest a way for low threshold quantum correlations generation, and are useful for quantum communications, quantum sensors, and quantum computational tasks.</description>

Abstract: Emergence of objective, classical properties in quantum systems can be described in the modern language of quantum information theory. In this work, we present an example of such an analysis. We apply the quantum channel theory to a boson-spin model of open quantum systems and calculate, using recoilless approximation and the Floquet theory, the Hoevo quantity, which bounds the capacity of the channel, broadcasting information about the central system into its environment. We analyze both the short-time regime, showing quadratic in time initial growth of the capacity, and the asymptotic regime. Complicated dependence on the model parameters, such as temperature, tunneling energy for the environment, etc is also analyzed, showing e.g. regimes where the Holevo bound reaches its maximum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric-quadrupole transition, and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: In large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers, photons are the fundamental carriers of information as so-called flying qubits. They may also serve as the interconnect between different components of a hybrid architecture, which might comprise atomic and solid state platforms operating at visible or near-infrared wavelengths, as well as optical links in the telecom band. Quantum frequency conversion is the pathway to change the color of a single photon while preserving its quantum state. Currently, nonlinear crystals are utilized for this process. However, their performance is limited by their acceptance bandwidth, tunability, polarization sensitivity, as well as undesired background emission. A promising alternative is based on stimulated Raman scattering in gases.
  Here, we demonstrate polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber. This approach holds promises for seamless integration into optical fiber networks and interfaces to single emitters. Disparate from related experiments that employ a pulsed pump field, we here take advantage of two coherent continuous-wave pump fields.</description>

      <title>An inconsistency in the CHSH inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. We show that the mathematical assumptions underlying the proof of the CHSH inequality are, in fact, incompatible with the physics of the experiments testing such inequality. This implies that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data yet. However, we also show that an experimental proof of CHSH inequality is, in principle, possible, but it is unclear how to implement, in practice, such an experiment.</description>

      <title>Generating Approximate Ground States of Strongly Correlated Quantum Many-Body Systems Through Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most quantum algorithms designed to generate or probe properties of the ground state of a quantum many-body system require as input an initial state with a large overlap with the desired ground state. One approach for preparing such a ground state is Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Recent work by [Motta, M., Sun, C., Tan, A.T.K. et al. (2020)] introduced an algorithm -- which we will refer to as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) -- that shows how ITE can be approximated by a sequence of unitary operators, making QITE potentially implementable on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we provide a heuristic study of the capabilities of the QITE algorithm in approximating the ITE of lattice and molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. We numerically study the performance of the QITE algorithm when provided with a good classical initial state for a large class of systems, some of which are of interest to industrial applications, and check if QITE is able to qualitatively replicate the ITE behavior and improve over a classical mean-field solution. The systems we consider in this work range from one- and two-dimensional lattice systems of various lattice geometries displaying short- and long-range interactions, to active spaces of molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. In addition to the comparison of QITE and ITE, we explicitly show how imaginary time evolved fermionic Gaussian states can serve as initial states which can be efficiently computed on classical computers and efficiently implemented on quantum computers for generic spin Hamiltonians in arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Test of Quantum Gravity via Angular Momentum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction governed by the Newtonian potential. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering a tree-level relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Noise of Driven Controlled Field Using the Central Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the coherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherency due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment allows partial revivals of coherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows. Our findings have potential applications in the noise spectroscopy of external signals.</description>

      <title>Quantum mereology and subsystems from the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal ingredients to describe a quantum system are a Hamiltonian, an initial state, and a preferred tensor product structure that encodes a decomposition into subsystems. We explore a top-down approach in which the subsystems emerge from the spectrum of the whole system. This approach has been referred to as quantum mereology. First we show that decomposing a system into subsystems is equivalent to decomposing a spectrum into other spectra. Then we argue that the number of subsystems (the volume of the system) can be inferred from the spectrum itself. In local models, this information is encoded in finite size corrections to the Gaussian density of states.</description>

      <title>Optimal training of finitely-sampled quantum reservoir computers for forecasting of chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the presence of noise deteriorates the performance of quantum computing algorithms. Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is a type of Quantum Machine Learning algorithm, which, however, can benefit from different types of tuned noise. In this paper, we analyse the effect that finite-sampling noise has on the chaotic time-series prediction capabilities of QRC and Recurrence-free Quantum Reservoir Computing (RF-QRC). First, we show that, even without a recurrent loop, RF-QRC contains temporal information about previous reservoir states using leaky integrated neurons. This makes RF-QRC different from Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM). Second, we show that finite sampling noise degrades the prediction capabilities of both QRC and RF-QRC while affecting QRC more due to the propagation of noise. Third, we optimize the training of the finite-sampled quantum reservoir computing framework using two methods: (a) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applied to the data matrix containing noisy reservoir activation states; and (b) data-filtering techniques to remove the high-frequencies from the noisy reservoir activation states. We show that denoising reservoir activation states improve the signal-to-noise ratios with smaller training loss. Finally, we demonstrate that the training and denoising of the noisy reservoir activation signals in RF-QRC are highly parallelizable on multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) as compared to the QRC architecture with recurrent connections. The analyses are numerically showcased on prototypical chaotic dynamical systems with relevance to turbulence. This work opens opportunities for using quantum reservoir computing with finite samples for time-series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Error filtration from optimized quantum circuit interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an optimized hardware strategy to mitigate errors in a noisy qubit. Our scheme builds on the physical principle of error filtration and exploits auxiliary qubits. Both signal and ancillas are subject to local noise, yet constructive interference (and in some cases post-selection) allows us to reduce the level of noise in the signal qubit. Seeking for the optimal unitary that makes the qubits interfere in the most effective way, we start with a set of universal gates and proceed by optimizing suitable functionals by gradient descent or stochastic approximation. We benchmark our approach against a number of figure of merits that correspond to different applications, including entanglement fidelity, quantum Fisher information (for applications in quantum sensing), and CHSH value (for applications in tests of non-locality and quantum cryptography), with one, two, and three ancillary qubits. With one and two ancillas we also provide explicit expressions from an ansatz for an optimal unitary.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation Circuit Optimization Exploiting Don't Cares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation initializes the quantum registers and is essential for running quantum algorithms. Designing state preparation circuits that entangle qubits efficiently with fewer two-qubit gates enhances accuracy and alleviates coupling constraints on devices. Existing methods synthesize an initial circuit and leverage compilers to reduce the circuit's gate count while preserving the unitary equivalency. In this study, we identify numerous conditions within the quantum circuit where breaking local unitary equivalences does not alter the overall outcome of the state preparation (i.e., don't cares). We introduce a peephole optimization algorithm that identifies such unitaries for replacement in the original circuit. Exploiting these don't care conditions, our algorithm achieves a 36% reduction in the number of two-qubit gates compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Qubit Velocity on Quantum Synchronization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum synchronization dynamics of a moving qubit within a dissipative cavity environment, leveraging the Husimi $Q$-function to analyze the phase space evolution. The study explores a range of coupling strengths between the qubit and the cavity field, focusing on the interplay between qubit velocity and system detuning. In the weak coupling regime ($\lambda = 5\gamma$), the system rapidly decoheres, exhibiting minimal synchronization. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime ($\lambda = 0.01\gamma$), we observe more intricate dynamics, including phase locking and oscillatory behavior, indicating a better degree of synchronization. Our findings reveal that the qubit's velocity and detuning influence synchronization, offering potential pathways to enhance coherence in quantum systems. These insights have significant implications for quantum computing and quantum communication, where controlling synchronization can improve the stability and security of quantum states. Moreover, the ability to manipulate synchronization through environmental parameters suggests new applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where precise control of quantum states is essential.</description>

      <title>An almost-linear time decoding algorithm for quantum LDPC codes under circuit-level noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers must be designed in conjunction with classical co-processors that decode quantum error correction measurement information in real-time. In this work, we introduce the belief propagation plus ordered Tanner forest (BP+OTF) algorithm as an almost-linear time decoder for quantum low-density parity-check codes. The OTF post-processing stage removes qubits from the decoding graph until it has a tree-like structure. Provided that the resultant loop-free OTF graph supports a subset of qubits that can generate the syndrome, BP decoding is then guaranteed to converge. To enhance performance under circuit-level noise, we introduce a technique for sparsifying detector error models. This method uses a transfer matrix to map soft information from the full detector graph to the sparsified graph, preserving critical error propagation information from the syndrome extraction circuit. Our BP+OTF implementation first applies standard BP to the full detector graph, followed by BP+OTF post-processing on the sparsified graph. Numerical simulations show that the BP+OTF decoder achieves logical error suppression within an order of magnitude of state-of-the-art inversion-based decoders while maintaining almost-linear runtime complexity across all stages.</description>

      <title>Time Derivatives of Weak Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time derivative of a physical property frequently gives rise to another meaningful property. Since weak values offer empirical insights that cannot be derived from expectation values, this paper investigates what physical properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It shows that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak value is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant element. Two conditions are presented to ensure that a time derivative of a weak value is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under such conditions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem is presented: a uniquely measured weak value of the position gives information on the local velocity and the acceleration of the system, through the first-order and second-order time derivatives of the weak value, without further measurements. These results serve as guidelines for experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into laboratory setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be obtained, at specific positions and times, from a weak value's first- and second-order time derivatives.</description>

Abstract: We revisit key notions related to evolution of quantum information in quantum mechanics and prove uniform bounds on the maximal speed of propagation of quantum information for states and observables with exponential error bounds. Our results imply, in particular, a quantum mechanical version of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which is known to yield various constraints on propagation of quantum information. We propose a novel approach to proving maximal speed bounds.</description>

      <title>Can Geometric Quantum Machine Learning Lead to Advantage in Barcode Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distinguishing two vectors (visualized as images or barcodes) and learning if they are related to one another. For this, we develop a geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) approach with embedded symmetries that allows for the classification of similar and dissimilar pairs based on global correlations, and enables generalization from just a few samples. Unlike GQML algorithms developed to date, we propose to focus on symmetry-aware measurement adaptation that outperforms unitary parametrizations. We compare GQML for similarity testing against classical deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks with Siamese architectures. We show that quantum networks largely outperform their classical counterparts. We explain this difference in performance by analyzing correlated distributions used for composing our dataset. We relate the similarity testing with problems that showcase a proven maximal separation between the BQP complexity class and the polynomial hierarchy. While the ability to achieve advantage largely depends on how data are loaded, we discuss how similar problems can benefit from quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Kerr magnon assisted asymptotic stationary photon-phonon squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states in continuous variable systems, which have broad applications in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a photon-phonon squeezing protocol assisted by a Kerr magnon within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. We construct an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for photon-phonon squeezing through strong photon-magnon interaction and precise modulation over the driving frequency on the photon mode. The effective Hamiltonian can be confirmed by a fascinating method about the diagonalization of the system's Liouvilian superoperator. This method can address the level attractions rather than avoided level crossings in the energy diagram of the whole system. With the effective Hamiltonian and quantum Langevin equation, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation. Our finding indicates that asymptotic stationary squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even when the covariance matrix of the system still varies with time. This squeezing level can exceed the maximum value under stable conditions. Moreover, our analysis also reveals that the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnon can further promote the squeezing generation. Our work provides an extendable framework for generating squeezed states that entangle two Gaussian modes with indirect coupling.</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the need to simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails exponentially-scaling computational costs with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will generally require a fault-tolerant QC, which is currently beyond technological capabilities. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed for computing OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC as well as a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating labelled data via an efficient numerical algorithm that utilises matrix product operators to simulate quantum many-body systems, with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the best kernels consistently achieve a high coefficient of determination ($R^2$) on the testing sets, typically between 0.9 and 0.99, and almost always exceeding 0.8. This demonstrates that classical kernels supplied with a moderate amount of training data can be used to closely and efficiently approximate OTOCs and related quantities for a diverse range of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Single nuclear spin detection and control in a van der Waals material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are leading candidates for quantum sensing and quantum networking. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Due to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects remain unknown, and detecting a single nuclear spin with an hBN spin defect has been elusive. In this study, we created single spin defects in hBN using $^{13}$C ion implantation and identified three distinct defect types. We observed both $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ spin states within a single hBN spin defect, with only the $S=1/2$ states showing strong hyperfine interactions with nearby $^{13}$C nuclear spins. For the first time, we demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material. By comparing experimental results with density-functional theory calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.</description>

      <title>AQ-PINNs: Attention-Enhanced Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Carbon-Efficient Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing computational demands of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing climate change raise significant concerns about inefficiencies and environmental impact, as highlighted by the Jevons paradox. We propose an attention-enhanced quantum physics-informed neural networks model (AQ-PINNs) to tackle these challenges. This approach integrates quantum computing techniques into physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for climate modeling, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy in fluid dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations while reducing the computational burden and carbon footprint. By harnessing variational quantum multi-head self-attention mechanisms, our AQ-PINNs achieve a 51.51% reduction in model parameters compared to classical multi-head self-attention methods while maintaining comparable convergence and loss. It also employs quantum tensor networks to enhance representational capacity, which can lead to more efficient gradient computations and reduced susceptibility to barren plateaus. Our AQ-PINNs represent a crucial step towards more sustainable and effective climate modeling solutions.</description>

      <title>Classically estimating observables of noiseless quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on most quantum circuits across all circuit architectures and depths, including those with all-to-all connectivity. We prove that for any architecture where each circuit layer is equipped with a measure invariant under single-qubit rotations, our algorithm achieves a small error $\varepsilon$ on all circuits except for a small fraction $\delta$. The computational time is polynomial in qubit count and circuit depth for any small constant $\varepsilon, \delta$, and quasi-polynomial for inverse-polynomially small $\varepsilon, \delta$. For non-classically-simulable input states or observables, the expectation values can be estimated by augmenting our algorithm with classical shadows of the relevant state or observable. Our approach leverages a Pauli-path method under Heisenberg evolution. While prior works are limited to noisy quantum circuits, we establish classical simulability in noiseless regimes. Given that most quantum circuits in an architecture exhibit chaotic and locally scrambling behavior, our work demonstrates that estimating observables of such quantum dynamics is classically tractable across all geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Byzantine Agreement Against Full-information Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit that, when given a classical Byzantine agreement protocol designed in the private-channel model, it is feasible to construct a quantum agreement protocol that can effectively handle a full-information adversary. Notably, both protocols have equivalent levels of resilience, round complexity, and communication complexity. In the classical private-channel scenario, participating players are limited to exchanging classical bits, with the adversary lacking knowledge of the exchanged messages. In contrast, in the quantum full-information setting, participating players can exchange qubits, while the adversary possesses comprehensive and accurate visibility into the system's state and messages. By showcasing the reduction from quantum to classical frameworks, this paper demonstrates the strength and flexibility of quantum protocols in addressing security challenges posed by adversaries with increased visibility. It underscores the potential of leveraging quantum principles to improve security measures without compromising on efficiency or resilience. By applying our reduction, we demonstrate quantum advantages in the round complexity of asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols in the full-information model. It is well known that in the full-information model, any classical protocol requires $\Omega(n)$ rounds to solve Byzantine agreement with probability one even against Fail-stop adversary when resilience $t=\Theta(n)$. We show that quantum protocols can achieve $O(1)$ rounds (i) with resilience $t&lt;n/2$ against a Fail-stop adversary, and (ii) with resilience $t&lt;n/(3+\epsilon)$ against a Byzantine adversary for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, therefore surpassing the classical lower bound.</description>

      <title>Tunable multiphoton bundles emission in a Kerr-type two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on manipulation and enhancement of multiphoton bundles emission under a moderate atom-cavity coupling, by constructing a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model integrated with Kerr nonlinearity in a single atom-cavity system. We show that the vacuum-Rabi splittings for the $n$th dressed states can be significantly enhanced by Kerr interaction. This remarkable enhancement in energy-spectrum anharmonicity with the well-resolved multiphoton resonance facilitates the generation of special nonclassical states beyond the strong-coupling limit in the experiment. In particular, both two- and three-photon blockades are observed with adjusting the amplitude of the cavity-driving or atom-pump fields. Moreover, we discover that transitions between two- and three-photon bundles can be achieved through tuning the atom-cavity detuning or Kerr nonlinearity. It further showcases the three-photon blockade is substantially strengthened when both the cavity and atomic fields are jointly driven. Our proposal unveils a pathway for realizing highly controllable nonclassical states and quantum devices with combining two-photon Jaynes-Cummings interactions and Kerr nonlinearity, which may pave the way for versatile applications in quantum information science, e.g., all-optical switches and transistors.</description>

      <title>Long-distance strong coupling of magnon and photon: Effect of multi-mode waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled mode theory predicts that the long-distance coupling between two distant harmonic oscillators is in the weak coupling regime. However, a recent experimental measurement observed strong coupling of magnon and critically-driven photon with a distance of over two meters. To explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment, we study long-distance coupling of magnon and photon mediated by a multi-mode waveguide. Our results show that strong coupling is achieved only when both critical coupling and multi-mode waveguide are involved. The former reduces the damping while the latter enhances the coupling strength by increasing the pathways of coupling magnon and photon. Our theory and results pave the way for understanding the long-distance coherence and designing the magnon-based distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Absolute dimensionality of quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimension of a quantum state is traditionally seen as the number of superposed distinguishable states in a given basis. We propose an absolute, i.e.~basis-independent, notion of dimensionality for ensembles of quantum states. It is based on whether a quantum ensemble can be simulated with states confined to arbitrary lower-dimensional subspaces and classical postprocessing. In order to determine the absolute dimension of quantum ensembles, we develop both analytical witness criteria and a semidefinite programming criterion based on the ensemble's information capacity. Furthermore, we construct explicit simulation models for arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states subject to white noise, and in natural cases we prove their optimality. Also, efficient numerical methods are provided for simulating generic ensembles. Finally, we discuss the role of absolute dimensionality in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of non-stabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how non-stabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that non-stabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced control of single-molecule emission frequency and spectral diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stark effect provides a powerful method to shift the spectra of molecules, atoms and electronic transitions in general, becoming one of the simplest and most straightforward way to tune the frequency of quantum emitters by means of a static electric field. At the same time, in order to reduce the emitter sensitivity to charge noise, inversion symmetric systems are typically designed, providing a stable emission frequency, with a quadratic-only dependence on the applied field. However, such nonlinear behaviour might reflect in correlations between the tuning ability and unwanted spectral fluctuations. Here, we provide experimental evidence of this trend, using molecular quantum emitters in the solid state cooled down to liquid helium temperatures. We finally combine the electric field generated by electrodes, which results parallel to the molecule induced dipole, to optically excite long-lived charge states, acting in the perpendicular direction. Based on the anisotropy of the molecule's polarizability, our two-dimensional control of the local electric field allows not only to tune the emitter's frequency but also to sensibly suppress the spectral instabilities associated to field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Low-Temperature Tunable Microcavity featuring High Passive Stability and Microwave Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport on a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of a finite generation, or the Cayley tree, which may model the energy transport in a light-harvesting molecule. As a new feature to analyze the quantum transport, we add complex potentials for sources on the peripheral sites and for a drain on the central site. We find that the eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site are quite limited to the number of generation. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry the current, which reduces the problem to the quantum transport on a parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric tight-binding chain. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point for the zero-energy states, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the $PT$-symmetric complex potentials. As we introduce randomness in the number of links in each generation of the tree, the resulting linear chain is a random-hopping tight-binding model. We find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly but approximately for a zero-energy state, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for One-Sided Crossing Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present singly-exponential quantum algorithms for the One-Sided Crossing Minimization (OSCM) problem. Given an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $G=(U,V,E\subseteq U \times V)$, a $2$-level drawing $(\pi_U,\pi_V)$ of $G$ is described by a linear ordering $\pi_U: U \leftrightarrow \{1,\dots,|U|\}$ of $U$ and linear ordering $\pi_V: V \leftrightarrow \{1,\dots,|V|\}$ of $V$. For a fixed linear ordering $\pi_U$ of $U$, the OSCM problem seeks to find a linear ordering $\pi_V$ of $V$ that yields a $2$-level drawing $(\pi_U,\pi_V)$ of $G$ with the minimum number of edge crossings. We show that OSCM can be viewed as a set problem over $V$ amenable for exact algorithms with a quantum speedup with respect to their classical counterparts. First, we exploit the quantum dynamic programming framework of Ambainis et al. [Quantum Speedups for Exponential-Time Dynamic Programming Algorithms. SODA 2019] to devise a QRAM-based algorithm that solves OSCM in $O^*(1.728^n)$ time and space. Second, we use quantum divide and conquer to obtain an algorithm that solves OSCM without using QRAM in $O^*(2^n)$ time and polynomial space.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>Self-Testing Quantum Error Correcting Codes: Analyzing Computational Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the tilted Bell inequality for quantum [[n,k,d]] error-correcting codes and explicitly utilize the simplest perfect code, the [[5,1,3]] code, the Steane [[7,1,3]] code, and Shor's [[9,1,3]] code, to demonstrate the self-testing property of their respective codespaces. Additionally, we establish a framework for the proof of self-testing, as detailed in \cite{baccari2020device}, which can be generalized to the codespace of CSS stabilizers. Our method provides a self-testing scheme for $\cos\theta \lvert \bar{0} \rangle + \sin\theta \lvert \bar{1} \rangle$, where $\theta \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, and also discusses its experimental application. We also investigate whether such property can be generalized to qudit and show one no-go theorem.
  We then define a computational problem called ISSELFTEST and describe how this problem formulation can be interpreted as a statement that maximal violation of a specific Bell-type inequality can self-test a particular entanglement subspace. We also discuss the computational complexity of ISSELFTEST in comparison to other classical complexity challenges and some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Ternary Tree Fermion-to-Qubit Mapping with Hamiltonian Aware Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Hamiltonian-Aware Ternary Tree (HATT) framework to compile optimized Fermion-to-qubit mapping for specific Fermionic Hamiltonians. In the simulation of Fermionic quantum systems, efficient Fermion-to-qubit mapping plays a critical role in transforming the Fermionic system into a qubit system. HATT utilizes ternary tree mapping and a bottom-up construction procedure to generate Hamiltonian aware Fermion-to-qubit mapping to reduce the Pauli weight of the qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in lower quantum simulation circuit overhead. Additionally, our optimizations retain the important vacuum state preservation property in our Fermion-to-qubit mapping and reduce the complexity of our algorithm from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N^3)$. Evaluations and simulations of various Fermionic systems demonstrate a significant reduction in both Pauli weight and circuit complexity, alongside excellent scalability to larger systems. Experiments on the Ionq quantum computer also show the advantages of our approach in noise resistance in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum state engineering of light using intensity measurements and post-selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state engineering of light is of great interest for quantum technologies, particularly generating non-classical states of light, and is often studied through quantum conditioning approaches. Recently, we demonstrated that such approaches can be applied in intense laser-atom interactions to generate optical "cat" states by using intensity measurements and classical post-selection of the measurement data. Post-processing of the sampled data set allows to select specific events corresponding to measurement statistics as if there would be non-classical states of light leading to these measurement outcomes. However, to fully realize the potential of this method for quantum state engineering, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the role of the involved measurements and the specifications of the post-selection scheme. We illustrate this by analyzing post-selection schemes recently developed for the process of high harmonic generation, which enables generating optical cat states bright enough to induce non-linear phenomena. These findings provide significant guidance for quantum light engineering and the generation of high-quality, intense optical cat states for applications in non-linear optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence from hyper-invariant tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hyper-invariant tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HaPPY code, including complementary recovery. This hyper-invariant framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Advances in quantum hardware have begun the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era. A pressing question is: what architectures are best suited to take advantage of this new regime of quantum machines? We study various superconducting architectures including Google's Sycamore, IBM's Heavy-Hex, Rigetti's Aspen, and Ankaa in addition to a proposed architecture we call bus next-nearest neighbor (busNNN). We evaluate these architectures using benchmarks based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) which can solve certain quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. We also study compilation tools that target these architectures, which use either general heuristic or deterministic methods to map circuits onto a target topology defined by an architecture.</description>

      <title>Estimating the coherence of noise in mid-scale quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the power of quantum computers is commonly acknowledged to rise exponentially, it is often overlooked that the complexity of quantum noise mechanisms generally grows much faster. In particular, quantifying whether the instructions on a quantum processor are close to being unitary has important consequences concerning error rates, e.g., for the confidence in their estimation, the ability to mitigate them efficiently, or their relation to fault-tolerance thresholds in error correction. However, the complexity of estimating the coherence, or unitarity, of noise generally scales exponentially in system size. Here, we obtain an upper bound on the average unitarity of Pauli noise and develop a protocol allowing us to estimate the average unitarity of operations in a digital quantum device efficiently and feasibly for mid-size quantum systems. We demonstrate our results through both experimental execution on IQM Spark (TM), a 5-qubit superconducting quantum computer, and in simulation with up to 10 qubits, discussing the prospects for extending our technique to arbitrary scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum computing in the last few years has led many countries to make relevant public investments in that field. However, Colombia lacks any investment or legislation in this area. Most previous studies have focused on other countries, contributing to the region's significant lag. In this paper, we propose efforts to include quantum computing as a fundamental pillar of Colombia's development plan. In this research we involved three stakeholders: academia (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), industry (Alianza Team), and government (Vice Ministry of Digital Transformation). We anticipate that our work will provide a connection between all stakeholders involved in public investments in quantum technology in the country and will facilitate its legislation.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac particles based on gapped graphene with Rosen-Morse potential in a uniform magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the gapped graphene structure in the two-dimensional plane in the presence of the Rosen-Morse potential and an external uniform magnetic field. In order to describe the corresponding structure, we consider the propagation of electrons in graphene as relativistic fermion quasi-particles, and analyze it by the wave functions of two-component spinors with pseudo-spin symmetry using the Dirac equation. Next, to solve and analyze the Dirac equation, we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the Legendre differential equation. After that, we obtain the bounded states of energy depending on the coefficients of Rosen-Morse and magnetic potentials in terms of quantum numbers of principal \(n\) and spin-orbit \(k\). Then, the values of the energy spectrum for the ground state and the first excited state are calculated, and the wave functions and the corresponding probabilities are plotted in terms of coordinates $r$. In what follows, we explore the band structure of gapped graphene by the modified dispersion relation and write it in terms of the two-dimensional wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$. Finally, the energy bands are plotted in terms of the wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$ with and without the magnetic term.</description>

      <title>An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify an NV-like center in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this defect has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Optimal displacement detection of arbitrarily-shaped levitated dielectric objects using optical radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically-levitated dielectric objects are promising for precision force, acceleration, torque, and rotation sensing due to their extreme environmental decoupling. While many levitated opto-mechanics experiments employ spherical objects, for some applications non-spherical geometries offer advantages. For example, rod-shaped or dumbbell shaped particles have been demonstrated for torque and rotation sensing and high aspect ratio plate-like particles can exhibit reduced photon recoil heating and may be useful for high-frequency gravitational wave detection or as high bandwidth accelerometers. To achieve optimal sensitivity, cooling, and quantum control in these systems, it is beneficial to achieve optimal displacement detection using scattered light. We describe and numerically implement a method based on Fisher information that is applicable to suspended particles of arbitrary geometry. We demonstrate the agreement between our method and prior methods employed for spherical particles, both in the Rayleigh and Lorentz-Mie regimes. As practical examples we analyze the optical detection limits of an optically-levitated high-aspect-ratio disc-like dielectric object and a rod-shaped object for configurations recently realized in experimental work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~20 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~4 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, in an analytical fashion, quantum Carnot cycles of a microscopic heat engine coupled to two nite heat reservoirs, whose internal cycles could own higher e ciency than the standard Carnot limit without consuming extra quantum resources, e.g., coherence or squeezing properties. The engine runs time-dependently, involving both the internal and external cycles to collaboratively accomplish a complete Carnot cycle, and the e ciency of the engine depends on the reservoirs heat capacities and the working substance. Our analytical results of the maximum efficiency and the maximum power output clarify the mechanism behind the high performance of the microscopic engines, displaying the key roles played by the nite-sized heat reservoirs. Our proposal is generally valid for any microscopic thermodynamic system and fully feasible under current laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bipartite quantum systems kept at different temperatures where a tunnel coupling between the two subsystems induces transitions. We find two independent constraints on the temperature-bias-dependent, out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates between the two subsystems, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the coupled quantum systems are small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to establish and deplete the temperature bias, respectively. The derived constraints apply to a large class of experimentally accessible quantum systems: except for the restriction to the tunneling regime, they hold for arbitrary subsystem Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. These results hold for a large class of experimentally relevant systems, ranging from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <title>INTENTAS -- An entanglement-enhanced atomic sensor for microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INTENTAS project aims to develop an atomic sensor utilizing entangled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a microgravity environment. This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times. Successful demonstration of this technology in the Einstein-Elevator will pave the way for a future deployment in space, where its potential applications will unlock high-precision quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry protected states of quantum spin chains for continuous symmetry groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry protected states (SPT's) of quantum spin systems were studied by several authors. For one-dimensional systems (spin chains), there is an essentially complete and rigorous understanding: SPT's corresponding to finite on-site symmetry groups $G$ are classified by the second cohomology group $H^2(G,U(1))$, as established by Kapustin et al. [J. Math. Phys. (2021)]. We extend this result to the case of compact topological symmetry groups $G$. We also strengthen the existing results in the sense that our classification results holds within the class of spin chains with locally bounded on-site dimensions.</description>

      <title>Error exponents for entanglement transformations from degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the trade-off relation between the rate and the strong converse exponent for asymptotic LOCC transformations between pure multipartite states. Any single-copy probabilistic transformation between a pair of states implies that an asymptotic transformation at rate 1 is possible with an exponentially decreasing success probability. However, it is possible that an asymptotic transformation is feasible with nonzero probability, but there is no transformation between any finite number of copies with the same rate, even probabilistically. In such cases it is not known if the optimal success probability decreases exponentially or faster. A fundamental tool for showing the feasibility of an asymptotic transformation is degeneration. Any degeneration gives rise to a sequence of stochastic LOCC transformations from copies of the initial state plus a sublinear number of GHZ states to the same number of copies of the target state. These protocols involve parameters that can be freely chosen, but the choice affects the success probability. In this paper, we characterize an asymptotically optimal choice of the parameters and derive a single-letter expression for the error exponent of the resulting protocol. In particular, this implies an exponential lower bound on the success probability when the stochastic transformation arises from a degeneration.</description>

      <title>Suppression of soliton collapses, modulational instability, and rogue-wave excitation in two-L\'evy-index fractional Kerr media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: s in laser systems with two fractional-dispersion/diffraction terms, quantified by their L\'{e}vy indices, $\alpha_{1}\, \alpha_{2}\in (1, 2]$, and self-focusing or defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only one L\'{e}vy index $\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\'{e}vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\'{e}vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Single-photon super-resolved spectroscopy from spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate spectroscopy of incoherent light with sub-diffraction resolution. In a proof-of-principle experiment we analyze the spectrum of a pair of incoherent point-like sources whose separation is below the diffraction limit. The two sources mimic a planetary system, with a brighter source for the star and a dimmer one for the planet. Acquiring spectral information about the secondary source is hard because the two images have a substantial overlap. This limitation is solved by leveraging a structured measurement based on spatial-mode demultiplexing, where light is first sorted in its Hermite-Gaussian components in the transverse field, then measured by photon detection. This allows us to effectively decouple the photons coming from the two sources. An application is suggested to enhance exoplanets' atmosphere spectroscopy. A number of experiments of super-resolution imaging based on spatial demultiplexing have been conducted in the past few years, with promising results. Here, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we extend this concept to the domain of spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A Survey and Comparison of Post-quantum and Quantum Blockchains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains have gained substantial attention from academia and industry for their ability to facilitate decentralized trust and communications. However, the rapid progress of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of existing blockchain technologies. Notably, the emergence of Shor's and Grover's algorithms raises concerns regarding the compromise of the cryptographic systems underlying blockchains. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods that reinforce blockchain technology against quantum attacks. In response to this challenge, two distinct approaches have been proposed. The first approach involves post-quantum blockchains, which aim to utilize classical cryptographic algorithms resilient to quantum attacks. The second approach explores quantum blockchains, which leverage the power of quantum computers and networks to rebuild the foundations of blockchains. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and comparison of post-quantum and quantum blockchains while exploring open questions and remaining challenges in these domains. It offers an in-depth introduction, examines differences in blockchain structure, security, privacy, and other key factors, and concludes by discussing current research trends.</description>

      <title>Quantum panprotopsychism and the structure and subject-summing combination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we have shown that an ontology of quantum mechanics in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects, that is, a form of panprotopsychism, is well suited to explaining the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. We have proved there that the palette and grain combination problems of panpsychism and panprotopsychism arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience that are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. In this article, we address what is probably the first and most important combination problem of panpsychism: the subject-summing problem originally posed by William James. We begin by identifying the physical counterparts of the subjects of experience within the quantum panprotopsychic approach presented in that article. To achieve this, we turn to the notion of subject of experience inspired by the idea of prehension proposed by Whitehead and show that this notion can be adapted to the quantum ontology of objects and events. Due to the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics and its causal openness, this ontology also seems to be suitable for the analysis of the remaining aspects of the structure combination problem, which shows how the structuration of consciousness could have evolved from primitive animals to humans. The analysis imposes conditions on possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain and suggests new problems and strategies to address them. In particular, with regard to the structuring of experiences in animals with different degrees of evolutionary development.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Discrete Optimization: A Highlight of Three Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising frontier of quantum computing, providing novel numerical approaches to mathematical optimization problems. The main goal of this paper is to facilitate interdisciplinary research between the Operations Research (OR) and Quantum Computing communities by providing an OR scientist's perspective on selected quantum-powered methods for discrete optimization. To this end, we consider three quantum-powered optimization approaches that make use of different types of quantum hardware available on the market. To illustrate these approaches, we solve three classical optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Weighted Maximum Cut, and Maximum Independent Set. With a general OR audience in mind, we attempt to provide an intuition behind each approach along with key references, describe the corresponding high-level workflow, and highlight crucial practical considerations. In particular, we emphasize the importance of problem formulations and device-specific configurations, and their impact on the amount of resources required for computation (where we focus on the number of qubits). These points are illustrated with a series of experiments on three types of quantum computers: a neutral atom machine from QuEra, a quantum annealer from D-Wave, and a gate-based device from IBM.</description>

      <title>Non-linear steady states of subwavelength atomic arrays at low light intensities and beyond mean field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays constitute a novel light-matter platform with long-range interactions and collective dissipation that can host novel non-equilibrium many-body states. Here we investigate their steady states under coherent driving. While in the low-drive intensity regime they have often been described in terms of linear, non-interacting theories, we show that such a description is inadequate in subwavelength regimes. There, we point out that non-linearities can have large effects down to a vanishing drive intensity in the limit of large number of atoms. Then we investigate the role of fluctuations beyond Gutzwiller mean-field theory within a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) approach in the regime of intermediate drive intensity. We show that these have a dramatic impact on the steady-state phase diagram, including suppressing a range of non-homogeneous instabilities and phases predicted in mean-field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the full version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been systematized using Free Probability. In this paper, we present a detailed discussion of the Free Cumulants approach to many-body dynamics within the microcanonical ensemble. Differences between the later and canonical averages are known to manifest in the time-dependent fluctuations of extensive operators. Thus, the microcanonical ensemble is essential to extend the application of Free Probability to the broad class of extensive observables. We numerically demonstrate the validity of our approach in a non-integrable spin chain Hamiltonian for extensive observables at finite energy density. Our results confirm the full ETH properties, specifically the suppression of crossing contributions and the factorization of non-crossing ones, thus demonstrating that the microcanonical free cumulants encode ETH smooth correlations for both local and extensive observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration and long-range couplings are key contributors to create quantum phases with different properties throughout physics. We propose a scheme where both ingredients naturally emerge in a Raman induced subwavelength lattice. We first demonstrate that Raman-coupled multicomponent quantum gases can realize a highly versatile frustrated Hubbard Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. The deeply subwavelength lattice period leads to strong long-range interparticle repulsion with tunable range and decay. We numerically demonstrate that the combination of frustration and long-range couplings generates many-body phases of bosons, including a range of density-wave and superfluid phases with broken translational and time reversal symmetries, respectively. Our results thus represent a powerful approach for efficiently combining long-range interactions and frustration in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Towards a group structure for superluminal velocity boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical subluminal Lorentz boosts have a clear geometric interpretation. They can be neatly expressed as hyperbolic rotations, that leave both the family of $2$-sheet hyperboloids within the light cone, and the family $1$-sheet hyperboloids exterior to it, invariant. In this work, we construct a map between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding operators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot `jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least not classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself, generate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are discussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in $(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different way. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to existing models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts within a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology, that contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set containing both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results to higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Ab Initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics: Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra of Difluorocarbene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used with local harmonic approximation to partially capture the anharmonic effects on single vibronic level (SVL) spectra in model potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic anharmonic polyatomic molecules, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck--Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF$_2$, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <title>The Non-reciprocity of Multi-mode Optical Directional Amplifier Realized by Non-Hermitian Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a multi-frequency optical non-reciprocal transmission is first realized by using a non-Hermitian multi-mode resonator array.We find that the non-reciprocity can be used to route optical signals, to prevent the reverse flow of noise, and find that the multi-frequency can be used to enhance information processing. In terms of the Scully-Lamb model and gain saturation effect, we accomplish a dual-frequency non-reciprocal transmission by introducing nonlinearity into a linear array of four-mode resonators. For example, a directional cyclic amplifier is constructed with non-reciprocal units. As potential applications, the non-reciprocity optical systems can be employed in dual-frequency control, parallel information processing, photonic integrated circuits, optical devices and so on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Highly complex novel critical behavior from the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical measurements on critical ground states -- a controlled renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of weak measurements on the quantum critical ground state of the one-dimensional (a) tricritical and (b) critical quantum Ising model, by measuring in (a) the local energy and in (b) the local spin operator in a lattice formulation. By employing a controlled renormalization group (RG) analysis we find that each problem exhibits highly complex novel scaling behavior, arising from the intrinsically indeterministic ('random') nature of quantum mechanical measurements, which is governed by a measurement-dominated RG fixed point that we study within an $\epsilon$ expansion. In the tricritical Ising case (a) we find (i): multifractal scaling behavior of energy and spin correlations in the measured groundstate, corresponding to an infinite hierarchy of independent critical exponents and, equivalently, to a continuum of universal scaling exponents for each of these correlations; (ii): the presence of logarithmic factors multiplying powerlaws in correlation functions, a hallmark of 'logarithmic conformal field theories' (CFT); (iii): universal 'effective central charges' $c^{({\rm eff})}_n$ for the prefactors of the logarithm of subsystem size of the $n$th R\'enyi entropies, which are independent of each other for different $n$, in contrast to the unmeasured critical ground state, and (iv): a universal ("Affleck-Ludwig") 'effective boundary entropy' $S_{\rm{eff}}$ which we show, quite generally, to be related to the system-size independent part of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record, computed explicitly here to 1-loop order. - A subset of these results have so-far also been obtained within the $\epsilon$ expansion for the measurement-dominated critical point in the critical Ising case (b).</description>

      <description>arXiv:1712.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axiomatic theory of quantum first-kind measurements is developed in a rigorous form based on five Postulates. The measurement theory for observable with continuous spectrum is given in a rigged Hilbert space. This approach also describes the measurements with non-ideal initial conditions. It yields the survival effect in the position measurement of the particles. It is also found that there is no such survival effect in the momentum measurement of the particles. These Postulates of axiomatic theory yield the survival effect which violates the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. This theoretical result is demonstrated by the wave function with minimum of position and momentum uncertainty of the particle. The survival effect leads to essential corrections for the uncertainty relations. These modified uncertainty relations can also be used for the experimental verification of the survival measurement effect.</description>

Abstract: Periodically kicked Floquet systems such as the kicked rotor are a paradigmatic and illustrative simple model of chaos. For non-integrable quantum dynamics there are several diagnostic measures of the presence of (or the transition to) chaotic behaviour including the Loschmidt echo, autocorrelation function and OTOC. We analytically compute these measures in terms of the eigensystem of the unitary Floquet operator of driven quantum systems. We use these expressions to determine the time variation of the measures for the quantum kicked rotor on the torus, for the integrable as well as the chaotic case. For a simpler integrable variant of the kicked rotor, we also give a representation theoretic derivation of its dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Building a Quantum Internet requires the development of innovative quantum-enabling networking architectures that integrate advanced communication systems with long-distance quantum communication hardware. Here, we present the implementation of a quantum-enabled internet prototype using a novel physics-centric stack-based quantum network paradigm to govern the dynamics of multiple light-matter Hamiltonians across distant nodes. We demonstrate this concept using a deployed large-scale intercity quantum network connecting laboratories at Stony Brook University and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. This network facilitates a fundamental long-distance quantum network service -that of high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of telecom quantum states generated in two independent, telecom-compatible quantum light-matter interfaces separated by a distance of 158 km.</description>

Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers and simulators is likely to rely upon software-hardware co-design, with error-aware algorithms and protocols optimized for the platforms they are run on. Here, we show how knowledge of noise in a system can be exploited to improve the design of gate-based quantum simulation algorithms. We concretely demonstrate this co-design in the context of a trapped ion quantum simulation of the dynamics of a Heisenberg spin model. Specifically, we derive a theoretical noise model describing unitary gate errors due to heating of the ions' collective motion, finding that the temporal correlations in the noise induce an optimal gate depth. We then illustrate how tailored feedforward control can be used to mitigate unitary gate errors and improve the simulation outcome. Our results provide a practical guide to the co-design of gate-based quantum simulation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Iteration Complexity of Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in near-term applications of quantum computers, i.e., using quantum circuits that have short decoherence times due to hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA), wherein an optimization algorithm implemented on a classical computer evaluates a parametrized quantum circuit as an objective function, are a leading framework in this space. An enormous breadth of algorithms in this framework have been proposed for solving a range of problems in machine learning, forecasting, applied physics, and combinatorial optimization, among others.
  In this paper, we analyze the iteration complexity of VQA, that is, the number of steps that VQA requires until its iterates satisfy a surrogate measure of optimality. We argue that although VQA procedures incorporate algorithms that can, in the idealized case, be modeled as classic procedures in the optimization literature, the particular nature of noise in near-term devices invalidates the claim of applicability of off-the-shelf analyses of these algorithms. Specifically, noise makes the evaluations of the objective function via quantum circuits biased. Commonly used optimization procedures, such as SPSA and the parameter shift rule, can thus be seen as derivative-free optimization algorithms with biased function evaluations, for which there are currently no iteration complexity guarantees in the literature. We derive the missing guarantees and find that the rate of convergence is unaffected. However, the level of bias contributes unfavorably to both the constant therein, and the asymptotic distance to stationarity, i.e., the more bias, the farther one is guaranteed, at best, to reach a stationary point of the VQA objective.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced mean value estimation via adaptive measurement</title>

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced (i.e., higher performance by quantum effects than any classical methods) mean value estimation of observables is a fundamental task in various quantum technologies; in particular, it is an essential subroutine in quantum computing algorithms. Notably, the quantum estimation theory identifies the ultimate precision of such an estimator, which is referred to as the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao (QCR) lower bound or equivalently the inverse of the quantum Fisher information. Because the estimation precision directly determines the performance of those quantum technological systems, it is highly demanded to develop a generic and practically implementable estimation method that achieves the QCR bound. Under imperfect conditions, however, such an ultimate and implementable estimator for quantum mean values has not been developed. In this paper, we propose a quantum-enhanced mean value estimation method in a depolarizing noisy environment that asymptotically achieves the QCR bound in the limit of a large number of qubits. To approach the QCR bound in a practical setting, the method adaptively optimizes the amplitude amplification and a specific measurement that can be implemented without any knowledge of state preparation. We provide a rigorous analysis for the statistical properties of the proposed adaptive estimator such as consistency and asymptotic normality. Furthermore, several numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, particularly showing that the estimator needs only a modest number of measurements to almost saturate the QCR bound.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between quantum entanglement, geometrical and dynamical appearances in N spin-$1/2$ system under all-range Ising model</title>

Abstract: With the growth of geometric science, including the methods of exploring the world of information by means of modern geometry, there has always been a mysterious and fascinating ambiguous link between geometric, topological and dynamical characteristics with quantum entanglement. Since geometry studies the interrelations between elements such as distance and curvature, it provides the information sciences with powerful structures that yield practically useful and understandable descriptions of integrable quantum systems. We explore here these structures in a physical system of $N$ interaction spin-$1/2$ under all-range Ising model. By performing the system dynamics, we determine the Fubini-Study metric defining the relevant quantum state space. Applying Gaussian curvature within the scope of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we proved that the dynamics happens on a closed two-dimensional manifold having both a dumbbell-shape structure and a spherical topology. The geometric and topological phases appearing during the system evolution processes are sufficiently discussed. Subsequently, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem by achieving the time-optimal evolution. By restricting the whole system to a two spin-$1/2$ system, we investigate the relevant entanglement from two viewpoints; The first is of geometric nature and explores how the entanglement level affects derived geometric structures such as the Fubini-Study metric, the Gaussian curvature, and the geometric phase. The second is of dynamic nature and addresses the entanglement effect on the evolution speed and the related Fubini-Study distance. Further, depending on the degree of entanglement, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem.</description>

Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What would be the consequences if there were fundamental limits to our ability to experimentally explore the world? In this work we seriously consider this question. We assume the existence of statements whose truth value is not experimentally accessible. That is, there is no way, not even in theory, to directly test if these statements are true or false. We further develop a theory in which experimentally accessible statements are a union of a fixed minimum number of inaccessible statements. For example, the value of truth of the statements "a" and "b" is not accessible, but the value of truth of the statement "a or b" is accessible. We do not directly assume probability theory, we exclusively define experimentally accessible and inaccessible statements and build on these notions using the rules of classical logic. We find that an interesting structure emerges. Developing this theory, we relax the logical structure to a probabilistic one, obtaining a theory rich in structure that we call "theory of inaccessible information". Surprisingly, the simplest model of theory of inaccessible information is the qubit in quantum mechanics. Along the path for the construction of this theory, we characterise and study a family of multiplicative information measures that we call "inaccessibility measures".</description>

      <title>State-Blocking Side-Channel Attacks and Autonomous Fault Detection in Quantum Key Distribution</title>

Abstract: Side-channel attacks allow an Eavesdropper to use insecurities in the practical implementation of QKD systems to gain an advantage that is not considered by security proofs that assume perfect implementations. In this work we specify a side-channel capability for Eve that has yet to be considered, before then going on to discuss a scheme to autonomously detect such an attack during an ongoing QKD session, and the limits as to how fast a detection can be made. The side-channel capability is very general and covers a wide variety of possible implementations for the attack itself. We present how Alice and Bob can put in place a countermeasure to continue use of the QKD system, once a detection is made, regardless of the ongoing side-channel attack. This prevents downtime of QKD systems, which in critical infrastructure could pose severe risks. We then extend Eves side-channel capability and present a modified attack strategy. This strengthened attack can be detected under certain conditions by our scheme, however intelligent choices of parameters from Eve allow her strengthened attack to go undetected. From this, we discuss the implications this has on Privacy Amplification, and therefore on the security of QKD as a whole. Finally, consideration is given as to how these types of attacks are analogous to certain types of faults in the QKD system, how our detection scheme can also detect these faults, and therefore how this adds autonomous fault detection and redundancy to implementations of QKD.</description>

Abstract: The unavoidable interaction between thermal environments and quantum systems typically leads to the degradation of quantum coherence, which can be fought against by reservoir engineering. We propose the realization of a special mixture of thermal coherent states by coupling a thermal bath with a two-level system that is longitudinally coupled to a resonator. We find that the state of the resonator is a special mixture of two oppositely displaced thermal coherent states, whereas the two-level system remains thermal. This observation is verified by evaluating the second-order correlation coefficient for the resonator state. Moreover, we reveal the potential benefits of employing the mixture of thermal coherent states of the resonator in quantum thermometry. In this context, the resonator functions as a probe to measure the unknown temperature of a bath mediated by a two-level system, strategically bridging the connection between the two. Our results show that the use of an ancillary-assisted probe may broaden the applicable temperature range.</description>

      <title>Exponential Qubit Reduction in Optimization for Financial Transaction Settlement</title>

Abstract: We extend the qubit-efficient encoding presented in [Tan et al., Quantum 5, 454 (2021)] and apply it to instances of the financial transaction settlement problem constructed from data provided by a regulated financial exchange. Our methods are directly applicable to any QUBO problem with linear inequality constraints. Our extension of previously proposed methods consists of a simplification in varying the number of qubits used to encode correlations as well as a new class of variational circuits which incorporate symmetries, thereby reducing sampling overhead, improving numerical stability and recovering the expression of the cost objective as a Hermitian observable. We also propose optimality-preserving methods to reduce variance in real-world data and substitute continuous slack variables. We benchmark our methods against standard QAOA for problems consisting of 16 transactions and obtain competitive results. Our newly proposed variational ansatz performs best overall. We demonstrate tackling problems with 128 transactions on real quantum hardware, exceeding previous results bounded by NISQ hardware by almost two orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Flocks of animals represent a fascinating archetype of collective behavior in the macroscopic classical world, where the constituents, such as birds, concertedly perform motions and actions as if being one single entity. Here, we address the outstanding question of whether flocks can also form in the microscopic world at the quantum level. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of active quantum matter by formulating a class of models of active quantum particles on a one-dimensional lattice. We provide both analytical and large-scale numerical evidence that these systems can give rise to quantum flocks. A key finding is that these flocks, unlike classical ones, exhibit distinct quantum properties by developing strong quantum coherence over long distances. We propose that quantum flocks could be experimentally observed in Rydberg atom arrays. Our work paves the way towards realizing the intriguing collective behaviors of biological active particles in quantum matter systems. We expect that this opens up a path towards a yet totally unexplored class of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems with unique properties.</description>

      <title>A hybrid quantum-classical fusion neural network to improve protein-ligand binding affinity predictions for drug discovery</title>

Abstract: The field of drug discovery hinges on the accurate prediction of binding affinity between prospective drug molecules and target proteins, especially when such proteins directly influence disease progression. However, estimating binding affinity demands significant financial and computational resources. While state-of-the-art methodologies employ classical machine learning (ML) techniques, emerging hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) models have shown promise for enhanced performance, owing to their inherent parallelism and capacity to manage exponential increases in data dimensionality. Despite these advances, existing models encounter issues related to convergence stability and prediction accuracy. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model tailored for binding affinity prediction in drug discovery. Specifically, the proposed model synergistically integrates 3D and spatial graph convolutional neural networks within an optimized quantum architecture. Simulation results demonstrate a 6% improvement in prediction accuracy relative to existing classical models, as well as a significantly more stable convergence performance compared to previous classical approaches.</description>

Abstract: Coherent-population-trapping resonance is a quantum interference effect that appears in the two-photon transitions between the ground-state hyperfine levels of alkali atoms and is often utilized in miniature clock devices. To quantitatively understand and predict the performance of this phenomenon, it is necessary to consider the transitions and relaxations between all hyperfine Zeeman sublevels involved in the different excitation processes of the atom. In this study, we constructed a computational multi-level atomic model of the Liouville density-matrix equation for 32 Zeeman sublevels involved in the $D_1$ line of $^{133}$Cs irradiated by two frequencies with circularly polarized components and then simulated the amplitude and shape of the transmitted light through a Cs vapor cell. We show that the numerical solutions of the equation and analytical investigations adequately explain a variety of the characteristics observed in the experiment.</description>

      <title>A Lie Algebraic Theory of Barren Plateaus for Deep Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum computing schemes train a loss function by sending an initial state through a parametrized quantum circuit, and measuring the expectation value of some operator. Despite their promise, the trainability of these algorithms is hindered by barren plateaus (BPs) induced by the expressiveness of the circuit, the entanglement of the input data, the locality of the observable, or the presence of noise. Up to this point, these sources of BPs have been regarded as independent. In this work, we present a general Lie algebraic theory that provides an exact expression for the variance of the loss function of sufficiently deep parametrized quantum circuits, even in the presence of certain noise models. Our results allow us to understand under one framework all aforementioned sources of BPs. This theoretical leap resolves a standing conjecture about a connection between loss concentration and the dimension of the Lie algebra of the circuit's generators.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates the existence of an evanescent electron wave outside both finite and infinite quantum wells by solving the Dirac equation and ensuring the continuity of the spinor wavefunction at the boundaries. We show that this evanescent wave shares the spin characteristics of the wave confined within the well, as indicated by analytical expressions for the current density across all regions. Our findings suggest that the electron cannot be confined to a mathematical singularity and that quantum information, or quantum entropy, can leak through any confinement. These results emphasize that the electron wave, fully characterized by Lorentz-invariant charge and current densities, should be considered the true and sole entity of the electron.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.</description>

      <title>Purity-Assisted Zero-Noise Extrapolation for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation aims to reduce errors in quantum systems and improve accuracy. Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a commonly used method, where noise is amplified, and the target expectation is extrapolated to a noise-free point. However, ZNE relies on assumptions about error rates based on the error model. In this study, a purity-assisted zero-noise extrapolation (pZNE) method is utilized to address limitations in error rate assumptions and enhance the extrapolation process. The pZNE is based on the Pauli diagonal error model implemented using the Pauli twirling technique. Although this method does not significantly reduce the bias of routine ZNE, it extends its effectiveness to a wider range of error rates where routine ZNE may face limitations. In addition, the practicality of the pZNE method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments on the online quantum computation platform, Quafu. Comparisons with routine ZNE and virtual distillation methods show that biases in extrapolation methods increase with error rates and may become divergent at high error rates. The bias of pZNE is slightly lower than routine ZNE, while its error rate threshold surpasses that of routine ZNE. Furthermore, for full density matrix information, the pZNE method is more efficient than the routine ZNE.</description>

      <title>Exact zeros of fidelity in finite-size systems as a signature for probing quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fidelity is widely used to detect quantum phase transitions, which is characterized by either a sharp change of fidelity or the divergence of fidelity susceptibility in the thermodynamical limit when the phase-driving parameter is across the transition point. In this work, we unveil that the occurrence of exact zeros of fidelity in finite-size systems can be applied to detect quantum phase transitions. In general, the fidelity $\mathcal{F}(\gamma,\tilde{\gamma})$ always approaches zero in the thermodynamical limit, due to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe, no matter whether the parameters of two ground states ($\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$) are in the same phase or different phases, and this makes it difficult to distinguish whether an exact zero of fidelity exists by finite-size analysis. To overcome the influence of orthogonality catastrophe, we study finite-size systems with twist boundary conditions, which can be introduced by applying a magnetic flux, and demonstrate that exact zeros of fidelity can be always accessed by tuning the magnetic flux when $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ belong to different phases. On the other hand, no exact zero of fidelity can be observed if $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ are in the same phase. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical scheme by studying concrete examples, including the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Creutz model and Haldane model. Our work provides a practicable way to detect quantum phase transitions via the calculation of fidelity of finite-size systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum decision theory is introduced here, and a new basis for this theory is proposed. It is first based upon the author's general arguments for the Hilbert space formalism in quantum theory, and next on arguments for the Born rule, that is, the basis for calculating quantum probabilities. A basic notion behind the quantum theory foundation is that of theoretical variables, that are divided into accessible and inaccessible ones. This is here specialized to decision variables. It is assumed that each accessible variable can be seen as a function of a specific inaccessible variable. Another assumption is that there exist two maximal accessible theoretical variables in the given situation. Two basic assumptions behind the Born rule are 1) the likelihood principle, 2) the actor in question has motivations that can be modeled by a hypothetical perfectly rational higher being. The theory is illustrated by a medical example. Finally, a broad discussion of decision processes is given.</description>

      <title>Smooth Crossover Between Weak and Strong Thermalization using Rigorous Bounds on Equilibration of Isolated Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is usually expected and observed that non-integrable isolated quantum systems thermalize. However, for some non-integrable spin chain models, in a numerical study, initial states with oscillations that persisted for some time were found and the phenomenon was named weak thermalization. Later, it was argued that such oscillations will eventually decay suggesting that weak thermalization was about time scales and not the size of the fluctuations. Nevertheless, the analyses of the size of the fluctuations were more qualitative. Here, using exact diagonalization we analyze how the size of the typical fluctuation, after long enough time for equilibration to happen, scales with the system size. For that, we use rigorous mathematical upper bounds on the equilibration of isolated quantum systems. We show that weak thermalization can be understood to be due to the small effective dimension of the initial state. Furthermore, we show that the fluctuations decay exponentially with the system size for both weak and strong thermalization indicating no sharp transitions between these two regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak values of quantum observables are a powerful tool for investigating quantum phenomena. Some methods for measuring weak values in the laboratory require weak interactions and postselection, while others are deterministic, but require statistics over a number of experiments that grows linearly with the dimension of the measured system in the worst case over all possible observables. Here we propose a deterministic dimension-independent scheme for estimating weak values of arbitrary observables. The scheme is based on controlled SWAP operations, and associates states and observables in the mathematical expression of the weak value to preparations devices and measurements devices in the experimental setup, respectively. Thanks to this feature, it provides insights into the relation between states of two identical quantum systems at a single moment of time and states of a single quantum system at two moments of time, also known as two-time states. Specifically, our scheme provides an alternative expression for two-time states, and establishes a link between two-time states accessible through the controlled-SWAP scheme and bipartite quantum states with positive partial transpose.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation via single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a main bus. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces. Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial, and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W states, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing parameter $\xi_R^2\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL). Our finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into simply switching on/off microwave. It has direct applications in the variational quantum optimizer which is available with existing technology.</description>

      <title>Fast Numerical Solver of Ising Optimization Problems via Pruning and Domain Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealers, coherent Ising machines and digital Ising machines for solving quantum-inspired optimization problems have been developing rapidly due to their near-term applications. The numerical solvers of the digital Ising machines are based on traditional computing devices. In this work, we propose a fast and efficient solver for the Ising optimization problems. The algorithm consists of a pruning method that exploits the graph information of the Ising model to reduce the computational complexity, and a domain selection method which introduces significant acceleration by relaxing the discrete feasible domain into a continuous one to incorporate the efficient gradient descent method. The experiment results show that our solver can be an order of magnitude faster than the classical solver, and at least two times faster than the quantum-inspired annealers including the simulated quantum annealing on the benchmark problems. With more relaxed requirements on hardware and lower cost than quantum annealing, the proposed solver has the potential for near-term application in solving challenging optimization problems as well as serving as a benchmark for evaluating the advantage of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Statistical and dynamical aspects of quantum chaos in a kicked Bose-Hubbard dimer</title>

Abstract: Systems of interacting bosons in double-well potentials, modeled by two-site Bose-Hubbard models, are of significant theoretical and experimental interest and attracted intensive studies in contexts ranging from many-body physics and quantum dynamics to the onset of quantum chaos. In this work we systematically study a kicked two-site Bose-Hubbard model (Bose-Hubbard dimer) with the on-site potential difference being periodically modulated. Our model can be equivalently represented as a kicked Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and thus displays different dynamical behaviors from the kicked top model. By analyzing spectral statistics of Floquet operator, we unveil that the system undergoes a transition from regularity to chaos with increasing the interaction strength. Then based on semiclassical approximation and the analysis of R\'{e}nyi entropy of coherent states in the basis of Floquet operator eigenstates, we reveal the local chaotic features of our model, which indicate the existence of integrable islands even in the deep chaotic regime. The semiclassical analysis also suggests that the system in chaotic regime may display different dynamical behavior depending on the choice of initial states. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamical signatures of chaos can be manifested by studying dynamical evolution of local operators and out of time order correlation function as well as the entanglement entropy. Our numerical results exhibit the richness of dynamics of the kicked Bose-Hubbard dimer in both regular and chaotic regimes as the initial states are chosen as coherent spin states located in different locations of phase space.</description>

Abstract: The quantum repeater cell is a basic building block for a quantum network, as it allows to overcome the distance limitations due to unavoidable fiber loss in direct transmission. We demonstrate the implementation of a quantum repeater cell, based on two free-space coupled $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in the same trap that act as quantum memories. We demonstrate the asynchronous generation of atom-photon and photon-photon entanglement by controlled emission of single photons from the individually addressed ions and entanglement swapping. We discuss the fidelity as well as the scaling of the generated rate.</description>

      <title>Workflow for practical quantum chemical calculations with quantum phase estimation algorithm: electronic ground and {\pi}-{\pi}* excited states of benzene and its derivatives{\dag}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to perform the full-configuration interaction calculations with less computational resources compared to classical ones, thanks to the use of the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithms. However, only a limited number of the QPE-based quantum chemical calculations have been reported even for numerical simulations on a classical computer, and the practical workflow for the QPE computation has not yet been established. In this paper, we report the QPE simulations of the electronic ground and the {\pi}-{\pi}* excited singlet state of benzene and its chloro- and nitroderivatives as the representative industrially important systems, with the aid of GPGPU acceleration of quantum circuit simulations. We adopted the pseudo-natural orbitals obtained from the MP2 calculation as the basis for the wave function expansion, the CISD calculation within the active space to find the main electronic configurations to be included in the input wave function of the excited state, and the technique to reduce the truncation error the calculated total energies. The proposed computational workflow is easily applicable to other molecules and can be a standard approach for performing the QPE-based quantum chemical calculations of practical molecules.</description>

      <title>Local certification of unitary operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the local certification of unitary quantum channels, which is a natural extension of quantum hypothesis testing. A particular case of a quantum channel operating on two systems corresponding to product states at the input, is considered. The goal is to minimize the probability of the type II error, given a specified maximum probability of the type I error, considering assistance through entanglement with auxiliary systems. Our result indicates connection of the local certification problem with a product numerical range of unitary matrices. We show that the optimal local strategy does not need usage of auxiliary systems and requires only single round of one-way classical communication. Moreover, we compare local and global certification strategies and show that typically local strategies are optimal, yet in some extremal cases, where global strategies make no errors, local ones may fail miserably. Finally, some application for local certification of von Neumann measurements are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>The polygon relation and subadditivity of entropic measures for discrete and continuous multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [Ge {\it et al.}, arXiv: 2312. 17496 (2023)], we have derived the polygon relation of bipartite entanglement measures that is useful to reveal the entanglement properties of discrete, continuous, and even hybrid multipartite quantum systems. In this work, with the information-theoretical measures of R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we study the relationship between the polygon relation and the subadditivity of entropy. In particular, the entropy-polygon relations are derived for pure multi-qubit states and generalized to multi-mode Gaussian states, by utilizing the known results from the quantum marginal problem. Moreover, the equivalence between the polygon relation and subadditivity is established, in the sense that for all discrete or continuous multipartite states, the polygon relation holds if and only if the underlying entropy is subadditive. As byproduct, the subadditivity of R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies is proven for all bipartite Gaussian states. Finally, the difference between polygon relations and monogamy relations is clarified, and generalizations of our results are discussed. Our work provides a better understanding of the rich structure of multipartite states, and hence is expected to be helpful for the study of multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary gauge transformation (IGT) provides a clear understanding of the non-Hermitian skin effect by transforming the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra into Hermitian ones. In this paper, we extend this approach to the complex spectrum regime in a general nonreciprocal lattice model. We unveil the validity of IGT hinges on a class of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. The generalized Brillouin zone of Hamiltonians respect such pseudo-Hermiticity is demonstrated to be a circle, which enables easy access to the continuum bands, localization length of skin modes, and relevant topological numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of IGT and the underlying pseudo-Hermiticity beyond nearest-neighbor hopping, offering a graphical interpretation. Our theoretical framework is applied to establish bulk-boundary correspondence in the nonreciprocal trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and to analyze the localization behaviors of skin modes in the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in cosmic string spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement harvesting phenomenon for static detectors that locally interact with massless scalar fields in the cosmic string spacetime, which, though locally flat, features a conical structure defined by a deficit angle. Specifically, we analyze three detector alignments relative to the string: parallel and orthogonal alignments with detectors on the same side of the string, and an orthogonal alignment with detectors on opposite sides of the string. For the alignments on the same side of the string, we observe that the cosmic string's presence can either aid or hinder entanglement harvesting, affecting both the extent of entanglement harvested and the achievable range of interdetector separation. This effect depends on the distance between the detectors and the string and differs markedly from scenarios in a locally flat spacetime with a reflecting boundary, where the boundary invariably extends the harvesting-achievable range. Conversely, for the alignment with detectors on opposite sides of the string, we find that detectors consistently harvest more entanglement than those in a flat spacetime devoid of a cosmic string. This starkly contrasts the behavior observed with detectors on the same side. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic string expands the harvesting-achievable range for detectors in orthogonal alignment only when near the string, whereas it invariably reduces the achievable range for detectors in parallel alignment.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and tripartite steering in three-qubit pure states induced by vacuum--one-photon superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing a tritter with variable parameter $T$ and induced by vacuum--one-photon superpositions $\left\vert 0\right\rangle +\alpha\left\vert 1\right\rangle $ with $\alpha =\left\vert \alpha \right\vert e^{i\phi }$, we propose a scheme to prepare a class of three-qubit pure states. These states take the form of $\left\vert \psi \right\rangle _{123}=c_{0}\left\vert 000\right\rangle +c_{1}\left\vert 100\right\rangle +c_{2}\left\vert 010\right\rangle +c_{3}\left\vert 001\right\rangle $. The coefficients ($c_{0}$, $c_{1}$, $c_{2}$, and $c_{3}$) can be manipulated through interaction parameters ($\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $, $\phi $, and $T$). In line with Xie and Eberly's work[Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 040403 (2021)], we investigate the genuine tripartite entanglement for $\left\vert \psi \right\rangle _{123}$ by using the measure of concurrence fill. Drawing on Hao \textit{et al.}'s research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 120402 (2021)], we examine tripartite steering for $\left\vert \psi \right\rangle _{123}$ under certain measurements based on the uncertainty relations criterion. We identify nine potential configurations exhibiting varying steerability across different parameter spaces. It is important to highlight that, while the state $\left\vert \psi \right\rangle _{123}$ exhibits entanglement, steering remains unattainable in a substantial portion of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and mid-circuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities $q=p/L^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as $p$ increases when $\alpha=1$. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first-order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When $\alpha \neq 1$, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of $p$ and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Complementary Relationships between Entanglement and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complementary relationships exist regarding interference properties of particles such as pattern visibility, predictability and distinguishability. Additionally, relationships are known between information gain $G$ and measurement disturbance $F$ for entangled spin pairs. The question of whether a similar complementary relationship between entanglement and measurement occurs is examined herein. For qubit systems, both measurement on a single system and measurements on a bipartite system are considered in regards to the entanglement. It is proven that $\overline{E}+D\le 1$ holds where $\overline{E}$ is the average entanglement after a measurement is made and for which $D$ is a measure of the measurement disturbance of a single measurement. For measurements on a bipartite system shared by Alice and Bob ,it is shown that $\overline{E}+\overline{G}\le 1$ where $\overline{G}$ is the maximum average information gain regarding Alice's result that can be obtained by Bob. These results are generalized for arbitrary initial mixed states and as well to non-Hermitian operators. In the case of maximally entangled initial states, it is found that $D\le E_{L}$ and $\overline{G}\le E_{L}$ where $E_{L}$ is the entanglement loss due to measurement by Alice. We conclude that the amount of disturbance and information gain that one can gain are strictly limited by entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of noise in current near-term quantum devices is of paramount importance to fully use their computational power. However, direct quantum process tomography becomes unfeasible for systems composed of tens of qubits. A promising alternative method based on tensor networks was recently proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 2858 (2023)]. In this paper, we adapt it for the characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20 qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.</description>

Abstract: We propose energy-saving fast-forward scaling. Fast-forward scaling is a method which enables us to speed up (or slow down) given dynamics in a certain measurement basis. We introduce energy costs of fast-forward scaling, and find possibility of energy-saving speedup for time-independent measurement bases. As concrete examples, we show such energy-saving fast-forward scaling in a two-level system and quantum annealing of a general Ising spin glass. We also discuss the influence of a time-dependent measurement basis, and give a remedy for unwanted energy costs. The present results pave the way for realization of energy-efficient quantum technologies.</description>

State vector simulation utilizes CPU and memory resources in computing nodes exponentially with respect to the number of qubits; furthermore, in a variational quantum algorithm, the large number of repeated runs by classical optimization is also a heavy load. This problem has been addressed by preparing numerous computing nodes or simulation frameworks that work effectively. This study aimed to accelerate quantum simulation using two newly proposed methods: to efficiently utilize limited computational resources by adjusting the ratio of the MPI and distributed processing parallelism corresponding to the target problem settings and to slim down the Hamiltonian by considering the effect of accuracy on the calculation result. Ground-state energy calculations of fermionic model were performed using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on an HPC cluster with up to 1024 FUJITSU Processor A64FX connected to each other by InfiniBand; the processor is also used on supercomputer Fugaku. We achieved 200 times higher speed over VQE simulations and demonstrated 32 qubits ground-state energy calculations in acceptable time. This result indicates that &gt; 30 qubit state vector simulations can be realistically utilized to further research on variational quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative characterization of two-qubit entanglement purification protocols is introduced. Our approach is based on the concurrence and the hit-and-run algorithm applied to the convex set of all two-qubit states. We demonstrate that pioneering protocols are unable to improve the estimated initial average concurrence of almost uniformly sampled density matrices, however, as it is known, they still generate pairs of qubits in a state that is close to a Bell state. We also develop a more efficient protocol and investigate it numerically together with a recent proposal based on an entangling rank-$2$ projector. Furthermore, we present a class of variational purification protocols with continuous parameters and optimize their output concurrence. These optimized algorithms turn out to surpass former proposals and our protocol by means of not wasting too many entangled states.</description>

      <title>Effect of the readout efficiency of quantum measurement on the system entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems evolve along stochastic trajectories correlated with the observer's knowledge of the system's state. Under such dynamics, certain quantum resources like entanglement may depend on the observer's state of knowledge. Here, we quantify the entanglement for a particle on a 1d quantum random walk under inefficient monitoring using a mixed state-entanglement measure - the configuration coherence. We find that the system's maximal mean entanglement at the measurement-induced quantum-to-classical crossover is suppressed in different ways by the measurement strength and inefficiency. In principle, strong measurements can lower the amount of entanglement indefinitely. However, at a given measurement strength, efficient readout can crucially increase the system entanglement, making high-fidelity detectors essential for successful quantum computing. Our results bear impact for a broad range of fields, ranging from quantum simulation platforms of random walks to questions related to measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of quantum channels in general probabilistic theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum theory, there exist sets of operations that cannot be performed simultaneously. These sets of operations are referred to as incompatible. While this definition of incompatibility extends to general probabilistic theories (GPTs), the dependency of the set of compatible sets on the definition of composite systems has not been thoroughly investigated. For quantum channels, compatibility is defined using the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, based on the conventional composite system. However, in GPTs, composite systems are not uniquely defined, and the set of states can vary from the minimal tensor to the maximal tensor. In this paper, in addition to the usual quantum compatibility, we introduce min-tensor-compatibility using the minimal tensor on the composite system of effect spaces and investigate their relationship employing noisy identity channels on qubits. As a result, we found that the set of min-tensor-compatible channel pairs is strictly broader than the set of quantum-compatible channel pairs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of almost quantum compatible pairs of channels from an operational perspective. This concept corresponds to cases where the correlation functions in the verification of compatibility can be realized through a channel and local reinterpretation of effects. We demonstrate that the set of all almost quantum compatible channel pairs is strictly narrower than the set of all min-tensor-compatible channel pairs.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the superior capabilities of the recently proposed Lorentz quantum computer (LQC) compared to conventional quantum computers. We introduce an associated computational complexity class termed bounded-error Lorentz quantum polynomial-time (BLQP), demonstrating its equivalence to the complexity class ${\text P}^{\sharp \text{P}}$. We present LQC algorithms that efficiently solve the problem of maximum independent set, PP (probabilistic polynomial-time), and consequently ${\text P}^{\sharp \text{P}}$, all within polynomial time. Additionally, we show that the quantum computing with postselection proposed by Aaronson can be efficiently simulated by LQC, but not vice versa.</description>

      <title>Strict hierarchy of optimal strategies for global estimations: Linking global estimations with local ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial yet challenging issue in quantum metrology is to ascertain the ultimate precision achievable in estimation strategies. While there are two paradigms of estimations, local and global, current research is largely confined to local estimations, which are useful once the parameter of interest is approximately known. In this Letter we target a paradigm shift towards global estimations, which can operate reliably even with a few measurement data and no substantial prior knowledge about the parameter. The key innovation here is to develop a technique, dubbed virtual imaginary time evolution, which establishes an equality between the information gained in a global estimation and the quantum Fisher information for a virtual local estimation. This offers an intriguing pathway to surmount challenges in the realm of global estimations by leveraging powerful tools tailored for local estimations. We explore our technique to reveal a strict hierarchy of achievable precision for different global estimation strategies and uncover unexpected results contrary to conventional wisdom in local estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) has emerged as a pivotal promising approach for electronic structure challenges in quantum chemistry with noisy quantum devices. Nevertheless, to surmount existing technological constraints, this study endeavors to enhance ADAPT-VQE's efficacy. Leveraging insights from electronic structure theory, we concentrate on optimizing state preparation without added computational burden and guiding ansatz expansion to yield more concise wavefunctions with expedited convergence toward exact solutions. These advancements culminate in shallower circuits and, as demonstrated, reduced measurement requirements. This research delineates these enhancements and assesses their performance across mono, di, and tridimensional arrangements of H4 models, as well as in the water molecule. Ultimately, this work attests to the viability of physically-motivated strategies in fortifying ADAPT-VQE's efficiency, marking a significant stride in quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

Therefore any element from each of these sets can always be approximated by diagonalizable elements of the same set to arbitrary precision.</description>

Abstract: The so-called ``adiabatic elimination'' of fast decaying degrees of freedom in open quantum systems can be performed with a series expansion in the timescale separation. The associated computations are significantly more difficult when the remaining degrees of freedom (center manifold) follow fast unitary dynamics instead of just being slow. This paper highlights how a formulation with Sylvester's equation and with adjoint dynamics leads to systematic, explicit expressions at high orders for settings of physical interest.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the multimode nature of single-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are necessary components for many prospective quantum technologies. One candidate for a single-photon source is spontaneous parametric down conversion combined with a heralding photon detection. The heralded light pulse from such a source, is typically treated as single-mode, this treatment, however, is incomplete. We develop a full multimode description based on the exact Bogoliubov treatment of the down conversion process. We then provide a perturbative and effective treatment, which illustrates the most important physical mechanisms and permits analytical estimates of the success probability and purity of single-photon states under practical heralding conditions, both without relying on the precise detection time of the heralding photon and when accepting photons only in a narrow window around the time of the detection. This permits us to characterize the emitted light under three different assumptions for the pump pulse. For spontaneous parametric down conversion with a very short pump pulse, we find the single-mode description to be accurate, while for longer pump pulses and continuous pumping, a multimode description is necessary. Our findings can be used to guide the design of quantum information protocols based on heralded single-photon sources, as their performance may depend on the multimode nature of the sources.</description>

      <title>Unitary Synthesis of Clifford+T Circuits with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for synthesizing unitaries into quantum circuits. Unitary synthesis aims to identify a quantum circuit that represents a given unitary while minimizing circuit depth, total gate count, a specific gate count, or a combination of these factors. While past research has focused predominantly on continuous gate sets, synthesizing unitaries from the parameter-free Clifford+T gate set remains a challenge. Although the time complexity of this task will inevitably remain exponential in the number of qubits for general unitaries, reducing the runtime for simple problem instances still poses a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the tree-search method Gumbel AlphaZero to solve the problem for a subset of exactly synthesizable Clifford+T unitaries. Our method effectively synthesizes circuits for up to five qubits generated from randomized circuits with up to 60 gates, outperforming existing tools like QuantumCircuitOpt and MIN-T-SYNTH in terms of synthesis time for larger qubit counts. Furthermore, it surpasses Synthetiq in successfully synthesizing random, exactly synthesizable unitaries. These results establish a strong baseline for future unitary synthesis algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a numerical investigation of the dynamics of the central spin model in the presence of measurement processes. This model holds promise for experimental exploration due to its topology, which facilitates the natural distinction of a central particle and the quantum bath as different subsystems, allowing for the examination of entanglement phase transitions. To characterize the measurement-induced phase transition in this system, we employ a recently developed method based on second R\'enyi entropy in dual space. Our simulations account for decoherence, energy relaxation, and gate errors. We determine critical measurement rates and demonstrate that they significantly differ from those predicted by a simple approach based on mutual entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>A SAT Scalpel for Lattice Surgery: Representation and Synthesis of Subroutines for Surface-Code Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary for large-scale quantum computing. A promising quantum error correcting code is the surface code. For this code, fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e., splitting and merging patches of code. Given the frequent use of certain lattice-surgery subroutines (LaS), it becomes crucial to optimize their design in order to minimize the overall spacetime volume of FTQC. In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume. For example, it achieves 8% and 18% volume reduction respectively over two states-of-the-art human designs for the 15-to-1 T-factory, a bottleneck in FTQC.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new quantum circuit synthesis (QCS) framework, Qsyn, for developers to research, develop, test, experiment, and then contribute their QCS algorithms and tools to the framework. Our framework is more developer-friendly than other modern QCS frameworks in three aspects: (1) We design a rich command-line interface so that developers can easily design various testing scenarios and flexibly conduct experiments on their algorithms. (2) We offer detailed access to many data representations on different abstract levels of quantum circuits so that developers can optimize their algorithms to the extreme. (3) We define a rigid developing flow and environment so that developers can ensure their development qualities with the best modern software engineering practices.

      <title>Permissible four-strategy quantum extensions of classical games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study focuses on strategic-form games extended in the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein scheme by two unitary operations. Conditions are determined under which the pair of unitary operators, along with classical strategies, form a game invariant under isomorphic transformations of the input classical game. These conditions are then applied to determine these operators, resulting in five main classes of games satisfying the isomorphism criterion, and a theorem is proved providing a practical criterion for this isomorphism. The interdependencies between different classes of extensions are identified, including limit cases in which one class transforms into another.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how squeezing techniques can improve the measurement precision in multiphase quantum metrology. While these methods are well-studied and effectively used in single-phase estimations, their usage in multiphase situations has yet to be examined. We fill this gap by investigating the mechanism of quantum enhancement in the multiphase scenarios. Our analysis provides theoretical and numerical insights into the optimal condition for achieving the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, helping us understand the potential and mechanism for quantum-enhanced multiphase estimations with squeezing. This research opens up new possibilities for advancements in quantum metrology and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-swapping in generalised probabilistic theories, and iterated CHSH games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there exist theories that have states "more strongly entangled" than quantum theory, in the sense that they show CHSH values above Tsirelson's bound, all known examples of such theories have a strictly smaller set of measurements. Therefore, in tasks which require both bipartite states and measurements, they do not perform better than QM. One of the simplest information processing tasks involving both bipartite states and measurements is that of entanglement swapping. In this paper, we study entanglement swapping in generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, we introduce the iterated CHSH game, which measures the power of a GPT to preserve non-classical correlations, in terms of the largest CHSH value obtainable after $n$ rounds of entanglement swapping. Our main result is the construction of a GPT that achieves a CHSH value of $4$ after an arbitrary number of rounds. This addresses a question about the optimality of quantum theory for such games recently raised by Weilenmann and Colbeck. One challenge faced when treating this problem is that there seems to be no general framework for constructing GPTs in which entanglement swapping is a well-defined operation. Therefore, we introduce an algorithmic construction that turns a bipartite GPT into a multipartite GPT that supports entanglement swapping, if consistently possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum Self-Propulsion of an Inhomogeneous Object out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we explored how quantum vacuum torque can arise: a body or nanoparticle that is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment experiences a spontaneous torque. But this requires that the body be composed of nonreciprocal material, which seems to necessitate the presence of an external influence, such as a magnetic field. Then the electric polarizability of the particle has a real part that is nonsymmetric. This effect occurs to first order in the polarizability. To that order, no self-propulsive force can arise. Here, we consider second-order effects, and show that spontaneous forces can arise in vacuum, without requiring exotic electromagnetic properties. Thermal nonequilibrium is still necessary, but the electric susceptibility of the body need only be inhomogeneous. We investigate four examples of such a body: a needle composed of distinct halves; a sphere and a ball, each hemisphere being made of a different substance; and a thin slab, each face of which is different. The results found are consistent with previous numerical investigations. Here, we take into account the skin depth of metal surfaces. We also consider the frictional forces that would cause the body to acquire a terminal velocity, which might be observable. More likely to be important is relaxation to thermal equilibrium, which can still lead to a terminal velocity that might be experimentally verifiable. A general treatment of such forces on a moving body, expressed in momentum space, is provided, which incorporates both propulsive and frictional forces. The source of the propulsive force is the nonsymmetric pattern of radiation from different parts of the body, the higher reflectivity of the metal portion playing a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Remote Implementation of Hidden or Partially Unknown Quantum Operators using Optimal Resources: A Generalized View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two protocols are proposed for two closely linked but different variants of remote implementation of quantum operators of specific forms. The first protocol is designed for the remote implementation of the single qubit hidden quantum operator, whereas the second one is designed for the remote implementation of the partially unknown single qubit quantum operator. In both cases two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is entangled in the spatial degree of freedom is used. The quantum resources used here are optimal and easy to realize and maintain in comparison to the multi-partite or multi-mode entangled states used in earlier works. The impact of photon loss due to interaction with the environment is analyzed for both the schemes. The proposed protocols are also generalized to their controlled, bidirectional, cyclic, controlled cyclic, and controlled bidirectional versions and it is shown that either Bell state alone or products of Bell states will be sufficient to perform these tasks with some additional classical communications in the controlled cases only. This is in sharp contrast to the earlier proposals that require large entangled states. In addition, it's noted that remote implementation of hidden or partially unknown operators involving multiple controllers and/or multiple players who jointly apply the desired operator(s) would require quantum channels more complex than the Bell states and their products. Explicit forms of such quantum channels are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrafast quantum dynamics of photophysical processes in complex molecules is an extremely challenging computational problem with a wide variety of fascinating applications in quantum chemistry and biology. Inspired by recent developments in open quantum systems, we introduce a pure-state unraveled hybrid-bath method that describes a continuous environment via a set of discrete, effective bosonic degrees of freedom using a Markovian embedding. Our method is capable of describing both, a continuous spectral density and sharp peaks embedded into it. Thereby, we overcome the limitations of previous methods, which either capture long-time memory effects using the unitary dynamics of a set of discrete vibrational modes or use memoryless Markovian environments employing a Lindblad or Redfield master equation. We benchmark our method against two paradigmatic problems from quantum chemistry and biology. We demonstrate that compared to unitary descriptions, a significantly smaller number of bosonic modes suffices to describe the excitonic dynamics accurately, yielding a computational speed-up of nearly an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we take into account explicitly the effect of a $\delta$-peak in the spectral density of a light-harvesting complex, demonstrating the strong impact of the long-time memory of the environment on the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel quantum battery realized with a few interacting particles in a three-well system with different on-site energies, which could be realized with ultracold atom platforms. We prepare the initial state in the lowest energy well and charge the battery using a Spatial Adiabatic Passage (SAP)-based protocol, enabling the population of a higher energy well. We examine the charging under varying interaction strengths and reveal that the consideration of collective charging results in an intriguing oscillatory behavior of the final charge for finite interactions, through diabatic evolution. Our findings open a new avenue for building stable and controllable quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable entanglement distribution network suitable for connecting multiple ground nodes with a satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-based quantum communication channels are important for ultra-long distances. Given the short duration of a satellite pass, it can be challenging to efficiently connect multiple users of a city-wide network while the satellite is passing over that area. We propose a network with dual-functionality: during a brief satellite pass, the ground network is configured as a multipoint-to-point topology where all ground nodes establish entanglement with a satellite receiver. During times when this satellite is not available, the satellite up-link is rerouted via a single optical switch to the ground nodes, and the network is configured as a pair-wise ground network. We numerically simulate a pulsed hyper-entangled photon source and study the performance of the proposed network configurations for quantum key distribution. We find favourable scaling in the case that the satellite receiver exploits time-multiplexing whereas the ground nodes utilize frequency-multiplexing. The scalability, simple reconfigurability, and easy integration with fibre networks make this architecture a promising candidate for quantum communication of many ground nodes and a satellite, thus paving the way towards interconnection of ground nodes at a global scale.</description>

Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computation to prepare a quantum state for a given classical description of the quantum state. The classical description of an $n$-qubit quantum state may have $\exp(O(n))$ parameters in general, which are inherently inefficient to deal with in the worst case; however, in many practical cases, we may be able to employ suitable data structures to represent such large-scale data in a compressed way, e.g., by using a free binary decision diagram (FBDD), a rooted directed acyclic graph with two terminal nodes to concisely represent a Boolean function. We here construct a quantum algorithm for QSP when the classical description of a quantum state is given by an FBDD with weighted edges, and analyze the space, and time complexity of QSP in this setting. We provide a nontrivial example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ nodes rather than $\mathrm{exp}(O(n))$. We show that any quantum state represented by the weighted FBDD with $N$ nodes can be prepared by an $O(N)$-sized quantum circuit using $N$ ancillary qubits, exponentially improving the required circuit size for QSP compared to other BDD-based QSPs. We also provide another example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(n^2)$ nodes, and $O(n^2)$ ancillary qubits, but cannot be prepared efficiently by a QSP based on the amplitude amplification. These results provide techniques to employ FBDDs as a tool for broadening the possibility of efficient QSP.</description>

Abstract: The Born rule asserts the probability distribution of eigenstates observed in unbiased quantum measurements, but the reason it holds remains elusive. This manuscript discusses how the Born rule might be explained by Schrodinger equation dynamics, if a measurement comprises a system responding to random fluctuations until it is within an arbitrarily small tolerance of a measurement eigenstate. We describe the random walk dynamics that produce this behavior in terms of a class of time-dependent, stochastic unitary matrices U(t). We also discuss the class of stochastic potential energies in the Schrodinger equation that is equivalent to this class of unitary matrices.
  This analysis raises some questions worth considering, including how to determine if any measurements actually follow the predicted random walk mechanism and whether a reliable measurement apparatus could be designed that deviates from Born rule probabilities. Interestingly, if any measurements do follow this random walk mechanism, then exposing a quantum system to stochastic 'noise' is an intrinsic part of such a measurement, not merely an unwanted side effect. This characteristic would have implications for reducing noise in quantum sensing and quantum computing.
  This is a draft of a work in progress. Questions and suggestions are welcome.</description>

      <title>The trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To bypass using local observables as intermediate quantities in proving the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we have introduced an observable-independent measure of distinguishability. In this paper, we establish the connection between this measure and several other ETH measures in a more natural way. We first demonstrate a universal trade-off relation between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the measure. We then extend this discussion to eigenstate typicality and the average observable. This trade-off relationship reveals that the exponential growth of off-diagonal elements directly suppresses their own values, as well as indirectly suppressing the diagonal elements. This provides a new perspective on the physical mechanisms underlying ETH. Finally, through numerical calculations on a one-dimensional Ising spin chain, we explore various trade-off relationships and examine strong and weak ETH.</description>

      <title>Family of Quantum Mutual Information in Multiparty Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of information within a multiparty system is both significant and complex. This paper presents the concept of generalized conditional mutual information, along with a family of multiparty quantum mutual information measures. We provide interpretations and delineate the properties of these concepts, while also pointing out certain unresolved issues. The generalized conditional mutual information serves to encapsulate the interdependencies and correlations among various components of a multiparty quantum system. Additionally, various formulations of multiparty quantum mutual information contribute to a deeper comprehension of classical, quantum, and total correlations. These insights have the potential to propel fundamental research in the field of quantum information theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum XYZ product can construct a class of non-CSS codes by using three classical codes. However, before this work, their error-correcting performance is not studied in depth and whether this code construction method can be generalized to higher dimension is an open question. In this paper, we first study the error-correcting performance of the 3D Chamon code, which can be seen as a non-CSS variant of the 3D toric code and a special instance of the XYZ product of three repetition codes. Second, we show that XYZ product can be generalized to four dimension and propose four-dimensional (4D) XYZ product code construction, which can be seen as a variant of 4D homological product and constructs a class of non-CSS codes by using 4 classical codes or 2 CSS codes. Compared with 4D homological product, we show that 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with higher dimension or code distance. Third, we consider two special instances of 4D XYZ product, which we name 4D Chamon code and 4D XYZ concatenated code. Exploiting fully decoupled binary belief propagation combined with ordered statistics decoding, our simulation results show that, using the same two CSS codes, 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with better error-correcting performance for $Z$-biased noise than CSS codes constructed by 4D homological product, which is more meaningful for practice quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Principal Trotter Observation Error with Truncated Commutators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers, and the product formula is one of the most important methods for this purpose. Previous related work has mainly focused on the worst$-$case or average$-$case scenarios. In this work, we consider the simulation error under a fixed observable. Under a fixed observable, errors that commute with this observable become less important. To illustrate this point, we define the observation error as the expectation under the observable and provide a commutativity$-$based upper bound using the Baker$-$Campbell$-$Hausdorff formula. For highly commuting observables, the simulation error indicated by this upper bound can be significantly compressed. In the experiment with the Heisenberg model, the observation bound compresses the Trotter number by nearly half compared to recent commutator bounds. Additionally, we found that the evolution sequence significantly affects the observation error. By utilizing a simulated annealing algorithm, we designed a sequence optimization algorithm, achieving further compression of the Trotter number. The experiment on the hydrogen molecule Hamiltonian demonstrates that optimizing the sequence can lead to nearly half the reduction in the Trotter number.</description>

      <title>Towards Less Greedy Quantum Coalition Structure Generation in Induced Subgraph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to 100% renewable energy requires new techniques for managing energy networks, such as dividing them into sensible subsets of prosumers called micro-grids. Doing so in an optimal manner is a difficult optimization problem, as it can be abstracted to the Coalition Structure Generation problem in Induced Subgraph Games, a NP-complete problem which requires dividing an undirected, complete, weighted graph into subgraphs in a way that maximizes the sum of their internal weights. Recently, Venkatesh et al. (arXiv:2212.11372) published a Quantum Annealing (QA)-based iterative algorithm called GCS-Q, which they claim to be the best currently existing solver for the problem in terms of runtime complexity. As this algorithm makes the application of QA to the problem seem promising, but is a greedy one, this work proposes several less greedy QA-based approaches and investigates whether any of them can outperform GCS-Q in terms of solution quality. While we find that this is not the case yet on D-Wave hardware, most of them do when using the classical QBSolv software as a solver. Especially an algorithm we call 4-split iterative R-QUBO shows potential here, finding all optima in our dataset while scaling favorably with the problem size in terms of runtime. Thus, it appears to be interesting for future research on quantum approaches to the problem, assuming QA hardware will become more noise-resilient over time.</description>

Abstract: Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically-motivated protocol by which global quantum correlations, as characterised by the discord, can be distributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possess only classical correlations. In addition to this, said distribution is measurement-outcome independent, and the distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements. We also explore the scaling of this protocol for larger networks and illustrate the structure of the quantum correlations, showing its dependence on the local operations performed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 65.5% (observing only V ), which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system regarding practical usage. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interpretative problems of models of physical reality, including quantum information phenomenon in the context of Heisenberg's classification of the fundamental physical theoretic models under the role of universal constants Planck's constant $h$ and speed of light $c$. We introduce the correspondence principle between physical reality and mathematical models, and we discuss its significance in relation to physical models. We consider the status of quantum information in the standard quantum model, and based on the correspondence principle, we propose an interpretation of the wave function as a mathematical representation of quantum information. In this context, we consider Clauser's analysis of incompatibility formulations of quantum theory in laboratory space and configuration space in the context of local realism. Then, we introduce the hypothesis of quantum space of directly unobserved relations, which precede correlations in the ``classical'' Minkowski space-time and are compatible with the Reichenbach common cause principle. Finally, we present the Chyli\'nski model as an example of quantum relational space, which predicts potentially measurable effects for the bound states.</description>

      <title>Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have shown potential for quantum advantage with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for quantum machine learning (QML). However, given the high cost and limited availability of quantum resources, delegating VQAs via cloud networks is a more practical solution for clients with limited quantum capabilities. Recently, Shingu et al.[Physical Review A, 105, 022603 (2022)] proposed a variational secure cloud quantum computing protocol, utilizing ancilla-driven quantum computation (ADQC) for cloud-based VQAs with minimal quantum resource consumption. However, their protocol lacks verifiability, which exposes it to potential malicious behaviors by the server. Additionally, channel loss requires frequent re-delegation as the size of the delegated variational circuit grows, complicating verification due to increased circuit complexity. This paper introduces a new protocol to address these challenges and enhance both verifiability and tolerance to channel loss in cloud-based VQAs.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Small Graph Perturbations in the MaxCut Problem by QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem on different graph classes with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using symmetries. In particular, heuristics on the relationship between graph symmetries and the approximation ratio achieved by a QAOA simulation are considered. To do so, we first solve the MaxCut problem on well-known graphs, then we consider a simple and controllable perturbation of the graph and find again the approximate MaxCut with the QAOA. Through an analysis of the spectrum of the graphs and their perturbations, as well as a careful study of the associated automorphism groups, we aim to extract valuable insights into how symmetry impacts the performance of QAOA. These insights can then be leveraged to heuristically reduce the quantum circuit complexity, the number of training steps, or the number of parameters involved, thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of QAOA-based solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>

      <title>Study And Implementation of Unitary Gates in Quantum Computation Using Schrodinger Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis explores the concept of realizing quantum gates using physical systems like atoms and oscillators perturbed by electric and magnetic fields. The basic idea is that if a time-independent Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by a time-varying Hamiltonian of the form $f(t)V$, where $f(t)$ is a scalar function of time and $V$ is a Hermitian operator that does not commute with $H_0$, then a large class of unitary operators can be realized via the Schrodinger evolution corresponding to the time-varying Hamiltonian $H_0+f(t)V$. This is a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in Lie groups and Lie algebras. The thesis addresses two problems based on this idea: first, taking a Harmonic oscillator and perturbing it with a time-independent anharmonic term, and then computing $U_g=e^{-\iota T H_1}$. Then, perturbing the harmonic Hamiltonian with a linear time-dependent term, and calculating the unitary evolution corresponding to $H(t)$ at time $T$. This gate can be expressed as $U(T)=U(T,\epsilon,f)=T\{e^{-\iota\int_0^TH(t)dt}\}$.The anharmonic gate $U_g$ is replaced by a host of commonly used gates in quantum computation, such as controlled unitary gates and quantum Fourier transform gates. The control electric field is selected appropriately. The thesis also addresses the controllability issue, determining under what conditions there exists a scalar real valued function of time $f(t), 0\leq t\leq T$ such that if $|\psi_\iota\rangle$ is any initial wave function and $|\psi_f\rangle$ is any final wave function, then $U(T,f)|\psi_i\rangle=|\psi_f\rangle$. A partial solution was obtained by replacing the unitary evolution kernel by its Dyson series truncated version. In all design procedures, the gates that appear are infinite-dimensional, with an interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field modulated by a controllable function of time.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new approach for efficient and scalable simulations of measurement and control of quantum systems built upon existing phase-space methods, namely the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA). We benchmark against existing particle-filter methods by simulating measurement based feedback cooling in a two-mode system, whose low-dimensional nature permits a computation of an exact solution. The advantage of our method is multi-mode scalability, which we demonstrate through the first successful simulation of measurement-based feedback cooling of an incoherent quasi-1D thermal ensemble to quantum degeneracy. As the underlying principle of our approach exploits a general correspondence between measurement and coherent feedback, we anticipate it is also applicable across a broad range of other quantum control scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We consider a family of positive operator valued measures associated with representations of compact connected Lie groups. For many independent copies of a single state and a tensor power representation we show that the observed probability distributions converge to the value of the moment map. For invertible states we prove that the measures satisfy the large deviation principle with an explicitly given rate function.</description>

      <title>Full Eigenstate Thermalization via Free Cumulants in Quantum Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate-Thermalization-Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as the general framework to understand quantum statistical mechanics. Only recently has the attention been paid to so-called full ETH, which accounts for higher-order correlations among matrix elements, and that can be rationalized theoretically using the language of Free Probability. In this work, we perform the first numerical investigation of the full ETH in physical many-body systems with local interactions by testing the decomposition of higher-order correlators into thermal free cumulants for local operators. We perform exact diagonalization on two classes of local non-integrable (chaotic) quantum many-body systems: spin chain Hamiltonians and Floquet brickwork unitary circuits. We show that the dynamics of four-time correlation functions are encoded in fourth-order free cumulants, as predicted by ETH. Their dependence on frequency encodes the physical properties of local many-body systems and distinguishes them from structureless, rotationally invariant ensembles of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Landau levels and their analogs with higher Chern numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau levels are the eigenstates of a charged particle in two dimensions under a magnetic field, and are at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are two prototypical phenomena showing topological features. Following recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall phases in van der Waals materials, there is a rapid progress in understanding of the precise condition under which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized. It is now understood that the key to obtaining the fractional quantum Hall phases is the energy band whose eigenstates are holomorphic functions in both real and momentum space coordinates. Landau levels are indeed examples of such energy bands with an additional special property of having flat geometrical features. In this paper, we prove that, in fact, the only energy eigenstates having holomorphic wave functions with a flat geometry are the Landau levels and their higher Chern number analogs. Since it has been known that any holomorphic eigenstates can be constructed from the ones with a flat geometry such as the Landau levels, our uniqueness proof of the Landau levels allows one to construct any possible holomorphic eigenstate with which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency noise, Fano factor, $\Delta T$-noise and cross-correlations in double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical study on electrical current fluctuations in a double quantum dot connected to electronic reservoirs is presented, with the aim of deriving the finite-frequency noise, the Fano factor and the $\Delta T$-noise. We establish a general expression for the noise in terms of Green functions in the double quantum dot and self-energies in the reservoirs. This result is then applied to model double quantum dots in various situations. For a non-interacting double quantum dot, we have highlighted several interesting features in the physical properties of this system. In particular, we have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining a significant reduction in zero-frequency noise and Fano factor either when the system is placed in a given operating regime, or when a temperature gradient is applied between the two reservoirs, resulting in a negative $\Delta T$-noise being generated. In addition, in the vicinity of honeycomb vertices, a sign change is observed in the finite-frequency cross-correlator between the two reservoirs, in contrast to what is obtained for the zero-frequency cross-correlator, which remains negative throughout the $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-plane, $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ being the level energies in each of the two dots. By using an approximate first-level numerical approach, we finally study how the finite-frequency noise in a double quantum dot evolves under the influence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Spectral quantization of discrete random walks on half-line, and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define quantization scheme for discrete-time random walks on the half-line consistent with Szegedy's quantization of finite Markov chains. Motivated by the Karlin and McGregor description of discrete-time random walks in terms of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure with support in the segment $[-1,1]$, we represent the unitary evolution operator of the quantum walk in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. We find the relation between transition probabilities of the random walk with the Verblunsky coefficients of the corresponding polynomials of the quantum walk. We show that the both polynomials systems and their measures are connected by the classical Szeg\H{o} map. Our scheme can be applied to arbitrary Karlin and McGregor random walks and generalizes the so called Cantero-Gr\"{u}nbaum-Moral-Vel\'{a}zquez method. We illustrate our approach on example of random walks related to the Jacobi polynomials. Then we study quantization of random walks with constant transition probabilities where the corresponding polynomials on the unit circle have two-periodic real Verblunsky coefficients. We present geometric construction of the spectrum of such polynomials (in the general complex case) which generalizes the known construction for the Geronimus polynomials. In the Appendix we present the explicit form, in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle and polynomials orthogonal on the real line with coefficients of arbitrary period.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial Area Operators Require Non-local Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that no stabilizer codes over any local dimension can support a non-trivial area operator for any bipartition of the physical degrees of freedom even if certain code subalgebras contain non-trivial centers. This conclusion also extends to more general quantum codes whose logical operators satisfy certain factorization properties, including any complementary code that encodes qubits and supports transversal logical gates that form a nice unitary basis. These results support the observation that some desirable conditions for fault tolerance are in tension with emergent gravity and suggest that non-local "magic" would play an important role in reproducing features of gravitational back-reaction and the quantum extremal surface formula. We comment on conditions needed to circumvent the no-go result and examine some simple instances of non-stabilizer codes that do have non-trivial area operators.</description>

      <title>Accurate Computation of Quantum Excited States with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general, it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural networks as variational Ans\"atze for many-electron systems, and we show that by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ans\"atze we can accurately recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. Our method is the first deep learning approach to achieve accurate vertical excitation energies, including challenging double excitations, on benzene-scale molecules. Beyond the chemistry examples here, we expect this technique will be of great interest for applications to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01490v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced efficiency. Our ResumEE exponentially speeds up the computation of the exponentially small value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order R\'enyi EE, such that the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily computed with high accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on 2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE algorithm is efficient for precisely evaluating the entanglement entropy of SU($N$) spin models with continuous $N$ and reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effect in an ultracold Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. One example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas like curved space, high-order topological phases, and black holes, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here, we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin-orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with non-zero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Further, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the center of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points (EPs) are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated EPs emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.</description>

Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring diverse phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems with significant quantum effects. In this article, we propose an improved mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements, quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for the effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations, but can also detect the topological quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides an efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>ResQuNNs:Towards Enabling Deep Learning in Quantum Convolution Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09146v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers, significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced many-body quantum scars from the non-Hermitian Fock skin effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian pumping. Here we show that in kinetically-constrained many-body systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice with laser-induced loss. Additionally, we implement digital simulations of such scar enhancement on the IBM quantum processor. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in 2+1D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, which prevents thermalization from certain initial states after a long time, has been established across different quantum many-body systems. These include gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 quantum link models. Establishing quantum scars in gauge theories with high spin is not accessible with existing numerical methods, which rely on exact diagonalization. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ quantum link models. Our analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods and can guide quantum simulation experiments toward interesting non-equilibrium phenomena, inaccessible otherwise.</description>

Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Partial confinement in a quantum-link simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary particles, have recently garnered wide attention in quantum simulations based on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems subject to gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum mechanics meets quantum gravity phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we explore the experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: general experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum nanophotonics has forged a rich nexus of nanotechnology with photonic quantum information processing, offering remarkable prospects for advancing quantum technologies beyond their current technical limits in terms of physical compactness, energy efficiency, operation speed, temperature robustness and scalability. In this perspective, we highlight a number of recent studies that reveal the especially compelling potential of nanoplasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics for driving quantum technologies down to nanoscale spatial and ultrafast temporal regimes, whilst elevating them to ambient temperatures. Our perspective encompasses innovative proposals for quantum plasmonic biosensing, driving ultrafast single-photon emission and achieving near-field multipartite entanglement in the strong coupling regime, with a notable emphasis on the use of industry-grade devices. We conclude with an outlook emphasizing how the bespoke characteristics and functionalities of plasmonic devices are shaping contemporary research directives in ultrafast and room-temperature quantum nanotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Fragment quantum embedding using the Householder transformation: a multi-state extension based on ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent works by Yalouz et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 214112, 2022) and Sekaran et al. (Phys. Rev. B 104, 035121, 2021; Computation 10, 45, 2022), Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) has been reformulated through the use of the Householder transformation as a novel tool to embed a fragment within extended systems. The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would allow noise cancellation, directionality, increased sensitivity and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event-based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present a truly scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle control by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects simultaneously, the first demonstration of neuromorphic sensing for real-time control at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Low-depth, compact and error-tolerant photonic matrix-vector multiplication beyond the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale programmable photonic circuits are opening up new possibilities for information processing providing fast and energy-efficient means for matrix-vector multiplication. Here, we introduce a novel architecture of photonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices, usually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or quantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter meshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous designs, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology. We have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower depth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware errors.</description>

      <title>Additional dimensions of space and time in the domain of deep inelastic processes</title>

Abstract: We prove that the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty relations and Landau-Peierls uncertainty relations implicitly contain ``hidden'' angular variables, which belong to new uncertainty relations. Based on the obtained relations, we derive a formula for estimating the speed $U^*$ of a virtual particle in indirect measurements. We applied the theory of indirect measurements and the derived formula to estimate the module of the group velocity of virtual photons from the DIS HERA data. The HERA data indicate that the speed of virtual photons exceeds the speed of light $c$ in free space, $U^*&gt;c$. The properties of virtual photons and a hypothetical tachyon particle are almost identical. It is found that in the realm of particle interaction, the new angular parameters are closely related to the type of the phase-space geometry and dimensionality of the space-time continuum. It is suggested that the problem of the normalization condition $U^* =c$ at $Q^2=0\, \rm{GeV}^2$ can be solved naturally within the framework of ``Two-Time Physics'' developed by I. Bars. 2T-physics is the theory with local symplectic $\mathrm{Sp(2,R)}$ gauge symmetry in phase-space and the space-time geometry of signature $\mathrm{(1+1',d+1')}$ with one extra time-like and one extra space-like dimensions.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system using microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering to achieve local temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The system utilizes microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering, combined with fast cyclic detuning of the quantum dot on-site energies and Rabi oscillations, to efficiently transfer thermal populations to the ground state, thereby surpassing natural thermal transition rates. The cooling cycle involves adjusting gate potentials to drive the system through adiabatic and diabatic transitions, complemented by microwave pulses resonant with specific energy level differences. This mechanism continuously pumps the population from excited states into the ground state, effectively reducing the system's temperature. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these low local temperatures, with detailed analysis showing the sensitivity of cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time.</description>
