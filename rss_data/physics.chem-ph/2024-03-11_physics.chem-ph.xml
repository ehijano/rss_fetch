      <title>On the importance of experimental details: A Comment on "Non-Polaritonic Effects in Cavity-Modified Photochemistry"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an article by the Barnes group reported on the experimental study of a photoisomerization reaction inside an optical cavity, claiming to reproduce previous results by Hutchison et al. and making the point that in such setups, changes in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the molecules in the cavity can lead to modifications in the photochemical reaction rate. While Hutchison et al. associated such modifications with the emergence of strong light-matter coupling, in their attempt to re-examine these experiments, Barnes et al. did not find any evidence that strong coupling needs to be invoked to explain the observed effects. In response to this publication, we herein highlight the main differences between the two experimental studies, and explain why the results of Barnes et al. are irrelevant to the former study and have no bearing on its conclusions. Specifically, we show that under the experimental conditions used by Hutchison et al. such intensity-modification effects are negligible and can therefore be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of the Normal Intensity Distribution Law (NIDL) in the rovibrational emission spectrum of hydroxyl radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest experimental [Noll et al. Atmos. Chem. Phys. 20(2020)5269] and theoretical [Brooke et al. J. Quant. Spectr. Rad. Transfer 168(2016)142] data on the OH emission intensities are analyzed with use of the NIDL. It is found that the calculated intensities of the $\Delta v&gt;6$ transitions should not be trusted.
  The analysis of the OH data revealed that the NIDL theory is not applicable to the satellite bands. The effect of small reduced mass previously discovered in H$_2$ [Ushakov et al. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 399(2024)111863], causing the NIDL straight-line slope to be larger than the one associated with the repulsive branch of the potential, is demonstrated, and the same should be true of all the diatomic hydrides. We performed ab initio calculations of the OH repulsive branch and compared it with the one of Brooke et al. and the other due to Varandas and Voronin [Chem. Phys. 194(1995)91]. We found that the ab initio PEF closely follows the Varandas-Voronin potential in the repulsive region important for calculating the overtone intensities [Medvedev, J. Chem. Phys. 137(2012)174307]. Assumption is made that different potentials can be used to calculate transition frequencies and intensities for spectroscopic databases.</description>

      <title>Aqueous Solution Chemistry In Silico and the Role of Data Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of computer simulations to study the properties of aqueous systems is, today more than ever, an active area of research. In this context, during the last decade there has been a tremendous growth in the use of data-driven approaches to develop more accurate potentials for water as well as to characterize its complexity in chemical and biological contexts. We highlight the progress, giving a historical context, on the path to the development of many-body and reactive potentials to model aqueous chemistry, including the role of machine learning strategies. We focus specifically on conceptual and methodological challenges along the way in performing simulations that seek to tackle problems in modeling the chemistry of aqueous solutions. In conclusion, we summarize our perspectives on the use and integration of advanced data-science techniques to provide chemical insights in physical chemistry and how this will influence computer simulations of aqueous systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spin contamination in algebraic diagrammatic construction theory of electronic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) is a computationally efficient approach for simulating excited electronic states, absorption spectra, and electron correlation. Due to their origin in perturbation theory, the single-reference ADC methods may be susceptible to spin contamination when applied to molecules with unpaired electrons. In this work, we develop an approach to quantify spin contamination in the ADC calculations of electronic excitations and apply it to a variety of open-shell molecules starting with either the unrestricted (UHF) or restricted open-shell (ROHF) Hartree-Fock reference wavefunctions. Our results show that the accuracy of low-order ADC approximations (ADC(2), ADC(3)) significantly decreases when the UHF reference spin contamination exceeds 0.05 a.u. Such strongly spin-contaminated molecules exhibit severe excited-state spin symmetry breaking that contributes to decreasing the quality of computed excitation energies and oscillator strengths. In a case study of phenyl radical, we demonstrate that spin contamination can significantly affect the simulated UV/Vis spectra, altering the relative energies, intensities, and order of electronic transitions. The results presented here motivate the development of spin-adapted ADC methods for open-shell molecules.</description>

      <title>MP2-based composite extrapolation schemes can predict core-ionization energies for first-row elements with coupled-cluster level accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) to reveal element-specific insights into chemical environment and bonding. Accurate theoretical CEBE prediction aids XPS interpretation but requires proper modeling of orbital relaxation and electron correlation upon core-ionization. This work systematically investigates basis set selection for extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit of CEBEs from $\Delta$MP2 and $\Delta$CC energies across 94 K-edges in diverse organic molecules. We demonstrate that an alternative composite scheme using $\Delta$MP2 in a large basis corrected by $\Delta$CC-$\Delta$MP2 difference in a small basis can quantitatively recover optimally extrapolated $\Delta$CC CEBEs within 0.02 eV. Unlike $\Delta$CC, MP2 calculations do not suffer from convergence issues and are computationally cheaper, and, thus, the composite $\Delta$MP2/$\Delta$CC scheme balances accuracy and cost, overcoming limitations of solely using either method. We conclude by providing a comprehensive analysis of the choice of small and large basis sets for the composite schemes and provide practical recommendations for highly accurate (within 0.10-0.15 eV MAE) ab initio prediction of XPS spectra.</description>

      <title>Chemical Potentials and the One-Electron Hamiltonian of the Second-Order Perturbation Theory from the Functional Derivative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functional derivative approach to calculate the chemical potentials of the second-order perturbation theory (MP2). In the functional derivative approach, the correlation part of the MP2 chemical potential, which is the derivative of the MP2 correlation energy with respect to the occupation number of frontier orbitals, is obtained from the chain rule via the non-interacting Green's function. First, the MP2 correlation energy is expressed in terms of the non-interacting Green's function and its functional derivative to the non-interacting Green's function is the second-order self-energy. Then the derivative of the non-interacting Green's function to the occupation number is obtained by including the orbital relaxation effect. We show that the MP2 chemical potentials obtained from the functional derivative approach agrees with that obtained from the finite difference approach. The one-electron Hamiltonian, defined as the derivative of the MP2 energy with respect to the one particle density matrix, is also derived using the functional derivative approach, which can be used in the self-consistent calculations of MP2 and double-hybrid density functionals. The developed functional derivative approach is promising for calculating the chemical potentials and the one-electron Hamiltonian of approximate functionals and many-body perturbation approaches dependent explicitly on the non-interacting Green's function.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Interpretable Representation of Correlated Electronic Structure via Tensor Product Selected CI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of computing wavefunctions that are accurate, yet simple enough mathematical objects to use for reasoning has long been a challenge in quantum chemistry. The difficulty in drawing physical conclusions from a wavefunction is often related to the generally large number of configurations with similar weights. In Tensor Product Selected CI, we use a locally correlated tensor product state basis, which has the effect of concentrating the weight of a state onto a smaller number of physically interpretable degrees of freedom. In this paper, we apply TPSCI to a series of three molecular systems ranging in separability, one of which is the first application of TPSCI to an open-shell bimetallic system. For each of these systems, we obtain accurate solutions to large active spaces, and analyze the resulting wavefunctions through a series of different approaches including (i) direct inspection of the TPS basis coefficients, (ii) construction of Bloch effective Hamiltonians, and (iii) computation of cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy, highly-polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HBr, using two consecutive shaped UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the ion-acceleration lasers. The density of SPH can surpass $\approx$10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, allowing the production of GeV electrons with polarization larger than 90%.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics simulation of the abrupt changes in the thermodynamic properties of water after formation of nano-bubbles / nano-cavities induced by passage of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale formalism that accounts for the formation of nano-scale bubbles/cavities owing to a burst of water molecules after the passage of high energy charged particles that leads to the formation of hot non-ionizing excitations or thermal spikes (TS). We demonstrate the coexistence of a rapidly growing condensed state of water and a hot spot that forms a stable state of diluted water at high temperatures and pressures, possibly at a supercritical phase. Depending on the temperature of TS, the thin shell of a highly dense state of water grows by three to five times the speed of sound in water, forming a thin layer of shock wave (SW) buffer, wrapping around the nano-scale cylindrical symmetric cavity. The stability of the cavity, as a result of the incompressibility of water at ambient conditions and the surface tension, allows the transition of supersonic SW to a subsonic contact discontinuity and dissipation to thermo-acoustic sound waves. We further study the mergers of nanobubbles that lead to fountain-like or jet-flow structures at the collision interface. We introduce a time delay in the nucleation of nano-bubbles, a novel mechanism, responsible for the growth and stability of much larger or even micro-bubbles, possibly relevant to FLASH ultra-high dose rate (UHDR). The current study is potentially significant at FLASH-UHDRs. Our analysis predicts the black-body radiation from the transient supercritical state of water localized in nano-cavities wrapping around the track of charged particles can be manifested in the (indirect) water luminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Defects Genome of 2D Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from their unique two-faced structure, broken-mirror symmetry, and consequent colossal polarisation field within the monolayer. While efforts have been made to achieve high-quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain-boundary and point defects with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic properties Through High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point defects are single (Vs and Vse) and double chalcogen vacancy (Vs-Vse), interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic studies on h-BN-encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality and device properties.</description>

      <title>On the Echogenicity of Natural Starch-Based Blood Mimicking Fluids for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging: Preliminary In-vitro Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural starch-based blood-mimicking fluid (BMF) has been used as an alternative to commercially available BMFs for in-vitro Doppler investigations in low-resource settings. Most reported works in the literature have used corn starch-based BMF. Evaluation of other natural starches for potential BMF and their characterization have relatively been unexplored in the literature. To this end, this work investigates the echogenicity of corn-, potato-, tapioca-, and wheat starch-based BMFs prepared using a liquid base of pure water-glycerol mixture with three different starch concentrations (1%, 3%, and 5%). The experiments were performed by manually pumping the BMFs to a PolyVinyl alcohol (PVA) based flow phantom using a syringe and raw datasets were acquired using a Verasonics Vantage 128 Research Ultrasound System. Echogenicity was measured as the mean pixel intensity in a selected region of interest (ROI) in the beamformed image. Among the four natural starch-based BMFs, potato starch-based BMF showed the highest echogenicity and contrast with almost 13%, 14%, and 10% higher pixel intensities (dB) than that of the least echoic BMF with 1%, 3%, and 5% starch concentrations respectively. Moreover, the echogenicity of corn, tapioca, and wheat starch-based BMF was observed to be similar, and the results suggest that these BMFs with higher starch concentrations shall be employed for in-vitro contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio QED calculations of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant in helium-like ions are presented. We combine the nonrelativistic QED approach based on an expansion in powers of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the so-called ``all-order'' QED approach which includes all orders in the parameter $Z\alpha$ but uses a perturbation expansion in the parameter $1/Z$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number). The combination of the two complementary methods makes our treatment applicable both to low-$Z$ and high-$Z$ ions. Our calculations confirm the presence of a rare antiscreening effect for the relativistic shielding correction and demonstrate the importance of the inclusion of the negative-energy part of the Dirac spectrum.</description>

      <title>Rapid state-recrossing kinetics in non-Markovian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) is one standard measure for the reaction time in thermally activated barrier-crossing processes. While the relationship between MFPTs and phenomenological rate coefficients is known for systems that satisfy Markovian dynamics, it is not clear how to interpret MFPTs for experimental and simulation time-series data generated by non-Markovian systems. Here, we simulate a one-dimensional generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in a bistable potential and compare two related numerical methods for evaluating MFPTs: one that only incorporates information about first arrivals between subsequent states and is equivalent to calculating the waiting time, or dwell time, and one that incorporates information about all first-passages associated with a given barrier-crossing event and is therefore typically employed to enhance numerical sampling. In the Markovian limit, the two methods are equivalent. However, for significant memory times, the two methods suggest dramatically different reaction kinetics. By focusing on first-passage distributions, we systematically reveal the influence of memory-induced rapid state-recrossing on the MFPTs, which we compare to various other numerical or theoretical descriptions of reaction times. Overall, we demonstrate that it is necessary to consider full first-passage distributions, rather than just the mean barrier-crossing kinetics when analyzing non-Markovian time series data.</description>

      <title>Evidence of sharp transitions between octahedral and capped trigonal prism states of the solvation shell of Fe$^{+3}$(aq)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of the solvation shell of aqueous Fe$^{+3}$ ion has been a subject of controversy due to discrepancies between experiments and different levels of theory. We address this issue by performing simulations for a wide range of ion concentrations, using various empirical potential energy functions, as well as density functional theory calculations of selected configurations. The solvation shell undergoes abrupt transitions between two states: an octahedral (OH) state with 6-fold coordination, and a capped trigonal prism (CTP) state with 7-fold coordination. The lifetime of these states is concentration dependent. In dilute $\mathrm{FeCl_3}$ solutions, the lifetime of the two states is similar ($\approx 1$ ns). However, the lifetime of the OH state increases with ion concentration, while that of the CTP state decreases slightly. When a uniform negative background charge is used instead of explicit counterions, the lifetime of the OH state is greatly overestimated. These findings underscore the need for further experimental measurements as well as high-level simulations over sufficiently long timescales and low concentration.</description>

      <title>Methane dimer rovibrational states and Raman transition moments</title>

Abstract: Benchmark-quality rovibrational data are reported for the methane dimer from variational nuclear motion computations using an ab initio intermolecular potential energy surface reported by [M. P. Metz et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, 21, 13504-13525]. A simple polarizability model is used to compute Raman transition moments that may be relevant for future direct observation of the intermolecular dynamics. Non-negligible $\Delta K\neq 0$ transition moments arise in this symmetric top system due to strong rovibrational couplings.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Nuclear Dynamics in Double-Core Ionized Water Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-core-hole (DCH) states in isolated water and heavy water molecules, resulting from the sequential absorption of two x-ray photons, have been investigated. A comparison of the subsequent Auger emission spectra from the two isotopes provides direct evidence of ultrafast nuclear motion during the 1.5 fs lifetime of these DCH states. Our numerical results align well with the experimental data, providing for various DCH states an in-depth study of the dynamics responsible of the observed isotope effect.</description>

      <title>Activating the fluorescence of a Ni(II) complex by energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luminescence of open-shell 3d metal complexes is often quenched due to ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) and cooling into a dark metal-centered excited state. We demonstrate successful activation of fluorescence from individual nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by resonant energy transfer from other metal phthalocyanines at low temperature. By combining STM, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, STM- induced luminescence, and photoluminescence experiments as well as time-dependent density functional theory, we provide evidence that there is an activation barrier for the ISC, which in most experimental conditions is overcome. We show that this is also the case in an electroluminescent tunnel junction where individual NiPc molecules adsorbed on an ultrathin NaCl decoupling film on a Ag(111) substrate are probed. However, when placing an MPc (M = Zn, Pd, Pt) molecule close to NiPc by means of STM atomic manipulation, resonant energy transfer can excite NiPc without overcoming the ISC activation barrier, leading to Q-band fluorescence. This work demonstrates that the thermally activated population of dark metal-centered states can be avoided by a designed local environment at low temperatures paired with a directed molecular excitation into vibrationally cold electronic states. Thus, we can envisage the use of luminophores based on more abundant transition metal complexes that do not rely on Pt or Ir.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Barrier of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory for Molecular Systems Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) is a quantum chemistry formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham DFT, which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. Here we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular systems using a deep learning functional model. We build the essential non-locality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much larger than those seen in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling of OFDFT for studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier in quantum chemistry.</description>
