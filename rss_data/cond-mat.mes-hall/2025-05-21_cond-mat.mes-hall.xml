      <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Procedure of tuning up a three-site artificial Kitaev chain based on transmon measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains (AKCs), formed of quantum dot-superconductor linear arrays, provide a promising platform for hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) and implementing topological quantum computing. The main challenges along this research direction would include the tuning up of AKCs for hosting MBSs and the readout of the parity of the chains. In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given. We find that the sweet spots in a three-site AKC can be classified into three types based on the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR): ECT-dominated sweet spots, genuine sweet spots and CAR-dominated sweet spots. We show that the ECT-dominated and CAR-dominated sweet spots can be more conveniently accessed and utilized in transmon-based measurements.</description>

      <title>All-electrical near-field injection of excitons in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals materials have become a promising building block for future electronics and photonics. The two-dimensional magnet CrSBr came into the spotlight of solid state research due to its intriguing combination of antiferromagnetic order, strong light-matter coupling and unusual quasi-1D electronic bandstructure. This study reports the electrical excitation of excitons in CrSBr layers from cryogenic temperatures up to room temperature. By exploiting the energy transfer via tunneling electrons in a graphene tunnel junction strongly bound excitons are excited in proximate CrSBr layers. This facilitates electrically-excited emission from CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nm, in which the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirms the excitonic origin. For thicker layers, clear evidence for the electrically excited emission from self-hybridized exciton polaritons is observed, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr. These results pave the way for future applications in spintronic and optical readout of magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among molecular spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S = 1/2) delocalized over the phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on a metal Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy. On that surface, YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the (111) crystal axes. We observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing the molecular patches on Cu(111). For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a widely separated highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when the YPc$_2$ is separated from the substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic ZnPc layer, we find the HOMO to split into singly occupied (SOMO) and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SUMO). We find that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in the YPc$_2$. Density functional theory reveals the spin quenching to be due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validates the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes in a Heterogenous Structure of Topological and Trivial Domains in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the existence of vortices in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with and without Majoarana zero modes (MZMs) can be explained by a heterogeneous mixture of strong topological and trivial superconducting domains, with only vortices in the former exhibiting MZMs. We identify the spectroscopic signatures of topological and trivial vortices and show that they are necessarily separated by a domain wall harboring Majorana edge modes. We demonstrate that when a vortex is moved from a trivial to a topological domain in real time, a domain wall Majorana edge mode is transferred to the vortex as an MZM.</description>

      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Perpendicularly magnetized Tb/Co multilayers featuring tilted uniaxial anisotropy: Experiments and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann and scalar Wilczek-Zee phases of degenerate quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exactly solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to the underlying topology. Some conditions are derived in an analytic analysis, under which the Uhlmann phase in the zero-temperature limit converges to the scalar WZ phase. We also briefly discuss possible realizations or simulations of the phenomena as well as their implications.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-mediated quantum entanglement via bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum technologies demand entanglement between many distant quantum emitters (QEs), for which we propose using high-$Q$, spatially extended bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We show that QE-BIC coupling efficiencies ($\beta$-factors) can exceed $80\%$, comparable to waveguides even without further mode engineering, but within a 2D geometry that naturally accommodates large QE arrays and relaxes strict emitter placement. Inter-QE entanglement is generated faster than in free space, is significantly amplified, and persists over several resonant wavelengths. Optimality requires large $\beta$-factors but moderately small Purcell factors. Our results establish all-dielectric metasurfaces as a practical, scalable platform for leading-edge quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Fractional-statistics-induced entanglement from Andreev-like tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of anyonic statistics stands as a cornerstone in the landscape of topological quantum techniques. While recent years have brought forth encouraging and persuasive strides in detecting anyons, a significant facet remains unexplored, especially in view of connecting anyonic physics to quantum information platforms -- whether and how entanglement can be generated by anyonic braiding. Here, we demonstrate that even when two anyonic subsystems (represented by anyonic beams) are connected only by electron tunneling, entanglement between them, manifesting fractional statistics, is generated. To demonstrate this physics, we rely on a platform where fractional quantum Hall edges are bridged by a quantum point contact that allows only transmission of fermions (so-called Andreev-like tunneling). This invokes the physics of two-beam collisions in an anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel collider, accompanied by a process that we dub anyon-quasihole braiding. We define an entanglement pointer -- a current-noise-based function tailored to quantify entanglement associated with quasiparticle fractional statistics. Our work, which exposes, both in theory and in experiment, entanglement associated with anyonic statistics and braiding, prospectively paves the way to the exploration of entanglement induced by non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Knots and the classification of non-Hermitian lattices under $C_n$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two dimensions, Hermitian lattices with non-zero Chern numbers and non-Hermitian lattices with a higher-order skin effect (HOSE) bypass the constraints of the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem at their one-dimensional boundaries. This allows the realization of topologically-protected one-dimensional edges with nonreciprocal dynamics. However, unlike the edge states of Chern insulators, the nonreciprocal edges of HOSE phases exist only at certain edges of the two-dimensional lattice, not all, leading to corner-localized states. In this paper, we investigate the topological connections between these two systems and uncover novel non-Hermitian topological phases possessing higher-order topological knots (HOTKs). These phases arise from multiband topology protected by crystalline symmetries and host nonreciprocal edge states that circulate the entire boundary of the two-dimensional lattice. We show that phase transitions typically separate HOTK phases from complex Chern insulator phases - non-Hermitian lattices with nonzero Chern numbers protected by imaginary line gaps in the presence of time-reversal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Optimizing proximitized magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons for Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterostructures comprised of a magnetic topological insulator (MTI) placed in the proximity of an $s$-wave superconductor have emerged as a platform for the practical realization of Majorana bound states (MBSs). More specifically, it has been theoretically predicted that MBS can appear in proximitized MTI nanoribbons (PNRs) in the quantum anomalous Hall regime. As with all MBS platforms, disorder and device imperfections can be detrimental to the formation of robust and well-separated MBSs that are suitable for fusion and braiding experiments. Here, we identify the optimal conditions for obtaining a topological superconducting gap that is robust against disorder, with spatially separated stable MBSs in PNRs, and introduce a figure of merit that encompasses these conditions. Particular attention is given to the thin-film limit of magnetic topological insulators (MTIs), where the hybridization of the surface states cannot be neglected, and to the role of electron-hole asymmetry in the low-energy physics of the system. Based on our numerical results, we find that (1) MTI thin films that are normal (rather than quantum spin Hall) insulators for zero magnetization are favorable, (2) strong electron-hole asymmetry causes the stability and robustness of MBS to be very different for chemical potentials above or below the Dirac point, and (3) the magnetization strength should preferably be comparable to the hybridization or confinement energy of the surface states, whichever is largest.</description>

      <title>Generalized Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a unified theory termed the generalized non-Hermitian skin effect. This framework provides a universal characterization of typical one-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effects within the perturbative regime and unveils a novel type of skin effect that beyond the predictions of the generalized Brillouin zone theory, referred to as the relative skin effect. Previously recognized skin effects are classified as global skin effects, thereby explicitly delineating the scope and limitations of existing non-Bloch band theories. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, a phase transition criterion between global skin effects and relative skin effect, demonstrating the competition between these two distinct types of skin effects, emphasizing the pivotal role of real-space non-Hermitian terms in understanding skin effects and challenging the traditional reliance of non-Bloch band theory on momentum space. Our study substantially advances the conceptual framework of non-Hermitian physics and provides new theoretical tools for investigation.</description>

      <title>Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in open quantum system simulation with Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches for performing numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment and non-perturbative context, these methods require an optimized choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans\"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. Here, we show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable the joint {System + Environments} state to be written as a matrix product state, considerably reduce the bond dimension required for convergence despite introducing long-ranged interactions. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses for tweaking tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in many important models of physical open systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the microscopic to macroscopic crossover using superconducting quantum impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Tunable anharmonicity in cavity optomechanics in the unresolved sideband regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</description>
