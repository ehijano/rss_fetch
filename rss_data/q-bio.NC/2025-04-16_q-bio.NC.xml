      <title>Emergence of Creativity and Individuality in Music: Insights from Brain's Statistical Learning and its Embodied Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music is a universal feature of human culture, linked to embodied cognitive functions that drive learning, action, and the emergence of creativity and individuality. Evidence highlights the critical role of statistical learning an implicit cognitive process of the brain in musical creativity and individuality. Despite its significance, the precise neural and computational mechanisms underpinning these dynamic and embodied cognitive processes re-main poorly understood. This paper discusses how individuality and creativity emerge within the framework of the brain's statistical learning, drawing on a series of neural and computational studies. This work offers perspectives on the mechanisms driving the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning abilities and embodied mechanisms and provides a framework to explain the paradoxical phenomenon where individuals with specific cognitive traits that limit certain perceptual abilities excel in creative domains.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment in Elderly using a Passive FPVS-EEG BCI and Machine Learning -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dementia diagnosis requires biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional brain changes. While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have progressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive decline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely on behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort, practice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and accurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment levels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method employs a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating the need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the participant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working memory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active cognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased detection of cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>
