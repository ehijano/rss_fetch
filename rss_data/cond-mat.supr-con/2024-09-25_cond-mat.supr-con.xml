      <title>Enhanced Coupling of Superconductivity and Evolution of Gap Structure in CsV3Sb5 through Ta Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed investigation of kagome superconductors CsV3Sb5 single crystal and its Ta-doped variant, Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, through specific heat measurements. Our results show a clear suppression of the charge density wave (CDW) and notable increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) from 2.8 K to 4.6 K upon Ta doping. The electronic specific heat of the pristine CsV3Sb5 sample can be fitted with a model comprising an s-wave gap and a highly anisotropic extended s-wave gap, where the ratio 2{\Delta}/k_B T_c is smaller than the weak coupling limit of 3.5. For the doped sample Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, it exhibits two isotropic s-wave gaps, yielding the larger gap of 2{\Delta}/k_B T_c=5.04, which indicates a significant enhancement in superconducting coupling. This evolution is attributed to the increased density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level released through the suppression of the CDW gap. Our results demonstrate enhanced superconducting coupling and variation of gap structure in CsV3Sb5 due to Ta doping.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of pseudogap and pairing energy in a cuprate high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudogap stands out in the phase diagram of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors because its origin and relationship to superconductivity remain elusive. The origin of the pseudogap has been debated, with competing hypotheses attributing it to preformed electron pairs or local order, such as charge density waves. Here, we present unambiguous evidence supporting the pairing scenario, using local shot-noise spectroscopy measurements in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}. Our data demonstrates that the pseudogap energy coincides with the onset of electron pairing, and is spatially heterogeneous with values reaching up to 70 meV. Our results exclude a pure local order origin of the pseudogap, link the pseudogap to Cooper pair formation, and show that the limiting factor for higher Tc in cuprates is phase coherence.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in a model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave orders in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is evidence for competition between superconductivity and short-range charge-density wave order in a number of cuprate compounds and especially in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Here, we employ a non-linear sigma model of such competition to study the effects of correlated disorder within the chain layers and Gaussian disorder within the CuO$_2$ layers. The first is relevant to the oxygen ortho structure and the latter may be induced by electron irradiation. We find that reducing the correlation length of the potential on the chain layers decreases the size of the charge-density wave structure factor but has little effect on its temperature dependence, as observed experimentally. At the same time, the charge-density wave correlation length decreases more than is seen in the experiment. The temperature at which the structure factor peaks coincides with $T_c$ and both decrease when disorder is introduced into the CuO$_2$ planes. Strengthening this disorder reduces the magnitude of the structure factor and eventually turns it into a monotonic function of the temperature. This occurs despite the fact that the local magnitude of the charge-density correlations increases.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 1e13 V/W</description>

      <title>A recipe for an effective selection of promising candidates for high-temperature superconductors among binary hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on compressed binary hydrides have unveiled the potential for achieving superconductivity at near-room-temperature. Nevertheless, the available decision-making procedures standing behind the selection of constituent elements that may potentially exhibit high values of critical temperature ($T_c$) are far from optimal. In other words, a lot of experimental and numerical effort is wasted on exploring unpromising compounds. By conducting a deep study of a database containing over $580$ binary hydride superconductors, we were able to observe some interesting relationships between $T_c$ and selected physico-chemical properties of examined compounds. Among studied parameters, the ratio of the sum of the molecular weight of heavier atoms to the total mass of all hydrogen atoms in the chemical formula of hydride ($M_X/M_H$) was found to be the most valuable indicator that can help to screen for new promising superconductor candidates. This is because the highest $T_c$ requires the lowest $M_X/M_H$ ratio. Statistical analysis indicates a $28\%$ chance of finding $T_c &gt; 200$ K within $0 &lt; M_X/M_H &lt; 15$. It is expected that these findings will not only allow for more efficient use of resources by improving future superconductor candidates selection but also they will accelerate ongoing experimental and numerical research that should bring new exciting discoveries in a much shorter time.</description>

      <title>Kohn-Luttinger Mechanism of Superconductivity in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$: Gate-Tunable Unconventional Pairing Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we theoretically investigate the pairing instability induced by Coulomb interaction via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. Within random phase approximation, we show that the Coulomb repulsion is strongly screened around the mori\'e length scale, resulting in attractive regimes that facilitate electron pairing in unconventional channels. By solving the linearized gap equation, we find that the maxima of the superconducting critical temperature occur at the van Hove singularities in the density of states, with magnitude on the order of $\sim$0.2 K, comparable with experimental observations. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from an $f$-wave-like pairing state to a doubly degenerate $d$-wave-like pairing state upon increasing the electric displacement field. These findings provide a purely electronic explanation of the superconducting state observed in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, offering insights into the interplay between superconductivity and other correlated states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Quantum-interference-induced pairing in antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t$-$J$ model is investigated via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamical mean field study of intra-unit-cell charge nematicity in hole-doped cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scanning-tunneling microscopy on hole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$, one of the materials of the cuprate family, finds a long-range ordered spontaneous splitting of the energy levels of oxygen orbitals inside the CuO$_2$ unit cells [S. Wang et al., Nat. Mat. 23, 492-498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks $C_4$ symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by $V_{pp}$) between oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard (aka the Emery-VSA model), using cluster dynamical mean field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between $V_{pp}$ and $V_{pd}$ (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and oxygen $p_{x,y}$ electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.</description>

      <title>Effect of Etching Methods on Dielectric Losses in Transmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are considered as a promising platform for implementing a fault tolerant quantum computing. However, surface defects of superconductors and the substrate leading to qubit state decoherence and fluctuations in qubit parameters constitute a significant problem. The amount and type of defects depend both on the chip materials and fabrication procedure. In this work, transmons produced by two different methods of aluminum etching: wet etching in a solution of weak acids and dry etching using a chlorine-based plasma are experimentally studied. The relaxation and coherence times for dry-etched qubits are more than twice as long as those for wet-etched ones. Additionally, the analysis of time fluctuations of qubit frequencies and relaxation times, which is an effective method to identify the dominant dielectric loss mechanisms, indicates a significantly lower impact of two-level systems in the dry-etched qubits compared to the wet-etched ones.</description>

      <title>Exposing the odd-parity superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ with hydrostatic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd-parity superconductivity is a fundamentally interesting but rare state of matter with a potential for applications in topological quantum computing. Crystals with staggered locally noncentrosymmetric structures have been proposed as platforms where a magnetic field can induce a transition between even- and odd-parity superconducting (SC) states. The strongly correlated superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ with the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ is likely the first example material showing such a phase transition, which occurs at the magnetic field $\mu_{0}H^{*}=4\,\mathrm{T}$ applied along the crystallographic $c$ axis. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ also undergoes a phase transition of an unknown origin at $T_{0}=0.5\,\mathrm{K}$. By subjecting CeRh$_2$As$_2$ to hydrostatic pressure and mapping the resultant changes to the SC phase diagrams we investigated how the lattice compression and changes to the electronic correlations affect the stability and relative balance of the two SC states. The abnormally high in-plane upper critical field becomes even higher close to a quantum critical point of the $T_{0}$ order. Remarkably, the SC phase-switching field $H^{*}$ is drastically reduced under pressure, dropping to $0.3\,\mathrm{T}$ at $2.7\,\mathrm{GPa}$. This result signals an apparent strengthening of the local noncentrosymmetricity and forecasts a possible stabilization of the putative odd-parity state down to zero field, hitherto not considered by theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole polarization supporting short-range pairing in cuprate high-temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. These polarization effects suppress short-range Coulomb repulsion in the antinodal directions as necessary for pairing, strongly reducing the need for retardation effects and explaining the short coherence lengths and the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nearly degenerate ground states of a checkerboard antiferromagnet and their bosonic interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ model system with antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings on a $J_1$-$J_2$ checkerboard lattice, known as the planar pyrochlore model, is strongly frustrated and associated with a two-to-one dimensional crossover. Using the Projected Entangled Simplex States tensor network ansatz, we identify a large number of nearly degenerate states in the frustrated region ($J_1&lt;J_2$). Specifically, we find the long-sought crossed-dimer valence bond solid (VBS) state to be the ground state at $J_1\lesssim J_2$, while various 1D AF correlated states take over the rest. We verify the stability of the VBS state against nematic perturbation. The corresponding bosonic picture provides an intuitive understanding of the low-energy physics. Particularly, it predicts weaker VBS states in the easy-plane limit, which we confirm numerically. Our results clarify the most essential ground state properties of this interesting system and demonstrate the usefulness of bosonic picture in dealing with frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Two-band atomic superfluidity in the presence of an orbital Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static superfluid properties of alkali-earth-like Fermi atomic systems in the presence of orbital Feshbach resonance. Using a two-band description of the ground state and excited state and a mean-field approximation of the intra-band atomic pairing, we investigate the phase transitions and crossover between BCS and Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) superfluidity. At zero temperature, we find exact BCS analytical solutions for the mean-field gap equations and number equations. Using these exact solutions, we calculate various static properties, such as superfluid order parameters, chemical potentials, density variations, density profiles, correlation and coherence lengths, ground-state energy, and Tan's contact density across the entire BCS-BEC crossover region. We anticipate that our closed-form analytical results can be used as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical investigations and will have an impact on the current understanding of two-band superconductors such as MgB$_2$.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned quantum criticality in the locally non-centrosymmetric superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unconventional superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ (critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx0.4\,\mathrm{K}$) displays an exceptionally rare magnetic-field-induced transition between two distinct superconducting (SC) phases, proposed to be states of even and odd parity of the SC order parameter, which are enabled by a locally noncentrosymmetric structure. The superconductivity is preceded by a phase transition of unknown origin at $T_{0}\approx0.5\,\mathrm{K}$. Electronic low-temperature properties of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ show pronounced non-Fermi-liquid behavior, indicative of a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP). The role of quantum fluctuations and normal state orders for the superconductivity in a system with staggered Rashba interaction is currently an open question, pertinent to explaining the occurrence of two-phase superconductivity. In this work, using measurements of resistivity and specific heat under hydrostatic pressure, we show that the $T_{0}$ order vanishes completely at a modest pressure of $P_{0}=0.5\,\mathrm{GPa}$, revealing a QCP. In line with the quantum criticality picture, the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity at $P_{0}$ evolves into a Fermi-liquid quadratic dependence as quantum critical fluctuations are suppressed by increasing pressure. Furthermore, the domelike behavior of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ around $P_{0}$ implies that the fluctuations of the $T_{0}$ order are involved in the SC pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>A compact inertial nano-positioner operating at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of a compact inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics operating down to 2 K, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We also present the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform PCAR measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures. The small footprint of our nano-positioner makes it ideally suited for incorporation in low temperature scanning probe microscopes and makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>
