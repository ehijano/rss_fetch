      <title>Riemannian conjugate Sobolev gradients and their application to compute ground states of BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the numerical computation of ground states of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) which can exhibit a multiscale lattice of quantized vortices. This problem involves the minimization of an energy functional on a Riemannian manifold. For this we apply the framework of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of Sobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous work that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients methods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy. In this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special attention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search direction and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As known from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum parameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor. Besides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the methods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a standard $H^1_0$-metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the numerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed adaptive metric along with a Polak-Ribi\'ere or Hestenes-Stiefel-type momentum parameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the other CG methods that were part of our numerical study.</description>

      <title>A Mixed finite element method for the velocity-pseudostress formulation of the Oseen eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a mixed formulation for the Oseen eigenvalue problem by introducing the pseudostress tensor as a new unknown, allowing us to eliminate the fluid pressure. The well-posedness of the solution operator is established using a fixed-point argument. For the numerical analysis, we use the tensorial versions of Raviart-Thomas and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements to approximate the pseudostress, and piecewise polynomials for the velocity. Convergence and a priori error estimates are derived based on compact operator theory. We present a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Uniformly $hp$-stable elements for the elasticity complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the discretization of symmetric, divergence-conforming stress tensors in continuum mechanics, we prove inf-sup stability bounds which are uniform in polynomial degree and mesh size for the Hu--Zhang finite element in two dimensions. This is achieved via an explicit construction of a bounded right inverse of the divergence operator, with the crucial component being the construction of bounded Poincar\'e operators for the stress elasticity complex which are polynomial-preserving, in the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand framework of the finite element exterior calculus. We also construct $hp$-bounded projection operators satisfying a commuting diagram property and $hp$-stable Hodge decompositions. Numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Expression Rates of Neural Operators for Linear Elliptic PDEs in Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximation rates of a class of deep neural network approximations of operators, which arise as data-to-solution maps $\mathcal{G}^\dagger$ of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), and act between pairs $X,Y$ of suitable infinite-dimensional spaces. We prove expression rate bounds for approximate neural operators $\mathcal{G}$ with the structure $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{A} \circ \mathcal{E}$, with linear encoders $\mathcal{E}$ and decoders $\mathcal{R}$. The constructive proofs are via a recurrent NN structure obtained by unrolling exponentially convergent, self-consistent (``Richardson'') iterations. We bound the operator approximation error with respect to the linear Kolmogorov $N$-widths of the data and solution sets and in terms of the size of the approximation network. We prove expression rate bounds for approximate, neural solution operators emulating the coefficient-to-solution maps for elliptic PDEs set in $d$-dimensional polytopes, with $d\in\{2,3\}$, and subject to Dirichlet-, Neumann- or mixed boundary conditions. Exploiting weighted norm characterizations of the solution sets of elliptic PDEs in polytopes, we show algebraic rates of expression for problems with data with finite regularity, and exponential operator expression rates for analytic data.</description>

      <title>Efficient and stable time integration of Cahn-Hilliard equations: explicit, implicit and explicit iterative schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation numerically, a new time integration algorithm is proposed, which is based on a combination of the Eyre splitting and the local iteration modified (LIM) scheme. The latter is employed to tackle the implicit system arising each time integration step. The proposed method is gradient-stable and allows to use large time steps, whereas, regarding its computational structure, it is an explicit time integration scheme. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate abilities of the new method and to compare it with other time integration methods for Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a $C^0$-conforming virtual element method (VEM) for a class of second-order quasilinear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions. We present a posteriori error analysis for this problem and derive a residual based error estimator. The estimator is fully computable and we prove upper and lower bounds of the error estimator which are explicit in the local mesh size. We use the estimator to drive an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm. A handful of numerical test problems are carried out to study the performance of the proposed error indicator.</description>

      <title>Explicit Local Time-Stepping for the Inhomogeneous Wave Equation with Optimal Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptivity and local mesh refinement are crucial for the efficient numerical simulation of wave phenomena in complex geometry. Local mesh refinement, however, can impose a tiny time-step across the entire computational domain when using explicit time integration. By taking smaller time-steps yet only inside locally refined regions, local time-stepping methods overcome the stringent CFL stability restriction imposed on the global time-step by a small fraction of the elements without sacrificing explicitness. In [21], a leapfrog based local time-stepping method was proposed for the inhomogeneous wave equation, which applies standard leapfrog time-marching with a smaller time-step inside the refined region. Here, to remove potential instability at certain time-steps, a stabilized version is proposed which leads to optimal L2-error estimates under a CFL condition independent of the coarse-to-fine mesh ratio. Moreover, a weighted transition is introduced to restore optimal H1-convergence when the source is nonzero across the coarse-to-fine mesh interface. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical error estimates and illustrate the usefulness of these improvements.</description>

      <title>Applications and Novel Regularization of the Thin-Film Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical no-slip boundary condition of the Navier-Stokes equations fails to describe the spreading motion of a droplet on a substrate due to the missing small-scale physics near the contact line. In this thesis, we introduce a novel regularization of the thin-film equation to model droplet spreading. The solution of the regularized thin-film equation -- the Geometric Thin-Film Equation is studied and characterized. Two robust numerical solvers are discussed, notably, a fast and mesh-free numerical scheme for simulating thin-film flows in two and three spatial dimensions. Moreover, we prove the regularity and convergence of the numerical solutions. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Geometric Thin-Film Equation with respect to a wide range of measure-valued initial conditions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Model aggregation: minimizing empirical variance outperforms minimizing empirical error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether deterministic or stochastic, models can be viewed as functions designed to approximate a specific quantity of interest. We propose a data-driven framework that aggregates predictions from diverse models into a single, more accurate output. This aggregation approach exploits each model's strengths to enhance overall accuracy. It is non-intrusive - treating models as black-box functions - model-agnostic, requires minimal assumptions, and can combine outputs from a wide range of models, including those from machine learning and numerical solvers. We argue that the aggregation process should be point-wise linear and propose two methods to find an optimal aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation (MEA), which minimizes the aggregate's prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation (MVA), which minimizes its variance. While MEA is inherently more accurate when correlations between models and the target quantity are perfectly known, Minimal Empirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), an empirical version of MVA - consistently outperforms Minimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA), the empirical counterpart of MEA, when these correlations must be estimated from data. The key difference is that MEVA constructs an aggregate by estimating model errors, while MEEA treats the models as features for direct interpolation of the quantity of interest. This makes MEEA more susceptible to overfitting and poor generalization, where the aggregate may underperform individual models during testing. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework in various applications, such as data science and partial differential equations, showing how it successfully integrates traditional solvers with machine learning models to improve both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Impact of opinion formation phenomena in epidemic dynamics: kinetic modeling on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, it became increasingly evident that individuals' thoughts and beliefs can have a strong impact on disease transmission. It becomes therefore important to understand how information and opinions on protective measures evolve during epidemics. To this end, incorporating the impact of social media is essential to take into account the hierarchical structure of these platforms. In this context, we present a novel approach to take into account the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and socially-structured opinion dynamics. Our work extends a conventional compartmental framework including behavioral attitudes in shaping public opinion and promoting the adoption of protective measures under the influence of different degrees of connectivity. The proposed approach is capable to reproduce the emergence of epidemic waves. Specifically, it provides a clear link between the social influence of highly connected individuals and the epidemic dynamics. Through a heterogeneity of numerical tests we show how this comprehensive framework offers a more nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics in the context of modern information dissemination and social behavior.</description>

Abstract: We present a new data-driven turbulence model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations called $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This new model, grounded on the already existing Vector Basis Neural Network, predicts separately the turbulent viscosity $\nu_t$ and the contribution of the Reynolds force vector that is not already accounted in $\nu_t$. Numerical experiments on the flow in a Square Duct show the better accuracy of the new model compared to the reference one.</description>

Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) in dimension one posed on the unbounded real line. Several previous works have considered the deep neural network approximation of NLS solutions from the numerical and theoretical point of view in the case of bounded domains. In this paper, we introduce a new PINNs method to treat the case of unbounded domains and provide rigorous bounds on the associated approximation error in terms of the energy and Strichartz norms, provided a reasonable integration scheme is available. Applications to traveling waves, breathers and solitons, as well as numerical experiments confirming the validity of the approximation are also provided as well.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of approximating and estimating classification functions that have their decision boundary in the $RBV^2$ space. Functions of $RBV^2$ type arise naturally as solutions of regularized neural network learning problems and neural networks can approximate these functions without the curse of dimensionality. We modify existing results to show that every $RBV^2$ function can be approximated by a neural network with bounded weights. Thereafter, we prove the existence of a neural network with bounded weights approximating a classification function. And we leverage these bounds to quantify the estimation rates. Finally, we present a numerical study that analyzes the effect of different regularity conditions on the decision boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Recent literature has advocated the use of randomized methods for accelerating the solution of various matrix problems arising throughout data science and computational science. One popular strategy for leveraging randomization is to use it as a way to reduce problem size. However, methods based on this strategy lack sufficient accuracy for some applications. Randomized preconditioning is another approach for leveraging randomization, which provides higher accuracy. The main challenge in using randomized preconditioning is the need for an underlying iterative method, thus randomized preconditioning so far have been applied almost exclusively to solving regression problems and linear systems. In this article, we show how to expand the application of randomized preconditioning to another important set of problems prevalent across data science: optimization problems with (generalized) orthogonality constraints. We demonstrate our approach, which is based on the framework of Riemannian optimization and Riemannian preconditioning, on the problem of computing the dominant canonical correlations and on the Fisher linear discriminant analysis problem. For both problems, we evaluate the effect of preconditioning on the computational costs and asymptotic convergence, and demonstrate empirically the utility of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Implementation of many statistical methods for large, multivariate data sets requires one to solve a linear system that, depending on the method, is of the dimension of the number of observations or each individual data vector. This is often the limiting factor in scaling the method with data size and complexity. In this paper we illustrate the use of Krylov subspace methods to address this issue in a statistical solution to a source separation problem in cosmology where the data size is prohibitively large for direct solution of the required system. Two distinct approaches, adapted from techniques in the literature, are described: one that uses the method of conjugate gradients directly to the Kronecker-structured problem and another that reformulates the system as a Sylvester matrix equation. We show that both approaches produce an accurate solution within an acceptable computation time and with practical memory requirements for the data size that is currently available.</description>

      <title>Complexes from Complexes: Finite Element Complexes in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hilbert complexes have become highly significant. Recent advances focus on creating new complexes using the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework, as shown by Arnold and Hu [Complexes from complexes. {\em Found. Comput. Math.}, 2021]. This paper extends their approach to three-dimensional finite element complexes. The finite element Hessian, elasticity, and divdiv complexes are systematically derived by applying techniques such as smooth finite element de Rham complexes, the $t$-$n$ decomposition, and trace complexes, along with related two-dimensional finite element analogs. Notably, the construction includes two reduction {operations} to address continuity differences in the BGG diagram, ultimately resulting in a comprehensive and effective framework for constructing finite element complexes, which have various applications in PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Decomposition and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sole aim of this book is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in Bayesian matrix decomposition in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning Bayesian matrix decomposition and given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of variational inference for conducting the optimization. We refer the reader to literature in the field of Bayesian analysis for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.
  This book is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important Bayesian matrix decomposition methods, e.g., real-valued decomposition, nonnegative matrix factorization, Bayesian interpolative decomposition, and the origin and complexity of the methods which shed light on their applications. The mathematical prerequisite is a first course in statistics and linear algebra. Other than this modest background, the development is self-contained, with rigorous proof provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Enhancing accuracy with an adaptive discretization for the non-local integro-partial differential equations involving initial time singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to construct an efficient and highly accurate numerical method to address the time singularity at $t=0$ involved in a class of time-fractional parabolic integro-partial differential equations in one and two dimensions. The $L2$-$1_\sigma$ scheme is used to discretize the time-fractional operator, whereas a modified version of the composite trapezoidal approximation is employed to discretize the Volterra operator. Subsequently, it helps to convert the proposed model into a second-order BVP in a semi-discrete form. The multi-dimensional Haar wavelets are then used for grid adaptation and efficient computations for the 2D problem, whereas the standard second-order approximations are employed to approximate the spatial derivatives for the 1D case. The stability analysis is carried out on an adaptive mesh in time. The convergence analysis leads to $O(N^{-2}+M^{-2})$ accurate solution in the space-time domain for the 1D problem having time singularity based on the $L^\infty$ norm for a suitable choice of the grading parameter. Furthermore, it provides $O(N^{-2}+M^{-3})$ accurate solution for the 2D problem having unbounded time derivative at $t=0$. The analysis also highlights a higher order accuracy for a sufficiently smooth solution resides in $C^3(\overline{\Omega}_t)$ even if the mesh is discretized uniformly. The truncation error estimates for the time-fractional operator, integral operator, and spatial derivatives are presented. Numerous tests are performed on several examples in support of the theoretical analysis. The advancement of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through the application of the time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation and the fractional-order viscoelastic dynamics having weakly singular kernels. It also confirms the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing approaches available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pseudospectral Shattering and Inverse-Free Matrix Pencil Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a randomized, inverse-free algorithm for producing an approximate diagonalization of any $n \times n$ matrix pencil $(A,B)$. The bulk of the algorithm rests on a randomized divide-and-conquer eigensolver for the generalized eigenvalue problem originally proposed by Ballard, Demmel, and Dumitriu [Technical Report 2010]. We demonstrate that this divide-and-conquer approach can be formulated to succeed with high probability provided the input pencil is sufficiently well-behaved, which is accomplished by generalizing the recent pseudospectral shattering work of Banks, Garza-Vargas, Kulkarni, and Srivastava [Foundations of Computational Mathematics 2022]. In particular, we show that perturbing and scaling $(A,B)$ regularizes its pseudospectra, allowing divide-and-conquer to run over a simple random grid and in turn producing an accurate diagonalization of $(A,B)$ in the backward error sense. The main result of the paper states the existence of a randomized algorithm that with high probability (and in exact arithmetic) produces invertible $S,T$ and diagonal $D$ such that $||A - SDT^{-1}||_2 \leq \varepsilon$ and $||B - ST^{-1}||_2 \leq \varepsilon$ in at most $O \left(\log^2 \left( \frac{n}{\varepsilon} \right) T_{\text{MM}}(n) \right)$ operations, where $T_{\text{MM}}(n)$ is the asymptotic complexity of matrix multiplication. This not only provides a new set of guarantees for highly parallel generalized eigenvalue solvers but also establishes nearly matrix multiplication time as an upper bound on the complexity of inverse-free, exact arithmetic matrix pencil diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the iterative decoupling of elliptic-parabolic problems such as poroelasticity, we introduce time discretization schemes up to order $5$ based on the backward differentiation formulae. Its analysis combines techniques known from fixed-point iterations with the convergence analysis of the temporal discretization. As main result, we show that the convergence depends on the interplay between the time step size and the parameters for the contraction of the iterative scheme. Moreover, this connection is quantified explicitly, which allows for balancing the single error components. Several numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theoretical results, including a three-dimensional example from biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of the cubic interpolated pseudo-particle scheme for one-dimensional advection equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error estimates of cubic interpolated pseudo-particle scheme (CIP scheme) for the one-dimensional advection equation with periodic boundary conditions are presented. The CIP scheme is a semi-Lagrangian method involving the piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation. Although it is numerically known that the space-time accuracy of the scheme is third order, its rigorous proof remains an open problem. In this paper, denoting the spatial and temporal mesh sizes by $ h $ and $ \Delta t $ respectively, we prove an error estimate $ O(\Delta t^3 + \frac{h^4}{\Delta t}) $ in $ L^2 $ norm theoretically, which justifies the above-mentioned prediction if $ h = O(\Delta t) $. The proof is based on properties of the interpolation operator; the most important one is that it behaves as the $ L^2 $ projection for the second-order derivatives. We remark that the same strategy perfectly works as well to address an error estimate for the semi-Lagrangian method with the cubic spline interpolation.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Systems for Differential Equations with Polynomially Distributed Delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider delay differential equations with a polynomially distributed delay. We derive an equivalent system of delay differential equations, which includes just two discrete delays. The stability of the equivalent system and its stationary solutions are investigated. Alternatively, a Gaussian quadrature generates a discretisation of the integral, which describes the distributed delay in the original delay differential equation. This technique yields an approximate differential equation with multiple discrete delays. We present results of numerical computations, where initial value problems of the differential equations are solved. Therein, the two approaches are compared.</description>

      <title>Step-based checkpointing with high-level algorithmic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated code generation allows for a separation between the development of a model, expressed via a domain specific language, and lower level implementation details. Algorithmic differentiation can be applied symbolically at the level of the domain specific language, and the code generator reused to implement code required for an adjoint calculation. However the adjoint calculations are complicated by the well-known problem of storing or recomputing the forward data required by the adjoint, and different checkpointing strategies have been developed to tackle this problem. This article considers the combination of high-level algorithmic differentiation with step-based checkpointing schedules, with the primary application being for solvers of time-dependent partial differential equations. The focus is on algorithmic differentiation using a dynamically constructed record of forward operations, where the precise structure of the original forward calculation is unknown ahead-of-time. In addition, high-level approaches provide a simplified view of the model itself. This allows data required to restart and advance the forward, and data required to advance the adjoint, to be identified. The difference between the two types of data is here leveraged to implement checkpointing strategies with improved performance.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing Monte Carlo: Generating low-discrepancy point sets via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrepancy is a well-known measure for the irregularity of the distribution of a point set. Point sets with small discrepancy are called low-discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for low dimension and small number of points, i.e., for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined. Code for generating MPMC points can be found at https://github.com/tk-rusch/MPMC.</description>

      <title>Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming for Stochastic Optimization with Random Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider solving optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming method to find both first- and second-order stationary points. Our method utilizes a random model to represent the objective function, which is constructed from stochastic observations of the objective and is designed to satisfy proper adaptive accuracy conditions with a high but fixed probability. To converge to first-order stationary points, our method computes a gradient step in each iteration defined by minimizing a quadratic approximation of the objective subject to a (relaxed) linear approximation of the problem constraints and a trust-region constraint. To converge to second-order stationary points, our method additionally computes an eigen step to explore the negative curvature of the reduced Hessian matrix, as well as a second-order correction step to address the potential Maratos effect, which arises due to the nonlinearity of the problem constraints. Such an effect may impede the method from moving away from saddle points. Both gradient and eigen step computations leverage a novel parameter-free decomposition of the step and the trust-region radius, accounting for the proportions among the feasibility residual, optimality residual, and negative curvature. We establish global almost sure first- and second-order convergence guarantees for our method, and present computational results on CUTEst problems, regression problems, and saddle-point problems to demonstrate its superiority over existing line-search-based stochastic methods.</description>
