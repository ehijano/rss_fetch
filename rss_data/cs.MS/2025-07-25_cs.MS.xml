      <title>Building an Accelerated OpenFOAM Proof-of-Concept Application using Modern C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern trend in High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves the use of accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) alongside Central Processing Units (CPUs) to speed up numerical operations in various applications. Leading manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD are constantly advancing these architectures, augmenting them with features such as mixed precision, enhanced memory hierarchies, and specialised accelerator silicon blocks (e.g., Tensor Cores on GPU or AMX/SME engines on CPU) to enhance compute performance. At the same time, significant efforts in software development are aimed at optimizing the use of these innovations, seeking to improve usability and accessibility. This work contributes to the state-of-the-art of OpenFOAM development by presenting a working Proof-Of-Concept application built using modern ISO C++ parallel constructs. This approach, combined with an appropriate compiler runtime stack, like the one provided by the NVIDIA HPC SDK, makes it possible to accelerate well-defined kernels, allowing multi-core execution and GPU offloading using a single codebase. The study demonstrates that it is possible to increase the performance of the OpenFOAM laplacianFoam application by offloading the computations on NVIDIA GPUs using the C++ parallel construct.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>
