      <title>Human Mobility in the Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metaverse promises a shift in the way humans interact with each other, and with their digital and physical environments. The lack of geographical boundaries and travel costs in the metaverse prompts us to ask if the fundamental laws that govern human mobility in the physical world apply. We collected data on avatar movements, along with their network mobility extracted from NFT purchases. We find that despite the absence of commuting costs, an individuals inclination to explore new locations diminishes over time, limiting movement to a small fraction of the metaverse. We also find a lack of correlation between land prices and visitation, a deviation from the patterns characterizing the physical world. Finally, we identify the scaling laws that characterize meta mobility and show that we need to add preferential selection to the existing models to explain quantitative patterns of metaverse mobility. Our ability to predict the characteristics of the emerging meta mobility network implies that the laws governing human mobility are rooted in fundamental patterns of human dynamics, rather than the nature of space and cost of movement.</description>

      <title>ALAAMEE: Open-source software for fitting autologistic actor attribute models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) is a model for social influence, derived from the more widely known exponential-family random graph model (ERGM). ALAAMs can be used to estimate parameters corresponding to multiple forms of social contagion associated with network structure and actor covariates. This work introduces ALAAMEE, open-source Python software for estimation, simulation, and goodness-of-fit testing for ALAAM models. ALAAMEE implements both the stochastic approximation and equilibrium expectation (EE) algorithms for ALAAM parameter estimation, including estimation from snowball sampled network data. It implements data structures and statistics for undirected, directed, and bipartite networks. We use a simulation study to assess the accuracy of the EE algorithm for ALAAM parameter estimation and statistical inference, and demonstrate the use of ALAAMEE with empirical examples using both small (fewer than 100 nodes) and large (more than 10 000 nodes) networks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Insights into the Origins of Degree Bias in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often perform better for high-degree nodes than low-degree nodes on node classification tasks. This degree bias can reinforce social marginalization by, e.g., sidelining authors of lowly-cited papers when predicting paper topics in citation networks. While researchers have proposed numerous hypotheses for why GNN degree bias occurs, we find via a survey of 38 degree bias papers that these hypotheses are often not rigorously validated, and can even be contradictory. Thus, we provide an analysis of the origins of degree bias in message-passing GNNs with different graph filters. We prove that high-degree test nodes tend to have a lower probability of misclassification regardless of how GNNs are trained. Moreover, we show that degree bias arises from a variety of factors that are associated with a node's degree (e.g., homophily of neighbors, diversity of neighbors). Furthermore, we show that during training, some GNNs may adjust their loss on low-degree nodes more slowly than on high-degree nodes; however, with sufficiently many epochs of training, message-passing GNNs can achieve their maximum possible training accuracy, which is not significantly limited by their expressive power. Throughout our analysis, we connect our findings to previously-proposed hypotheses for the origins of degree bias, supporting and unifying some while drawing doubt to others. We validate our theoretical findings on 8 common real-world networks, and based on our theoretical and empirical insights, describe a roadmap to alleviate degree bias.</description>

      <title>A classification of well-behaved graph clustering schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.
  We study the class of all clustering methods that are monotone under addition of vertices and edges, phrasing this as a functoriality notion. We show that if additionally we require the methods to have no resolution limit in a strong sense, this is equivalent to a notion of representability, which requires them to be explainable and determined by a representing set of graphs. We show that representable clustering methods are always computable in polynomial time, and in any nowhere dense class they are computable in roughly quadratic time.
  Finally, we extend our definitions to the case of hierarchical clustering, and give a notion of representability for hierarchical clustering schemes.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Representation for Political Information Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of computational social science, many scholars utilize data analysis and natural language processing tools to analyze social media, news articles, and other accessible data sources for examining political and social discourse. Particularly, the study of the emergence of echo-chambers due to the dissemination of specific information has become a topic of interest in mixed methods research areas. In this paper, we analyze data collected from two news portals, Breitbart News (BN) and New York Times (NYT) to prove the hypothesis that the formation of echo-chambers can be partially explained on the level of an individual information consumption rather than a collective topology of individuals' social networks. Our research findings are presented through knowledge graphs, utilizing a dataset spanning 11.5 years gathered from BN and NYT media portals. We demonstrate that the application of knowledge representation techniques to the aforementioned news streams highlights, contrary to common assumptions, shows relative "internal" neutrality of both sources and polarizing attitude towards a small fraction of entities. Additionally, we argue that such characteristics in information sources lead to fundamental disparities in audience worldviews, potentially acting as a catalyst for the formation of echo-chambers.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>

      <title>Truncated Affinity Maximization: One-class Homophily Modeling for Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a one-class homophily phenomenon, which is one prevalent property we find empirically in real-world graph anomaly detection (GAD) datasets, i.e., normal nodes tend to have strong connection/affinity with each other, while the homophily in abnormal nodes is significantly weaker than normal nodes. However, this anomaly-discriminative property is ignored by existing GAD methods that are typically built using a conventional anomaly detection objective, such as data reconstruction. In this work, we explore this property to introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly scoring measure for GAD, local node affinity, that assigns a larger anomaly score to nodes that are less affiliated with their neighbors, with the affinity defined as similarity on node attributes/representations. We further propose Truncated Affinity Maximization (TAM) that learns tailored node representations for our anomaly measure by maximizing the local affinity of nodes to their neighbors. Optimizing on the original graph structure can be biased by nonhomophily edges (i.e., edges connecting normal and abnormal nodes). Thus, TAM is instead optimized on truncated graphs where non-homophily edges are removed iteratively to mitigate this bias. The learned representations result in significantly stronger local affinity for normal nodes than abnormal nodes. Extensive empirical results on 10 real-world GAD datasets show that TAM substantially outperforms seven competing models, achieving over 10% increase in AUROC/AUPRC compared to the best contenders on challenging datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/TAM-master/.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Fraud Detection over Heterogeneous Temporal MMMA Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of the click farm business using Multi-purpose Messaging Mobile Apps (MMMAs) tempts cybercriminals to perpetrate crowdsourcing frauds that cause financial losses to click farm workers. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive multi-view learning method named CMT for crowdsourcing fraud detection over the heterogeneous temporal graph (HTG) of MMMA. CMT captures both heterogeneity and dynamics of HTG and generates high-quality representations for crowdsourcing fraud detection in a self-supervised manner. We deploy CMT to detect crowdsourcing frauds on an industry-size HTG of a representative MMMA WeChat and it significantly outperforms other methods. CMT also shows promising results for fraud detection on a large-scale public financial HTG, indicating that it can be applied in other graph anomaly detection tasks. We provide our implementation at https://github.com/KDEGroup/CMT.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor methods for nonuniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multilinear algebra appears natural for studying the multiway interactions modeled by hypergraphs, tensor methods for general hypergraphs have been stymied by theoretical and practical barriers. A recently proposed adjacency tensor is applicable to nonuniform hypergraphs, but is prohibitively costly to form and analyze in practice. We develop tensor times same vector (TTSV) algorithms for this tensor which improve complexity from $O(n^r)$ to a low-degree polynomial in $r$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms. We also show these tensor measures offer complementary information to analogous graph-reduction approaches on data, and are also able to detect higher-order structure that many existing matrix-based approaches provably cannot.</description>

      <title>What we can learn from TikTok through its Research API</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TikTok is a social media platform that has gained immense popularity over the last few years, particularly among younger demographics, due to the viral trends and challenges shared worldwide. The recent release of a free Research API opens the door to collecting data on posted videos, associated comments, and user activities. Our study focuses on evaluating the reliability of the results returned by the Research API, by collecting and analyzing a random sample of TikTok videos posted in a span of 6 years. Our preliminary results are instrumental for future research that aims to study the platform, highlighting caveats on the geographical distribution of videos and on the global prevalence of viral and conspiratorial hashtags.</description>
