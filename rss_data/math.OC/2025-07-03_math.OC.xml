      <title>An Error Bound for Aggregation in Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general aggregation framework for discounted finite-state infinite horizon dynamic programming (DP) problems. It defines an aggregate problem whose optimal cost function can be obtained off-line by exact DP and then used as a terminal cost approximation for an on-line reinforcement learning (RL) scheme. We derive a bound on the error between the optimal cost functions of the aggregate problem and the original problem. This bound was first derived by Tsitsiklis and van Roy [TvR96] for the special case of hard aggregation. Our bound is similar but applies far more broadly, including to soft aggregation and feature-based aggregation schemes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Programming Principle for Stochastic Control Problems on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the dynamic programming principle for stochastic optimal control problems defined on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary. Subsequently, we derive the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function. We then prove the existence, uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the HJB equation, along with their continuous dependence on initial data and model parameters. Finally, under appropriate regularity conditions on the value function, we establish a verification theorem that characterizes optimal controls.</description>

      <title>Randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an abstract framework for randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization, which unifies and generalizes a broad class of existing algorithms, including domain decomposition, multigrid, and block coordinate descent methods. We provide a convergence rate analysis ranging from minimal assumptions to more practical settings, such as sharpness and strong convexity. While most existing studies on block coordinate descent methods focus on nonoverlapping decompositions and smooth or strongly convex problems, our framework extends to more general settings involving arbitrary space decompositions, inexact local solvers, and problems with limited smoothness or convexity. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to convex optimization problems arising in areas such as nonlinear partial differential equations, imaging, and data science.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Discrete-time LQG Mean Field Social Control Problems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the discrete-time linear-quadratic-Gaussian mean field (MF) social control problem in an infinite horizon, where the dynamics of all agents are unknown. The objective is to design a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to approximate the decentralized asymptotic optimal social control in terms of two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs). In this problem, a coupling term is introduced into the system dynamics to capture the interactions among agents. This causes the equivalence between model-based and model-free methods to be invalid, which makes it difficult to directly apply traditional model-free algorithms. Firstly, under the assumptions of system stabilizability and detectability, a model-based policy iteration algorithm is proposed to approximate the stabilizing solution of the AREs. The algorithm is proven to be convergent in both cases of semi-positive definite and indefinite weight matrices. Subsequently, by adopting the method of system transformation, a model-free RL algorithm is designed to solve for asymptotic optimal social control. During the iteration process, the updates are performed using data collected from any two agents and MF state. Finally, a numerical case is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Path Planning Model for Intercepting a Moving Target with Finite Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing a two-dimensional optimal curvature straight line (CS) shortest path for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to intercept a moving target, with both the UAV (pursuer) and target travelling at constant speeds. We formulate an optimal control problem that integrates two critical objectives: avoiding static obstacles and successfully intercepting the target. The approach introduces constraints derived from obstacle avoidance and target interception requirements. A geometric framework is developed, along with sufficient conditions for path optimality under the imposed constraints. The problem is initially examined in the presence of a single obstacle and later extended to scenarios involving a finite number of obstacles. Numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed model using illustrative examples. Finally, we present a realistic case study using actual geographic data, including obstacle placement, target trajectory, and heading angles, to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban aerial mobility is rapidly expanding, specifically on-demand Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) delivery services in urban environments. This necessitates management of the low-altitude airspace network to ensure smooth and safe traffic throughput. This study introduces a novel three-dimensional aerial network design inspired by a terrestrial transportation graph network for UAV networked mobility. Utilizing two-way tube corridors for node-to-node delivery and a spherical roundabout model, as "Sphereabout", to optimize the traffic flow through the spherical intersection. Through this architecture, three-dimensional conflict-free air mobility management can be achieved via numerical experiments and utilizing the geometrical features of this intersection.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the convex relaxation of the barrier parameter functional of self-concordant barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-concordant barriers are essential for interior-point algorithms in conic programming. To speed up the convergence it is of interest to find a barrier with the lowest possible parameter for a given cone. The barrier parameter is a non-convex function on the set of self-concordant barriers on a given cone, and finding an optimal barrier amounts to solving a non-convex infinite-dimensional optimization problem. In this work we study the degradation of the optimal value of the problem when the problem is convexified, and provide an estimate of the accuracy of the convex relaxation. The amount of degradation can be computed by comparing a 1-parameter family of non-convex bodies in $R^3$ with their convex hulls. Our study provides insight into the degree of non-convexity of the problem and opens up the possibility of constructing suboptimal barriers by solving the convex relaxation</description>

      <title>Predictive Energy Management for Mitigating Load Altering Attacks for Islanded Microgrids Using Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of smart devices controlling loads opens a potential pathway for false data attacks which could alter the loads. The presence of energy storage with its ability to quickly respond to discrepancies in loads offers a promising solution for security by preventing further instabilities and potential blackouts. This paper proposes a control methodology for secure predictive energy management that uses batteries to mitigate the impact of load-altering attacks. To that extent, we develop a microgrid model along with the primary control for microgrid. The developed models and the optimization algorithm are validated through a real-time numerical simulation of a modified IEEE 9 bus system involving a battery as one of the energizing sources. The results show the effectiveness of the battery in countering the load alterations.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of a higher-order extrapolation primal-dual interior-point method for nonlinear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A trajectory-following primal--dual interior-point method solves nonlinear optimization problems with inequality and equality constraints by approximately finding points satisfying perturbed Karush--Kuhn--Tucker optimality conditions for a decreasing order of perturbation controlled by the barrier parameter. Under some conditions, there is a unique local correspondence between small residuals of the optimality conditions and points yielding that residual, and the solution on the barrier trajectory for the next barrier parameter can be approximated using an approximate solution for the current parameter. A framework using higher-order derivative information of the correspondence is analyzed in which an extrapolation step to the trajectory is first taken after each decrease of the barrier parameter upon reaching a sufficient approximation. It suffices asymptotically to only take extrapolation steps for convergence at the rate the barrier parameter decreases with when using derivative information of high enough order. Numerical results for quadratic programming problems are presented using extrapolation as accelerator.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems under a local Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature -- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice -- this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios. However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge, we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth. Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Bound for Robust Quantum Gate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$ that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case (and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge \Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations. Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.</description>

      <title>Neural Hamiltonian Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization challenges inherent to this class of models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Revolution Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization With Very Sparse Mesh Pseudospectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems are important and challenging in space mission design. In this paper, an efficient, accurate, and widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various objective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman transformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is monotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle. Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few seconds of computational time for challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Enriching the Felsenthal index with a priori unions for decision-making processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the domain of game theory, power indexes are defined as functions that quantify the influence of individual participants in collective decision-making processes. Felsenthal [D. Felsenthal. A Well-Behaved Index of a Priori P-Power for Simple N-Person Games. Homo Oeconomicus, 33, 2016] proposed a power index with a focus on least size winning coalitions, i.e., those coalitions capable of determining the final outcome and with the smallest number of players among all winning coalitions. However, the Felsenthal index overlooks pre-existing affinities between the players, a common and impactful factor in real-world political and economic contexts. This paper introduces the Felsenthal Owen power index, a novel index based on Felsenthal's approach that integrates player affinities using Owen's a priori unions framework. The new index is rigorously characterised by two distinct sets of axiomatic properties. We demonstrate its practical utility by applying it to the International Monetary Fund's voting system, revealing how strategic alliances significantly reshape power distributions. The index thus offers policymakers a more sophisticated tool for measuring influence in complex decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Re-examining the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Pseudospectral Methods for Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudospectral methods represent an efficient approach for solving optimal control problems. While Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) collocation points have traditionally been considered inferior to Legendre-Gauss (LG) and Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points in terms of convergence properties, this paper presents a rigorous re-examination of LGL-based methods. We introduce an augmented formulation that enhances the standard LGL collocation approach by incorporating an additional degree of freedom (DOF) into the interpolation structure. We demonstrate that this augmented formulation is mathematically equivalent to the integral formulation of the LGL collocation method. Through analytical derivation, we establish that the adjoint system in both the augmented differential and integral formulations corresponds to a Lobatto IIIB discontinuous collocation method for the costate vector, thereby resolving the previously reported convergence issues. Our comparative analysis of LG, LGR, and LGL collocation methods reveals significant advantages of the improved LGL approach in terms of discretized problem dimensionality and symplectic integration properties. Numerical examples validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the proposed LGL-based method achieves comparable accuracy to LG and LGR methods while offering superior computational performance for long-horizon optimal control problems due to the preservation of symplecticity.</description>

      <title>An RRT* algorithm based on Riemannian metric model for optimal path planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Riemannian metric-based model to solve the optimal path planning problem on two-dimensional smooth submanifolds in high-dimensional space. Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height, ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace. The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.</description>

      <title>A trust-region framework for optimization using Hermite kernel surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a trust-region optimization framework that employs Hermite kernel surrogate models. The method targets optimization problems with computationally demanding objective functions, for which direct optimization is often impractical due to expensive function evaluations. To address these challenges, we leverage a trust-region strategy, where the objective function is approximated by an efficient surrogate model within a local neighborhood of the current iterate. In particular, we construct the surrogate using Hermite kernel interpolation and define the trust-region based on bounds for the interpolation error. As mesh-free techniques, kernel-based methods are naturally suited for medium- to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, the Hermite formulation incorporates gradient information, enabling precise gradient estimates that are crucial for many optimization algorithms. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments, which illustrate the convergence behavior as well as the efficiency gains compared to direct optimization.</description>

      <title>Scheduling on identical machines with conflicts to minimize the mean flow time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scheduling jobs on identical machines with conflict constraints, where certain jobs cannot be scheduled simultaneously on different machines. We focus on the case where conflicts can be represented by a simple undirected graph, and the objective is to minimize the mean flow time. We show that the problem is NP-hard even on two machines and two distinct processing times. For unit-time jobs, the problem becomes NP-hard when the number of machines increases to three. We also identify polynomial-time solvable cases for specific classes of conflict graphs. For the general problem, we propose mathematical models, lower bounds, and a genetic algorithm. We evaluate their performance through computational experiments on a wide range of instances derived from well-known benchmark instances in the literature.</description>

      <title>Global Energy Minimization for Simplex Mesh Optimization: A Radius Ratio Approach to Sliver Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of simplex mesh is crucial for the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations in finite element analysis and computational geometry. However, the presence of sliver elements in 3D simplex mesh can severely impact the results. This paper presents a novel method based on a radius ratio energy function to optimize the quality of simplex mesh elements. This method can effectively eliminate sliver elements, thereby enhancing mesh quality.The gradient of the proposed energy function can be decomposed into a matrix-vector product. With minor processing, the matrix becomes symmetric positive definite, and this symmetric positive definite matrix can serve as a preconditioner to significantly accelerate the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in eliminating sliver elements and improving mesh quality.</description>

      <title>Mind the jumps: when 2BSDEs meet semi-martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an aggregated version of the value processes associated with stochastic control problems, where the criterion to optimise is given by solutions to semi-martingale backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The results can be applied to control problems where the triplet of semi-martingale characteristics is controlled in a possibly non-dominated case or where uncertainty about the characteristics is present in the optimisation. The construction also provides a time-consistent system of fully nonlinear conditional expectations on the Skorokhod space. We find the semi-martingale decomposition of the value function and characterise it as the solution to a semi-martingale second-order BSDE. The generality we seek allows for the treatment of controlled diffusions, pure-jump processes, and discrete-time processes in a unified setting.</description>

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>Automatic Rank Determination for Low-Rank Adaptation via Submodular Function Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Preconditioning for Time-Dependent Variational Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of a time-dependent variational mean field game system with local couplings and either periodic or Neumann boundary conditions. Following a variational approach, we employ a finite difference discretization and solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimization problem using the Chambolle--Pock primal--dual algorithm. As this involves computing proximal operators and solving ill-conditioned linear systems at each iteration, we propose a general class of parallel-in-time preconditioners based on diagonalization techniques using discrete Fourier transforms. These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers with robustness across a wide range of viscosities. We further develop fast solvers for the resulting ill-conditioned systems arising at each time step, using exact recursive schemes for structured grids while allowing for other geometries. Numerical experiments confirm the improved performance and parallel scalability of our approach.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to serve both as a gentle introduction and a coherent overview of state-of-the-art Frank--Wolfe algorithms, also called conditional gradient algorithms, for function minimization. These algorithms are especially useful in convex optimization when linear optimization is cheaper than projections.
  The selection of the material has been guided by the principle of highlighting crucial ideas as well as presenting new approaches that we believe might become important in the future, with ample citations even of old works imperative in the development of newer methods. Yet, our selection is sometimes biased, and need not reflect consensus of the research community, and we have certainly missed recent important contributions. After all the research area of Frank--Wolfe is very active, making it a moving target. We apologize sincerely in advance for any such distortions and we fully acknowledge: We stand on the shoulder of giants.</description>

Abstract: The methodology of funnel control was introduced in the early 2000s, and it has developed since then in many respects achieving a level of mathematical maturity balanced by practical applications. Its fundamental tenet is the attainment of prescribed transient and asymptotic behaviour for continuous-time controlled dynamical processes encompassing linear and nonlinear systems described by functional differential equations, differential-algebraic systems, and partial differential equations. Considered are classes of systems specified by structural properties - such as relative degree and stable internal dynamics - of the systems only, the precise systems' data are in general unknown; the latter reflects the property that in general any model of a dynamical process is not precise. Prespecified are: a funnel shaped through the choice of a smooth function and freely chosen by the designer, a fairly large class of smooth reference signals, and a system class satisfying certain structural properties. The aim is to design, based on the structural assumptions and the input and output information only, a single `simple' control strategy -- called the funnel controller -- so that its application to any system of the given class and to any reference signal results in feasibility of the funnel control objective: that is solutions of the closed-loop system do not exhibit blow-up in finite time, all variables are bounded, and -- most importantly -- the evolution of the error between the system's output and the reference signal remains within the prespecified funnel. In the Introduction, we describe the genesis of funnel control. After that, we investigate diverse system classes amenable to funnel control. Funnel control is shown for systems with arbitrary relative degree and systems described by partial differential equations. Finally, we discuss input constraints and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic graphon mean field games (LQ-GMFGs) with common noise, in which a large number of agents are coupled via a weighted undirected graph. One special feature, compared with the well-studied graphon mean field games, is that the states of agents are described by the dynamic systems with the idiosyncratic noises and common noise. The limit LQ-GMFGs with common noise are formulated based on the assumption that these graphs lie in a sequence converging to a limit graphon. By applying the spectral decomposition method, the existence of solution for the formulated limit LQ-GMFGs is derived. Moreover, based on the adequate convergence assumptions, a set of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium strategies for the finite large population problem is constructed.</description>

      <title>Learning with Linear Function Approximations in Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems with finite state and action spaces where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Adaptive Control of Freeway Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty and delayed reactions in human driving behavior lead to stop-and-go traffic congestion on freeways. The freeway traffic dynamics are governed by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models with unknown relaxation time. Motivated by the adaptive traffic control problem, this paper presents a neural operator (NO) based adaptive boundary control design for the coupled 2$\times$2 hyperbolic systems with uncertain spatially varying in-domain coefficients and boundary parameter. In traditional adaptive control for PDEs, solving backstepping kernel online is computationally intensive, as it requires significant resources at each time step to update the estimation of coefficients. To address this challenge, we use operator learning, i.e. DeepONet, to learn the mapping from system parameters to the kernels functions. DeepONet, a class of deep neural networks designed for approximating operators, has shown strong potential for approximating PDE backstepping designs in recent studies. Unlike previous works that focus on approximating single kernel equation associated with the scalar PDE system, we extend this framework to approximate PDE kernels for a class of the first-order coupled 2$\times$2 hyperbolic kernel equations. Our approach demonstrates that DeepONet is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than traditional PDE solvers for generating kernel functions, while maintaining a loss on the order of $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Small-signal stability of power systems with voltage droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of research. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring small-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$ droop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of each bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter control strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The analysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex frequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the small-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power imbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design considerations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase theorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and lines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to established inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our conditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters that are misconfigured and cause instability.</description>

      <title>A Cahn--Hilliard--Willmore phase field model for non-oriented interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new phase field model for representing non-oriented interfaces, approximating their area and simulating their area-minimizing flow. Our contribution is related to the approach proposed in arXiv:2105.09627 that involves ad hoc neural networks. We show here that, instead of neural networks, similar results can be obtained using a more standard variational approach that combines a Cahn-Hilliard-type functional involving an appropriate non-smooth potential and a Willmore-type stabilization energy. We give a $\Gamma$-convergence analysis of this phase field model in dimension $1$ and, for radially symmetric functions, in arbitrary dimension. We also propose a simple numerical scheme to approximate its $L^2$-gradient flow. We illustrate numerically that the new flow approximates fairly well the mean curvature flow of codimension $1$ or $2$ interfaces in dimensions $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>Electricity Market Bidding for Renewable Electrolyzer Plants: An Opportunity Cost Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen produced through electrolysis with renewable power is considered key to decarbonize several hard-to-electrify sectors. This work proposes a novel approach to model the active electricity market participation of co-located renewable energy and electrolyzer plants, based on opportunity-cost bidding. While a renewable energy plant typically has zero marginal cost, selling power to the grid carries a potential opportunity-cost of not producing hydrogen when it is co-located with a hydrogen electrolyzer. We first consider only the electrolyzer, and derive its revenue of consuming electricity based on the non-convex hydrogen production curve. We then consider the available renewable energy production and form a piece-wise linear cost curve representing the opportunity cost of selling (or revenue from consuming) various levels of electricity. This cost curve can be used to model a stand-alone electrolyzer or a co-located hydrogen and renewable energy plant participating in an electricity market. Our case study analyzes the effects of market-bidding electrolyzers on electricity markets and grid operations. We compare two strategies for a co-located electrolyzer-wind plant; one based on the proposed bid curve and one with a more conventional fixed electrolyzer consumption. The results show that electrolyzers that actively participate in the electricity market lower the average cost of electricity and the amount of curtailed renewable energy in the system compared with a fixed consumption case. However, the difference in total system emissions between the two strategies is insignificant. The specific impacts vary based on electrolyzer capacity and hydrogen price, which determines the location of the co-located plant in the electricity market merit order.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of quasilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient terms and pointwise constraints on the gradient of the state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive existence results and first order necessary optimality conditions for optimal control problems governed by quasilinear parabolic PDEs with a class of first order nonlinearities that include for instance quadratic gradient terms. Pointwise in space and time or averaged in space and pointwise in time constraints on the gradient of the state control the growth of the nonlinear terms. We rely on and extend the improved regularity analysis for quasilinear parabolic PDEs on a whole scale of function spaces from [Hoppe et al, 2023]. In case of integral in space gradient-constraints we derive first-order optimality conditions under rather general regularity assumptions for domain, coefficients, and boundary conditions, similar to e.g. [Bonifacius and Neitzel, 2018]. In the case of pointwise in time and space gradient-constraints we use slightly stronger regularity assumptions leading to a classical smoother $W^{2,p}$-setting similar to [Casas and Chrysafinos, 2018].</description>

      <title>Predictive Control Barrier Functions: Bridging model predictive control and control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between model predictive control (MPC) techniques and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Recognizing the similarity between CBFs and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs), we propose a MPC formulation that ensures invariance and safety without relying on explicit stability conditions. The value function of our proposed MPC is a CBF, which we refer to as the Predictive Control Barrier Function (PCBF), similar to traditional MPC formulations which encode stability by having value functions as CLFs. Our formulation is simpler than previous PCBF approaches and is based on weaker assumptions while proving a similar theorem that guarantees safety recovery. Notably, our MPC formulation does not require the value function to be strictly decreasing to ensure convergence to a safe invariant set. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in guaranteeing safety and constructing non-conservative CBFs.</description>

      <title>A Teacher-Student MPC-PPO Coupled Reinforcement Learning Framework for Winter Temperature Control of Solar Greenhouses in Northern China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar greenhouses are crucial infrastructure of modern agricultural production in northern China. However, highly fluctuating temperature in winter season results in poor greenhouse temperature control, which affects crop growth and increases energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, an advanced control system that can efficiently optimize multiple objectives under dramatic climate conditions is essential. Therefore, this study propose a model predictive control-coupled proximal policy optimization (MPC-PPO) control framework. A teacher-student control framework is constructed in which the MPC generating high-quality control experiences to guide the PPO agent's learning process. An adaptive dynamic weighting mechanism is employed to balance the influence of MPC experiences during PPO training. Evaluation conducted in solar greenhouses across three provinces in northern China (Beijing, Hebei, and Shandong) demonstrates that: (1) the MPC-PPO method achieved the highest temperature control performance (96.31 on a 100-point scale), with a 5.46-point improvement compared to the non-experience integration baseline, when reduced standard deviation by nearly half and enhanced exploration efficiency; (2) the MPC-PPO method achieved a ventilation control reward of 99.19, optimizing ventilation window operations with intelligent time-differentiated strategies that reduced energy loss during non-optimal hours; (3) feature analysis reveals that historical window opening, air temperature, and historical temperature are the most influential features for effective control, i.e., SHAP values of 7.449, 4.905, and 4.747 respectively; and (4) cross-regional tests indicated that MPC-PPO performs best in all test regions, confirming generalization of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an adversarial deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) algorithm for high-dimensional stochastic control problems. Inspired by the information relaxation duality, ADRL reformulates the control problem as a min-max optimization between policies and adversarial penalties, enforcing non-anticipativity while preserving optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate ADRL's superior performance to yield tight dual gaps. Our results highlight the potential of ADRL as a robust computational framework for high-dimensional stochastic control in simulation-based optimization contexts.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of the Push-Pull Method for Decentralized Optimization over Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear speedup property is essential for demonstrating the advantage of distributed algorithms over their single-node counterparts. In this paper, we study the stochastic Push-Pull method, a widely adopted decentralized optimization algorithm over directed graphs (digraphs). Unlike methods that rely solely on row-stochastic or column-stochastic mixing matrices, Push-Pull avoids nonlinear correction and has shown superior empirical performance across a variety of settings. However, its theoretical analysis remains challenging, and the linear speedup property has not been generally establishe--revealing a significant gap between empirical success and limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis framework and prove that Push-Pull achieves linear speedup over arbitrary strongly connected digraphs. Our results provide the comprehensive theoretical understanding for stochastic Push-Pull, aligning its theory with empirical performance. Code: https://github.com/pkumelon/PushPull.</description>

      <title>Momentum Does Not Reduce Stochastic Noise in Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02325v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For nonconvex objective functions, including those found in training deep neural networks, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum is said to converge faster and have better generalizability than SGD without momentum. In particular, adding momentum is thought to reduce stochastic noise. To verify this, we estimated the magnitude of gradient noise by using convergence analysis and an optimal batch size estimation formula and found that momentum does not reduce gradient noise. We also analyzed the effect of search direction noise, which is stochastic noise defined as the error between the search direction of the optimizer and the steepest descent direction, and found that it inherently smooths the objective function and that momentum does not reduce search direction noise either. Finally, an analysis of the degree of smoothing introduced by search direction noise revealed that adding momentum offers limited advantage to SGD.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyse the small-time reachability properties of a nonlinear parabolic equation, by means of a bilinear control, posed on a torus of arbitrary dimension $d$. Under a saturation hypothesis on the control operators, we show the small-time approximate controllability between states sharing the same sign. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case $d=1$, we combine this property with a local exact controllability result, and prove the small-time exact controllability of any positive states towards the ground state of the evolution operator.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware and Routing-Flexible Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests (also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and manage network resources to meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Matching with Post-allocation Service and its Application to Refugee Resettlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by our collaboration with a major refugee resettlement agency in the U.S., we study a dynamic matching problem where each new arrival (a refugee case) must be matched immediately and irrevocably to one of the static resources (a location with a fixed annual quota). In addition to consuming the static resource, each case requires post-allocation services from a server, such as a translator. Given the uncertainty in service time, a server may not be available at a given time, thus we refer to it as a dynamic resource. Upon matching, the case will wait to avail service in a first-come-first-serve manner. Bursty matching to a location may result in undesirable congestion at its corresponding server. Consequently, the central planner (the agency) faces a dynamic matching problem with an objective that combines the matching reward (captured by pair-specific employment outcomes) with the cost for congestion for dynamic resources and over-allocation for the static ones. Motivated by the observed fluctuations in the composition of refugee pools across the years, we aim to design algorithms that do not rely on distributional knowledge. We develop learning-based algorithms that are asymptotically optimal in certain regimes, easy to interpret, and computationally fast. Our design is based on learning the dual variables of the underlying optimization problem; however, the main challenge lies in the time-varying nature of the dual variables associated with dynamic resources. Our theoretical development brings together techniques from Lyapunov analysis, adversarial online learning, and stochastic optimization. On the application side, when tested on real data from our partner agency and incorporating practical considerations, our method outperforms existing ones making it a viable candidate for replacing the current practice upon experimentation.</description>

      <title>optimizn: a Python Library for Developing Customized Optimization Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are prevalent across a wide variety of domains. These problems are often nuanced, their optimal solutions might not be efficiently obtainable, and they may require lots of time and compute resources to solve (they are NP-hard). It follows that the best course of action for solving these problems is to use general optimization algorithm paradigms to quickly and easily develop algorithms that are customized to these problems and can produce good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present optimizn, a Python library for developing customized optimization algorithms under general optimization algorithm paradigms (simulated annealing, branch and bound). Additionally, optimizn offers continuous training, with which users can run their algorithms on a regular cadence, retain the salient aspects of previous runs, and use them in subsequent runs to potentially produce solutions that get closer and closer to optimality. An earlier version of this paper was peer reviewed and published internally at Microsoft.</description>

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.</description>
