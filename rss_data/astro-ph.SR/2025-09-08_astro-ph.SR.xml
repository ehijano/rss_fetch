      <title>Multi-color characterization of optically invisible FU Orionis-type outbursts: Demonstration and prospects for the WINTER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.</description>

      <title>More Old Dogs, More New Tricks: Photographic Plates of the Globular Cluster M10 (NGC 6254) Digitized wit a Commercial Scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photographic plates of the globular cluster M10 (NGC 6254) that were recorded at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory between 1931 and 1934 have been digitized with a commercial scanner. The plates have numerous cosmetic issues, and the results are used to assess the information that can be extracted from such archival data. After performing a series of basic processing steps, a plate-to-plate dispersion in photometric measurements &lt; 10% is delivered between V = 13 and 15. The light curves of known variables are constructed and evidence is presented for long term variations in the mean brightnesses of the W Vir star V3, as well as the semi-regular (SR) variable V29. Two new variable stars are identified, although cluster membership is possible for only one of these. A brightness-selected sample of candidate variable stars identified in the GAIA database that are not in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars is also examined, and some show variability in the plate photometry. Parallaxes indicate that five of the GAIA variables are at the same distance as M10. Four of the GAIA variables fall along the horizontal branch of M10 on the color-magnitude diagram. Another GAIA variable is located close to the cluster center, and may be evolving on the supra-horizontal branch. The plate photometry suggests that the Gaia variable with the most secure M10 membership based on parallax, proper motions, and velocity is an SR variable that is offset by a projected distance of 9 parsecs from the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Coronal Hole by a quiet-Sun Filament Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coronal hole formed as a result of a quiet-Sun filament eruption close to the solar disk center on 2014 June 25. We studied this formation using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis derived from the AIA images. The coronal hole developed in three stages: (1) formation, (2) migration, and (3) stabilization. In the formation phase, the emission measure (EM) and temperature started to decrease six hours before the filament erupted. Then, the filament erupted and a large coronal dimming formed over the following three hours. Subsequently, in a phase lasting $15.5$~hours, the coronal dimming migrated by 150" from its formation site to a location where potential field source surface extrapolations indicate the presence of open magnetic field lines, marking the transition into a coronal hole. During this migration, the coronal hole drifted across quasi-stationary magnetic elements in the photosphere, implying the occurrence of magnetic interchange reconnection at the boundaries of the coronal hole. In the stabilization phase, the magnetic properties and area of the coronal hole became constant. The EM of the coronal hole decreased, which we interpret as a reduction in plasma density due to the onset of plasma outflow into interplanetary space. As the coronal hole rotated towards the solar limb, it merged with a nearby pre-existing coronal hole. At the next solar rotation, the coronal hole was still apparent, indicating a lifetime of &gt;1 solar rotation.</description>

      <title>Extremely diverse coronal jets accompanying an erupting filament captured by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets are collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, which play a critical role in the energy release and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Using Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) with its unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, we report the discovery of nine transient coronal jets associated with a filament eruption on September 30, 2024. These jets, with a median lifetime of only 22 seconds, have significantly shorter timescales than previously observed coronal jets. They exhibit diverse morphologies and properties, evolving through three distinct phases of the filament eruption: initiation, rise, and peak. The spatial and temporal distribution of the jets suggests they are driven by dynamic magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and overlying magnetic fields. These jets represent a distinct class of phenomena different from traditional mini-filament-driven jets, being directly associated with large-scale filament eruption processes. This study reveals a previously unrecognised class of highly transient jets, highlighting the complexity of reconnection-driven processes during filament eruptions and underscoring the importance of high-resolution observations in uncovering fundamental plasma dynamics in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Solar Orbiter reveals persistent magnetic reconnection in medium-scale filament eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filament eruptions play a key role in driving space weather, yet their fine-scale evolution remains poorly understood due to observational limitations. Using unprecedented high-resolution observations from Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (105 km/pixel) and Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager, we reveal persistent magnetic reconnection events in a failed filament eruption. We identify magnetic reconnections between the filament and surrounding magnetic field structures, with both frequency and type far exceeding previous observations. These reconnections significantly affect the filament stability and eruption dynamics, leading to sequential coronal jets and failed eruptions. We propose a 'persistent magnetic cutting' concept, highlighting how persistent small-scale magnetic reconnections cumulatively affect filament stability during its evolution.</description>

      <title>s-process Enriched Post-AGB Star J003643.94-723722.1 in the SMC with an Extreme C/O Ratio and the First Precise Detection of Lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are exquisite tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis via their surface abundances. We present a comprehensive analysis of J003643.94$-$723722.1 (J003643), a single SMC post-AGB star, using high-resolution UVES/VLT spectra analysed with E-iSpec. We find C/O = 16.21 and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20 \mathrm{dex}$. We also report the first direct Pb detection in a post-AGB star from the Pb II 5608.853 A line, with $[\mathrm{Pb}/\mathrm{Fe}]=3.18\,\mathrm{dex}$. Comparison with post-AGB samples in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds reveals that J003643 has an unusually high C/O ratio. J003643's $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]=1.33\pm0.14 \mathrm{dex}$ and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ are consistent with third dredge-up enrichment, but its $[\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{Fe}]=-0.08\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ is low relative to objects of similar $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Together with $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\approx0\,\mathrm{dex}$ at $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]\approx-1\,\mathrm{dex}$, consistent with SMC chemical evolution, this indicates the high C/O chiefly reflects oxygen deficiency rather than exceptional carbon enrichment. Additionally, we compare the full abundance pattern with yields from ATON, MONASH and FRUITY (the latter two with post-processing nucleosynthesis). Most elements are reproduced, but Pb is strongly underpredicted, highlighting a persistent gap in models of heavy-element production in AGB stars. The photospheric chemistry of J003643 adds to the growing diversity among post-AGB stars and underscores the complexity of AGB nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>XRISM observations of solar flare X-ray emission reflected in the Earth's atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched into low-Earth orbit in 2023, observes the reflection of solar flare X-rays in the Earth's atmosphere as a by-product of celestial observations. Using a $\sim$one-year data set covering from October 2023 to November 2024, we report on our first results of the measurement of the metal abundance pattern and high-resolution Fe-K spectroscopy. The abundances of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe measured with the CCD detector Xtend during M- and X-class flares show the inverse-first-ionization-potential (inverse-FIP) effect, which is consistent with the results of Katsuda et al., ApJ, 2020 using the Suzaku satellite. The abundances of Si, S, and Ar are found to decrease with increasing flare magnitude, which is consistent with the theoretical model by Laming (Laming, ApJ, 2021), whereas Ca exhibits an opposite trend. The large effective area and field of view of Xtend allow us to trace the evolution of the abundances in several X-class flare loops on a timescale of a few 100 s, finding an enrichment of low-FIP elements before flare peaks. The high-resolution Fe-K spectrum obtained with the microcalorimeter Resolve successfully separates the Rayleigh- and Compton-scattered Fe XXIV/XXV lines and neutral or low-ionized Fe-K$\alpha$ lines. The neutral/low-ionized Fe-K$\alpha$ equivalent width shows an anti-correlation with hard X-ray flux with the best-fit power-law slope of $-0.14 \pm 0.09$, suggesting that hard X-rays from flare loops are stimulating the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence. This work demonstrates that XRISM can be a powerful tool in the field of solar physics, offering valuable high-statistic CCD data and high-resolution microcalorimeter spectra in the energy range extending to the Fe-K band.</description>

      <title>Heating and cooling at a coronal magnetic null</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductive cooling of the solar corona at a magnetic null is examined. An initial equilibrium is set up, balancing thermal conduction and a constant, spatially uniform coronal heating. The heating is then turned off and the subsequent conductive cooling calculated. An equation for the cooling is obtained using the method of separation of variables and it is shown that the equations for the equilibrium between conduction and heating, and the time-dependent cooling are mathematically identical with a simple change of variables. Thus the properties of the cooling phase are automatically determined by the equilibrium state. For a two-dimensional null, the characteristic cooling timescale increases over that in a straight field by a factor of between 2 and 5, with a scaling determined by the ratio of the {\it{average}} and base areas of a flux element. There is {\it{no explicit dependence}} on the very large areas that can arise near the null.</description>

      <title>The Variable Radio Emission of V830 Tau and Its Putative Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first moderate-length time-scale observations of a young stellar object (YSO) at microwave frequencies. V830 Tau was monitored over the course of eight days with the JVLA at a frequency range of 4-8 GHz. Previous brief radio observations of this purported planet-hosting star indicated a radio-bright source with sparse evidence of dramatic intensity changes. Our observations confirm variability larger than a factor of five over the 8 days, with closer-spaced data indicating a long-lived flare event spanning multiple days. We discuss a hypothesis that the large, long-duration radio flare may be produced as a result of magnetospheric interaction between the star and its purported planet, using multi-year monitoring of a few active binary systems with the Green Bank Interferometer to augment our discussion. Although we cannot disentangle the effect of the large stellar surface area from any effects of orbital separation, the disputed star-planet system would have a large amount of power generated from stretching and breaking of magnetic fields. If this long-duration flare behavior repeats with additional data on timescales close to the planetary orbital period, microwave signatures of interacting magnetospheres could be a new observational tool to confirm the existence of planets around young, magnetically active stars.</description>

      <title>The pre-eruption state of T CrB as observed with ALMA in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T CrB is a nearby symbiotic binary and a recurrent nova with a period of ca. 80 years. The next eruption is expected to take place in 2025 or 2026. We present our pre-eruption observations made in ALMA frequency Bands 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in August to November 2024 and constrain the properties of the environment into which the imminent next nova will erupt.
  We find that in the second half of 2024, the quiescent T CrB was a faint mm source with a spectral energy distribution well described by a powerlaw with index $\alpha=$0.56$\pm$0.11 and a flux density of ca. 0.1 mJy at 44 GHz and 0.4 mJy at 400 GHz. There is no significant line emission. This is in agreement with expectations for free-free emission from the partially ionized wind of the red giant donor star and, in extrapolation to 35 GHz, a factor 5 fainter than the emission observed in 2016/17 during the latest high state. Comparing the spectra from that high-state between 13.5 GHz and 35 GHz with our spectrum from 2024, our spectrum is softer. The spectral index is on average lower by 0.34$\pm$0.11 . Our per-band and aggregate bandwidth images of T CrB show an unresolved point source with no evidence for extended structure.
  A simple model of a free-free emitting, fully-ionized stellar wind seems to describe well the 2016/17 high state of T CrB but not our 2024 ALMA measurements with their low flux and high turnover frequency suggesting that in 2024, the wind was far from fully ionized.

      <title>Identification of recurrent novae from parametric modeling of the optical light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novae, characterized by sudden brightening in binary star systems, are categorized into classical novae (CNe) and recurrent novae (RNe) based on their recurrence timescales. However, identifying RNe, which occur within 100 years, presents observational challenges. A reasonable signature of RNe has been theorized and statistically validated to address this -- the presence of a plateau in the optical light curve. Among the known RNe, except T CrB and V3890 Sgr displaying S-class light curve, the rest 9 out of 11 have a P-class light curve. But classical novae can also present plateaus, which further complicates the problem of distinguishing CNe from RNe just based on plateau. Hence, in this study, we aim to conduct a phenomenological analysis of P-class light curves to comment on the recurrence nature of novae. We utilize data primarily from the AAVSO database and identify a parameter space to represent all P-class light curves, anticipating distinct parameter distributions for CNe and RNe. Analysis of parameter distributions successfully distinguishes RNe from CNe and reveals potential connections with white dwarf mass and mass accretion rate, which are the key factors. Our method indicates KT Eri to be a recurrent nova, consistent with a recent study, despite only one observed outburst. The analysis also indicates the possibility of recurrence for V2860 Ori, a prediction that may be tested by deep search for nova super-remnant for this source. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing P-class classical and recurrent novae based solely on the optical light curve. As observations of new novae increase, this method holds promise for more precise predictions of nova recurrence nature in the future.</description>

      <title>Gaseous disks in white dwarfs: properties of the current sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the number of white dwarfs (WDs) showing infrared (IR) excesses, attributed to circumstellar dust disks, has grown significantly. Gaseous disks have also been detected in some WDs with dust. We obtained optical spectra with Gemini/GMOS for thirteen WDs exhibiting IR excesses to search for gaseous components. No Ca II emission was detected, suggesting the gas phase may be short-lived compared to the dusty stage. Combining our data with literature, we compiled the largest sample of WDs with and without gas disks. We find no significant differences in stellar properties between the two groups, although disks with gas may be, on average, brighter. The detection rate of Ca II emission supports the idea that the gas phase persists for only a fraction of the total disk lifetime. A more definitive assessment will likely require dedicated searches for both gas and dust across large WD samples.</description>

      <title>Observations of Flare Induced Doppler Shifts in the Si~\textsc{iii} $1206\,\textrm{{\AA}}$ line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler shifts in chromospheric and transition-region lines during solar flares are often interpreted as chromospheric condensation or evaporation. However, alternative sources of Doppler-shifted emission have been suggested, such as filament eruptions, jets or chromospheric bubbles. We analyse high-cadence scans from SORCE/SOLSTICE, which provide one-minute resolution profiles of the transition-region Si~\textsc{iii} ($1206\,\textrm{{\AA}}$, $\textrm{T} = 10^{4.6}\,\textrm{K}$) line. 11 X-, M-, and C-class events observed during these scans with clear impulsive phase Si~\textsc{iii} enhancements were identified. By subtracting a quiet-Sun profile and fitting Gaussian profiles to the Si~\textsc{iii} line, measurements of flare-induced Doppler shifts were made. After correcting for a systematic trend in these shifts with solar longitude, two of the 11 events were found to exhibit a significant Doppler shift, \comment{}one with a $201.36\pm21.94\;\textrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ redshift and the other with a $-39.75\pm11.00\;\textrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ blueshift\commentend{}. Intriguingly, SDO/AIA $304\,\textrm{{\AA}}$ and $1600\,\textrm{{\AA}}$ imaging revealed a bright eruption coincident with the event that exhibited a blueshift, suggesting the shift may have resulted from the eruption rather than evaporation alone. Our results highlight Si~\textsc{iii} as a useful diagnostic of flaring dynamics at a temperature that has received limited attention to date. Future comparisons of these observations with radiative hydrodynamic simulations, along with new observations from state-of-the-art spectrometers such as SOLAR-C/EUVST and MUSE, should clarify the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in this study.</description>

      <title>The solar sulphur abundance in view of large-scale atomic structure calculations and 3D non-LTE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar chemical composition is a fundamental yardstick in astrophysics and the topic of heated debate in recent literature. We re-evaluate the abundance of sulphur in the photosphere by studying seven S I lines in the solar disc-centre intensity spectrum. Our analysis considers independent sets of experimental and theoretical oscillator strengths together with, for the first time, three-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (3D non-LTE) S I spectrum synthesis. Our best estimate is $A(\mathrm{S})=7.06\pm0.04$, which is $0.06$ dex to $0.10$ dex lower than that in commonly-used compilations of the solar chemical composition. Our lower solar sulphur abundance deviates from that in CI chondrites, and thereby supports the case for a systematic difference between the composition of the solar photosphere and of CI chondrites that is correlated with $50\%$ condensation temperature. We suggest that precise laboratory measurements of S I oscillator strengths and abundance analyses using 3D magnetohydrodynamic models of the solar photosphere be conducted to further substantiate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Improving Solar Flare Nowcasting with the Hot Onset Precursor Event (HOPE) Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the statistical behavior of plasma properties during Hot Onset Precursor Events (HOPEs) of solar flares and evaluates their potential for improving flare nowcasting. Two datasets are analyzed: (a) new Soft X-Ray (SXR) spectra of 25 flares (C2.6 to M1.0) obtained from the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS), and (b) SXR irradiance data from 137 flares (C5.0 to X7.1) recorded by the X-Ray Sensor on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-XRS). Plasma temperature, emission measure (EM), and low First Ionization Potential (e.g., Mg, Si, Fe) elemental abundance factors (AFs) are derived from DAXSS using Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model fitting. Isothermal plasma temperature and emission measure are derived from GOES-XRS using the XRS-A/XRS-B ratio method. Results indicate that the HOPE phase exhibits elevated temperatures (10-15 MK) and an order-of-magnitude increase in EM before the impulsive phase. Elemental AFs show a transition from coronal to photospheric values as the flare progresses. Using GOES-XRS data, we develop an improved nowcasting algorithm that detects flares utilizing HOPE signatures. The algorithm is tested across three categories of flares (C5.0-M1.0, M1.0-X1.0, and X1.0+), consistently predicting flare alerts 5-15 minutes ahead of the flare peak. We also explore the possibility of approximate flare magnitude prediction, by calculating correlation between onset parameters and flare peak magnitude. This HOPE-based system shows potential for earlier warnings than current NOAA R3 alerts, which could be useful for High-frequency communication systems operators and targeted flare observation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. I. Orbital evolution due to conservative mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones. To date, no framework simultaneously accounts for both conservative and non-conservative MT across arbitrary eccentricities while also incorporating the donor star`s spin. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars as extended bodies and accounting for the donor star`s spin. The model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts stronger orbital widening at a given mass ratio than previous models. For circular orbits, we find that the transitional mass ratio $q_{trans,a}$, which separates orbital widening from shrinkage, increases from $q_{trans,a} = 1$ up to $q_{trans,a} \sim 1.5$ when accounting for extended bodies. For eccentric orbits, the model predicts a broader parameter space for both orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. We find that stable MT naturally explains the observed correlation between longer orbital periods and higher eccentricities, providing a robust mechanism for the formation of wide and eccentric post-interaction binaries. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of "black widow" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>Granulation on a quiet K dwarf: HD 166620 I. Spectral signatures as a function of line-formation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Radial velocity (RV) spectrographs reach unprecedented precision and stability below 1 m/s, the challenge of granulation in the context of exoplanet detection has intensified. Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves reveal the pair-instability mass gap and constrain nuclear burning in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theory predicts that electron--positron pair production in the cores of massive stars triggers unstable thermonuclear explosions that prevent the direct formation of black holes above about $50\,M_\odot$, creating a ``pair-instability gap''. Yet black holes have been detected above this mass with gravitational waves; such objects might be explained with uncertainties in the physics of massive stars and stellar collapse or with hierarchical mergers of black holes in stellar clusters. Hierarchical mergers are associated with large spins as predicted by general relativity, and isotropic spin orientations. Here we present strong evidence for the pair-instability mass gap in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA fourth transient catalog, with a lower edge at $45.3^{+6.5}_{-4.8}\,M_\odot$. We also obtain a measurement of the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, yielding an $S$-factor of $242.5^{+310.4}_{-101.5}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}$, a parameter critical for modeling helium burning and stellar evolution. The new data reveal two populations: a low-spin group with no black holes above the gap, consistent with direct stellar collapse, and a high-spin, isotropic group that extends across the full mass range and occupies the gap, consistent with hierarchical mergers. These findings confirm the role of pair-instability in shaping the black hole spectrum, establish a new link between gravitational-wave astronomy and nuclear astrophysics, and highlight hierarchical mergers and star cluster dynamics as key channels in the growth of black holes.</description>

      <title>SN 2022acko and the Properties of its Red Supergiant Progenitor: Direct Detection, Light Curves, and Nebular Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared observations of the Type II-P supernova SN 2022acko in NGC 1300, located at a distance of 19.0 +/- 2.9 Mpc. Our dataset spans 1-350 days post-explosion in photometry, complemented by late-time optical spectroscopy covering 200-600 days, and includes deep pre-explosion imaging. We use this extensive multiwavelength dataset for both direct and indirect constraints on the progenitor system. Using the early-time photometry and shock-cooling models, we infer that SN 2022acko likely originated from a red supergiant with a radius of R ~ 580 solar radii and an initial mass of M ~ 9-10 solar masses. From the radioactive decay tail, we infer a synthesized Ni56 mass of 0.014 +/- 0.004 solar masses. We further model nebular-phase spectra using radiative transfer models and nucleosynthesis yields for core-collapse supernovae, which suggest a progenitor initial mass in the range of 10-15 solar masses. Meanwhile, blackbody fitting of the detected pre-explosion counterpart in the F814W and F160W bands indicates a red supergiant with a lower initial mass of approximately 7.5 solar masses. The light curve exhibits a 116 days plateau, indicative of a massive hydrogen-rich envelope, inconsistent with the pre-explosion analysis. We investigated the discrepancy between direct and indirect progenitor mass estimates, focusing on the roles of binary interaction, early-time modeling limitations, and systematic uncertainties in spectral calibration. Our results indicate that the tension among mass estimates likely arises from modeling limitations and flux calibration uncertainties rather than from insufficient data, highlighting the need for more physically realistic models and a deeper understanding of systematic effects.</description>

      <title>Turbulence from CO observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.</description>

      <title>CO Depletion in Infrared Dark Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70, G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer, lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10 in regions with $n_H&gt;3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures &lt;18 K. We propose a functional form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and $T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical history of gas during the early stages of star formation.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>

Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>The jet-feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution of planetary nebula progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we mimic the negative jet feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution (CEE) of low-mass main sequence stars, M2=0.1-0.2Mo, spiraling inward inside the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or red giant branch (RGB) stars and find that the jets reduced the envelope density, therefore the jets' power, by a factor of ~0.5/(M2/0.1Mo). We mimic the energy that the jets deposit into the envelope by depositing energy into the outer envelope, a process that inflates the envelope, therefore reducing the density in the vicinity of the main sequence star, the accretion rate, and the jets' power. In deriving this expression for the negative jet feedback coefficient, we assume that the actual mass accretion rate is a fraction ~0.2-0.5 of the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion rate and that the jets carry a fraction ~0.25-0.5 of the accretion energy onto the main sequence star. Our study is another step in establishing the major role of jets in the onset and early phase of CEE, a possible grazing envelope evolution phase, and in transient events, such as luminous red novae, which these processes can power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the numerical algorithms of a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code utilizing the Yin-Yang grid, called the Yin-Yang Magnetic Flux Eruption (Yin-Yang-MFE) code, suitable for modeling the large-scale dynamical processes of the solar corona and the solar wind. It is a single-fluid MHD code taking into account the non-adiabatic effects of the solar corona, including the electron heat conduction, optically thin radiative cooling, and empirical coronal heating. We describe the numerical algorithms used to solve the set of MHD equations (with the semi-relativistic correction, or the Boris correction) in each of the partial spherical shell Yin Yang domains, and the method for updating the boundary conditions in the ghost-zones of the two overlapping domains with the code parallelized with the message passing interface (MPI). We validate the code performance with a set of standard test problems, and finally present a solar wind solution with a dipolar magnetic flux distribution at the solar surface, representative of solar minimum configuration.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Magnetic Field of a Coronal Mass Ejection from Low to Middle Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy have paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using gyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME associated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data in microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the microwave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the eruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in extreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into the middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart, observed by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using gyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of the erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal heights of 0.02 and 1.83 $R_{\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to be around 300 G at 0.02 $R_{\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G near the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 1.83 $R_{\odot}$. These results provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Hunt for Post-Red Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud II: Turbulent Line Broadening in the Spectra of LMC Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving towards the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially-stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly-understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically-significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from {\it Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the extremely long-period cataclysmic variables V479 Andromedae and V1082 Sagitarii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overwhelming majority of CVs have orbital periods shorter than 10 hr. However, a few have much longer periods, and their formation and existence pose challenges for the CV evolution models. These extremely long-period CVs must host nuclearly evolved donor stars, as otherwise, the companion of the white dwarf would be too small to fill its Roche lobe. This makes them natural laboratories for testing binary evolution models and accretion processes with subgiant donors. To shed light on the formation and evolution of accreting compact objects with subgiant companions, we investigated two extremely long-period CVs in detail, namely V479 And and V1082 Sgr. We searched for reasonable formation pathways to explain their refined stellar and binary parameters. We used a broad set of new observations, including ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, results of circular polarimetry, and improved Gaia distance estimates to determine fundamental parameters to be confronted with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we utilized the MESA code to conduct numerical simulations, employing state-of-the-art prescriptions, such as the CARB model for strong magnetic braking. Both systems have unusual chemical compositions and very low masses for their assigned spectral classes. This most likely indicates that they underwent thermal timescale mass transfer. We found models for both that can reasonably reproduce their properties. We conclude that the donor stars in both V479 And and V1082 Sgr are filling their Roche lobes. Our findings suggest that orbital angular momentum loss is stronger due to magnetic braking in CVs with subgiant donors compared to those with unevolved donors. In addition, our findings suggest that extremely long-period CVs could significantly contribute to the population of double white dwarf binaries in close orbits.</description>

Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, shows they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present study, we investigate the possible existence of negative charged kaons and neutral anti-kaons in neutron stars by employing the relativistic mean field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K}^{0}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to simultaneously explain the current variety of astrophysical objects, it is essential to resurrect a scenario of two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Machine Learning Driven Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline utilizing machine learning for classifying short-duration features in raw time-ordered data (TOD) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The pipeline, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources, in a process called ``data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The classification pipeline demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD preprocessing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90\% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94\% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our pipeline also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a subminute-to-minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated pipeline for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\sigma_\mathrm{max} \tau_a \propto \beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Pinched Magnetic Fields in the High-mass Protocluster W3 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.</description>
