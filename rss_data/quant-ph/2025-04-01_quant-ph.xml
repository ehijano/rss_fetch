      <title>Quantum Hermitian conjugate and encoding of unnormalized matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop the family of matrix-manipulation algorithms based on the encoding the matrix elements into the probability amplitudes of the pure superposition state of a certain quantum system. We introduce two extensions to these algorithms which allow (i) to perform Hermitian conjugation of matrices under consideration and (ii) to weaken the restriction to the absolute values of matrix elements unavoidably imposed by the normalization condition for a pure quantum state. Both these extensions are applied to the matrix multiplication algorithm. Controlled measurement of ancilla state is implemented to avoid the problem of small success probability in the measurement process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Models for Image Generation: Insights from MNIST and MedMNIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on quantum generative models is currently in its early exploratory stages, with very few established methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum generative model based on variational quantum circuits for image generation tasks, introducing innovative noise techniques specifically tailored for quantum computation. Our approach utilizes two distinctive noise strategies: quantum-generated noise inherent to quantum circuits, and a newly developed noise scheduling method, applying different noise levels strategically across time steps during the training process. Experiments conducted on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets demonstrate that our hybrid quantum model, combined with these specialized noise techniques, achieves promising results, suggesting improved generative performance compared to baseline quantum generative approaches. This exploratory work lays a critical foundation and opens new avenues for advancing quantum generative modeling research.</description>

      <title>Variational Perturbation Theory in Open Quantum Systems for Efficient Steady State Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the steady state of an open quantum system is crucial for characterizing quantum devices and studying various physical phenomena. Often, computing a single steady state is insufficient, and it is necessary to explore its dependence on multiple external parameters. In such cases, calculating the steady state independently for each combination of parameters quickly becomes intractable. Perturbation theory (PT) can mitigate this challenge by expanding steady states around reference parameters, minimizing redundant computations across neighboring parameter values. However, PT has two significant limitations: it relies on the pseudo-inverse -- a numerically costly operation -- and has a limited radius of convergence. In this work, we remove both of these roadblocks. First, we introduce a variational perturbation theory (VPT) and its multipoint generalization that significantly extends the radius of convergence even in the presence of non-analytic effects such as dissipative phase transitions. Then, we develop two numerical strategies that eliminate the need to compute pseudo-inverses. The first relies on a single LU decomposition to efficiently construct the steady state within the convergence region, while the second reformulates VPT as a Krylov space recycling problem and uses preconditioned iterative methods. We benchmark these approaches across various models, demonstrating their broad applicability and significant improvements over standard PT.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptography integrating an optical quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developments in scalable quantum networks rely critically on optical quantum memories, which are key components enabling the storage of quantum information. These memories play a pivotal role for entanglement distribution and long-distance quantum communication, with remarkable advances achieved in this context. However, optical memories have broader applications, and their storage and buffering capabilities can benefit a wide range of future quantum technologies. Here we present the first demonstration of a cryptography protocol incorporating an intermediate quantum memory layer. Specifically, we implement Wiesner's unforgeable quantum money primitive with a storage step, rather than as an on-the-fly procedure. This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime. We demonstrate the implementation with polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and a high-efficiency cold-atom-based quantum memory, and validate the full scheme. Our results showcase a major capability, opening new avenues for quantum memory utilization and network functionalities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Relieving the post-selection problem by quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurement is a fundamental yet experimentally challenging ingredient of quantum information processing. Many recent studies on quantum dynamics focus on expectation values of nonlinear observables; however, their experimental measurement is hindered by the post-selection problem -- namely, the substantial overhead caused by uncontrollable measurement outcomes. In this work, we propose a post-selection--free experimental strategy based on a fully quantum approach. The key idea is to deterministically simulate the post-selected quantum states by applying quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) algorithms. For pure initial state post-selection, our method is a generalization of fixed-point amplitude amplification to arbitrary projective measurements, achieving an optimal quadratic speedup. We further extend this framework to mixed initial state post-selection by applying linear amplitude amplification via QSVT, which significantly enhances the measurement success probability. However, a deterministic quantum algorithm for preparing the post-selected mixed state is generally impossible because of information-theoretic constraints imposed by quantum coding theory. Additionally, we introduce a pseudoinverse decoder for measurement-induced quantum teleportation. This decoder possesses the novel property that, when conditioned on a successful flag measurement, the decoding is nearly perfect even in cases where channel decoders are information-theoretically impossible. Overall, our work establishes a powerful approach for measuring novel quantum dynamical phenomena and presents quantum algorithms as a new perspective for understanding quantum dynamics and quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton quantum simulation of the generalized Hopfield memory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Quantum Interference at Ultracompact Inverse-Designed Multiport Beam Splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies enter a new phase when realized in photonic integrated circuits, leading to a great advance in practical applications. In the pursuit of high integration density and low circuit complexity, ultracompact devices delivered by topology optimization offer a promising solution to miniaturize these photonic systems even further. However, their potential for quantum experiments has not yet been fully explored despite the constant development. In this work, we demonstrate multiphoton quantum interference using a topology-optimized tritter with a size of 8.0 $\rm{\mu}$m $\times$ 4.5 $\rm{\mu}$m. We characterize the tritter and reconstruct its transfer matrix by means of single- and two-photon statistics. We also perform heralded three-photon quantum interference with the tritter. The measured four-fold coincidence features a peak with visibility of (-47.9$\pm$ 8.6)%, which is in fair agreement with the prediction of -55.8% estimated from the reconstructed transfer matrix. Our work confirms successful multiphoton quantum interference at an ultracompact interferometer and demonstrates the possibility of utilizing topology-optimized multiport interferometers in various fields of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Nonlinear Lindblad Master Equation Based on Quantum Trajectory Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 2-dilation digital simulation scheme for the non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) based on quantum trajectory averaging. The NLME continuously interpolates between full LME and the dynamical equation governed by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Remarkably, for standard LMEs, our scheme reduces to a 1-dilation method that enables deterministic realizations without postselection. This deterministic nature overcomes a key limitation in some existing simulation methods, where repeated postselections lead to exponentially vanishing implementation probabilities. Consequently, our scheme allows efficient long-time simulations of LMEs with multiple jump operators. As a demonstration, we present numerical experiments simulating novel theoretical predictions in open quantum systems, including localization in open quantum systems and the postselected skin effect.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum inputs in the prepare-and-measure scenario and stochastic teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate prepare-and-measure scenarios in which a sender and a receiver use entanglement to send quantum information over a channel with limited capacity. We formalise this framework, identify its basic properties and provide numerical tools for optimising quantum protocols for generic communication tasks. The seminal protocol for sending quantum information over a classical channel is teleportation. We study a natural stochastic generalisation in which the sender holds $N$ qubits from which the receiver can recover one on demand. We show that with two bits of communication alone, this task can be solved exactly for all $N$, if the sender and receiver have access to stronger-than-quantum nonlocality. We then consider entanglement-based protocols and show that these can be constructed systematically by leveraging connections to several well-known quantum information primitives, such as teleportation, cloning machines and random access coding. In particular, we show that by using genuine multi-particle entangled measurements, one can construct a universal stochastic teleportation machine, i.e.~a device whose teleportation fidelity is independent of the quantum input.</description>

      <title>Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Microring resonator-based photonic circuit for faithfully heralding NOON states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have designed a Micro-Ring Resonator (MRR) based device that allows for the post-selection of high order NOON states via heralding. NOON states higher than $N=2$ cannot be generated deterministically. By tuning the coupling parameters of the device we can minimize the amplitudes of the 'accidental' states to maximize the probability of obtaining the NOON state upon a successful heralding event. Our device can produce a 3-photon NOON state output with 100% certainty upon a successful heralding detection, which occurs with probability $\frac{8}{27}$ for optimal tunable device parameters. A successful heralding event allows for non-destructive time of flight tracking of the NOON state thus establishing a significantly enhanced level of engineering control for integration of the NOON state into scalable systems for quantum sensing and metrology. We further discuss extensions of our technique to even higher NOON states having $N=4,5$.</description>

      <title>From Quantum-Mechanical Acceleration Limits to Upper Bounds on Fluctuation Growth of Observables in Unitary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Speed Limits (QSLs) are fundamentally linked to the tenets of quantum mechanics, particularly the energy-time uncertainty principle. Notably, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound are prominent examples of QSLs. Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been proposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of change over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian operator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective Hilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass any observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This relationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any observable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like observable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of our inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables related to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a harmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware Time-optimal Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a vital role in many quantum technologies, including quantum computation. One of the most important control parameters to optimise for is the evolution time (pulse duration). However, most existing works focus on finding the shortest evolution time theoretically possible without offering explicit pulse constructions under practical constraints like noise in the system. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing an efficient method to perform the Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimisation in the presence of noise, specifically when the noise commutes with the gate Hamiltonian. This noise-aware approach allows for direct optimisation of the evolution time alongside other control parameters, significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full noisy simulations. The protocol is demonstrated through numerical simulations on state-to-state transfer and gate compilation problems under several noise models. Results show that the optimised fidelity has a strong dependence on evolution time due to noise, drift Hamiltonian, and local traps in optimisation, highlighting the necessity of optimising evolution time in practical settings that can lead to a substantial gain in the fidelity. Our pulse optimisation protocol can consistently reach the global optimal time and fidelity in all of our examples. We hope that our protocol can be the start of many more works on the crucial topic of control pulse time optimisation in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Preparing graph states forbidding a vertex-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford measurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are likely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so when preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required entangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.
  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we may focus on graph states $\left\vert G \right\rangle$. As a lower bound for general graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ is $\Omega(n^2 / \log n)$. We obtain significantly improved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs. For instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique number $\omega$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n \log \omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at most $k$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$ that we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.
  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the CZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural Conjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph contained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\log n)$. Since graph states of locally equivalent graphs are local Clifford equivalent, proper vertex-minor-closed classes of graphs are natural and very general in this setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</description>

      <title>CopyQNN: Quantum Neural Network Extraction Attack under Varying Quantum Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have shown significant value across domains, with well-trained QNNs representing critical intellectual property often deployed via cloud-based QNN-as-a-Service (QNNaaS) platforms. Recent work has examined QNN model extraction attacks using classical and emerging quantum strategies. These attacks involve adversaries querying QNNaaS platforms to obtain labeled data for training local substitute QNNs that replicate the functionality of cloud-based models. However, existing approaches have largely overlooked the impact of varying quantum noise inherent in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, limiting their effectiveness in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we propose the CopyQNN framework, which employs a three-step data cleaning method to eliminate noisy data based on its noise sensitivity. This is followed by the integration of contrastive and transfer learning within the quantum domain, enabling efficient training of substitute QNNs using a limited but cleaned set of queried data. Experimental results on NISQ computers demonstrate that a practical implementation of CopyQNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QNN extraction attacks, achieving an average performance improvement of 8.73% across all tasks while reducing the number of required queries by 90x, with only a modest increase in hardware overhead.</description>

      <title>Modified Hellmann Feynman Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the well-known Hellmann Feynman Theorem (HFT), originally developed for Hermitian systems to facilitate the calculation of forces among the molecules. Our work extends this foundational theorem to the domain of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, in particular the PT symmetric non-Hermitian quantum physics. We derive a modified form of the HFT (MHFT) which holds good for both PT broken, unbroken phases and even at the exceptional point of the theory as demonstrated with help of a discrete and a continumm model. Since a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian admits biorthonormal set of eigenvectors, a more appropriate inner product known as the G inner product is defined, based on which, the system in the unbroken phase can be shown to satisfy unitary time evolution, while a system in broken phase does not. We show here that the MHFT obtained is valid for both these situations.</description>

      <title>Collective charging of an organic quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective charging of a quantum battery (QB) consisting of a one-dimensional molecular aggregate and a coupled single-mode cavity, to which we refer as an ``organic quantum battery" since the battery part is an organic material. The organic QB can be viewed as an extension of the so-called Dicke QB [D. Ferraro \emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 117702 (2018)] by including finite exciton hopping and exciton-exciton interaction within the battery. We consider two types of normalizations of the exciton-cavity coupling when the size of the aggregate $N$ is increased: (I) The cavity length also increases to keep the density of monomers constant, (II) The cavity length does not change. Our main findings are that: (i) For fixed $N$ and exciton-cavity coupling, there exist optimal exciton-exciton interactions at which the maximum stored energy density and the maximum charging power density reach their respective maxima that both increase with increasing exciton-cavity coupling. The existence of such maxima for weak exciton-cavity coupling is argued to be due to the non-monotonic behavior of the one-exciton to two-exciton transition probability in the framework of second-order time-dependent perturbation theory. (ii) Under normalization I, no quantum advantage is observed in the scaling of the two quantities with varying $N$. Under normalization II, it is found that both the maximum stored energy density and the maximum charging power density exhibit quantum advantages compared with the Dicke QB.</description>

      <title>Output Prediction of Quantum Circuits based on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The output prediction of quantum circuits is a formidably challenging task imperative in developing quantum devices. Motivated by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, this paper proposes a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based framework to predict the output expectation values of quantum circuits under noisy and noiseless conditions and compare the performance of different parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). We construct datasets under noisy and noiseless conditions using a non-parameterized quantum gate set to predict circuit expectation values. The node feature vectors for GNNs are specifically designed to include noise information. In our simulations, we compare the prediction performance of GNNs in both noisy and noiseless conditions against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the same dataset and their qubit scalability. GNNs demonstrate superior prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Subsequently, we utilize the parameterized quantum gate set to construct noisy PQCs and compute the ground state energy of hydrogen molecules using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). We propose two schemes: the Indirect Comparison scheme, which involves directly predicting the ground state energy and subsequently comparing circuit performances, and the Direct Comparison scheme, which directly predicts the relative performance of the two circuits. Simulation results indicate that the Direct Comparison scheme significantly outperforms the Indirect Comparison scheme by an average of 36.2% on the same dataset, providing a new and effective perspective for using GNNs to predict the overall properties of PQCs, specifically by focusing on their performance differences.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo zeros and dynamical quantum phase transitions in finite-size quantum systems with linear quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal singularities in quench dynamics, characterized by the emergence of Loschmidt echo zeros at critical times, which usually exist only in the thermodynamical limit but are absent in finite size quantum systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical scheme to probe Loschmidt echo zeros and observe dynamical quantum phase transitions in finite size systems by applying a two-step quenching protocol, which offers an experimentally feasible approach to study Loschmidt echo zeros. Using the transverse Ising model as a testbed, we identify that the exact Loschmidt echo zeros can be always accessed by tuning the quench rate, when the quench is across the phase transition point. The associated rate function displays divergence at critical times, accompanying with the change of the dynamical topological order parameter. The critical times are influenced by the quench rate, system size, and momentum modes, embodying the interplay between finite-size effects and critical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight how the $L^2$ normalization required for embedding data in quantum states affects data centering, which can significantly influence quantum amplitude-encoded covariance matrices in quantum data analysis algorithms. We examine the spectra and eigenvectors of quantum covariance matrices derived from hyperspectral data under various centering scenarios. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that classification performance in problems reduced by principal component analysis remains unaffected, no matter if the data is centered or uncentered, provided that eigenvector filtering is handled appropriately.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at the first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent subharmonic motion of a many-Boson system subjected to an external time-periodic driving force. The underlying mechanism is exemplified numerically through analysis of a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard dimer, and clarified conceptually by semiclassical re-quantization of invariant tubes pertaining to the system's mean-field description. It is argued that even high-order subharmonic response can be systematically engineered, and be observed experimentally, with weakly interacting Floquet condensates comprising a sufficiently large number of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar rotors can be realized by confining molecular ions or charged nanoparticles together with atomic ions in a Paul trap. We study the case of molecular ions or charged nanoparticles that have an electric dipole moment which couples to modes of the common vibrational motion in the trap. We calculate the strength of the coupling with specific vibrational modes for rotor masses ranging from $10^2$ atomic units, as typical for diatomic molecules, to $10^{6}\,$ atomic units, corresponding to nanoclusters. Either, the coupling manifests as a resonant energy exchange between rotational states and one of ion crystal vibrational modes. Or, in the off-resonant case, the dipole-phonon coupling results in energy shifts. In both cases we discuss how the effect may be experimentally detected using sideband-resolved laser spectroscopy and measurements of decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</description>

      <title>Bright squeezed light in the kilohertz frequency band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largely technical noise of a free running laser is the fundamental limit for preparation of a bright squeezed light, especially within MHz band. We propose a novel bright squeezed light generation scheme in virtue of multiple noise stabilization scheme. The scheme assimilates the advantages of high loop gain of active stabilization in the range of low frequency, and broadband noise suppression properties of passive stabilization, respectively. A laser beam with technical noise far below the shot noise limit at 1 mW is experimentally realized among kHz to MHz frequency range, which creates the prerequisite conditions of preparing a broadband bright squeezed light. Integrating with an active noise suppression, the broadband technical noise suppression magnitude is furtherly improved by 9 dB, driving the generation of a bright squeezed light to the output power of 1 mW and the squeezing strength of 5.5 dB among kHz to MHz frequency band. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of a milliwatt-order bright squeezed light across the kilohertz band. The demonstration sheds light on potential applications of bright squeezed light in quantum metrology and might enable new concepts in the future.</description>

      <title>CNOT-Optimal Clifford Synthesis as SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford circuit optimization is an important step in the quantum compilation pipeline. Major compilers employ heuristic approaches. While they are fast, their results are often suboptimal. Minimization of noisy gates, like 2-qubit CNOT gates, is crucial for practical computing. Exact approaches have been proposed to fill the gap left by heuristic approaches. Among these are SAT based approaches that optimize gate count or depth, but they suffer from scalability issues. Further, they do not guarantee optimality on more important metrics like CNOT count or CNOT depth. A recent work proposed an exhaustive search only on Clifford circuits in a certain normal form to guarantee CNOT count optimality. But an exhaustive approach cannot scale beyond 6 qubits.
  In this paper, we incorporate search restricted to Clifford normal forms in a SAT encoding to guarantee CNOT count optimality. By allowing parallel plans, we propose a second SAT encoding that optimizes CNOT depth. By taking advantage of flexibility in SAT based approaches, we also handle connectivity restrictions in hardware platforms, and allow for qubit relabeling. We have implemented the above encodings and variations in our open source tool Q-Synth.
  In experiments, our encodings significantly outperform existing SAT approaches on random Clifford circuits. We consider practical VQE and Feynman benchmarks to compare with TKET and Qiskit compilers. In all-to-all connectivity, we observe reductions up to 32.1% in CNOT count and 48.1% in CNOT depth. Overall, we observe better results than TKET in the CNOT count and depth. We also experiment with connectivity restrictions of major quantum platforms. Compared to Qiskit, we observe up to 30.3% CNOT count and 35.9% CNOT depth further reduction.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Computing Moments for Exact Quantum Dynamics: Application to Arbitrary System-Bath Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general procedure for computing higher-order moments of correlation functions in open quantum systems, extending the scope of our recent work on Memory Kernel Coupling Theory (MKCT) [W. Liu, Y. Su, Y. Wang, and W. Dou, arXiv:2407.01923 (2024)]. This approach is demonstrated for arbitrary system-bath coupling that can be expressed as polynomial, $H_{SB} = \hat{V} (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{q} + \alpha_2 \hat{q}^2+ \dots)$, where we show that the recursive commutators of a system operator obey a universal hierarchy. Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings suggest a promising path toward accurate dynamics for complex open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement recycling in probabilistic port-based teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entangled resource state recycling after one round of probabilistic port-based teleportation. We analytically characterize its degradation and, for the case of the resource state consisting of $N$ EPR pairs, we demonstrate the possibility of reusing it for a subsequent round of teleportation in the $N \to \infty$ limit. For the case of an optimized resource state, we compare the protocol's performance to multi-port-based teleportation, indicating that the resource state reuse is possible.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning assisted noise classification with Quantum Key Distribution protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid protocol to classify quantum noises using supervised classical machine learning models and simple quantum key distribution protocols. We consider the quantum bit error rates (QBERs) generated in QKD schemes under consideration of different noises, and identify the noise channels with high accuracy for both training and test data. Our protocol classifies quantum noises with high accuracy under the assumption of two different scenarios; in one case we assume two remotely located parties share keys through noisy quantum channels, whereas, in the second case, we simulate the QKD protocols on a gate-based quantum computer, where the gates are afflicted with noise. Alongside efficient classification, our work also throws light on the difference in distribution characteristics of QBERs generated in these two scenarios. Finally, our method is based on classical post processing of data generated from very simplistic quantum protocols, making it readily implementable in the current era of noisy quantum computing with low number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Optimal Timing in Discriminating Quantum Dynamical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I address the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes. This problem is solved by identifying the optimal time at which two quantum channels, drawn from distinct sets of time-dependent channels, can be distinguished with minimal error probability, along with the optimal (potentially entangled) input state. I illustrate the richness of the solutions through an explicit study of Pauli dynamical maps and their corresponding sets of Pauli channels. Notably, I identify a scenario in which optimal discrimination without entanglement requires waiting indefinitely -- i.e., until the unknown process reaches its stationary state -- whereas the presence of entanglement allows for discrimination at a finite optimal time, along with a strict improvement in distinguishability.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization and synchronization of a quantum van der Pol oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical self-sustained oscillators, that generate periodic motion without periodic external forcing, are ubiquitous in science and technology. The realization of nonclassical self-oscillators is an important goal of quantum physics. We here present the experimental implementation of a quantum van der Pol oscillator, a paradigmatic autonomous quantum driven-dissipative system with nonlinear damping, using a single trapped atom. We demonstrate the existence of a quantum limit cycle in phase space in the absence of a drive and the occurrence of quantum synchronization when the nonlinear oscillator is externally driven. We additionally show that synchronization can be enhanced with the help of squeezing perpendicular to the direction of the drive and, counterintuitively, linear dissipation. We also observe the bifurcation to a bistable phase-space distribution for large squeezing. Our results pave the way for the exploration of self-sustained quantum oscillators and their application to quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</description>

      <title>Light-cone feature selection in methane hyperspectral images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) capture detailed spectral information across numerous contiguous bands, enabling the extraction of intrinsic characteristics of scanned objects and areas. This study focuses on the application of light-cone feature selection in quantum machine learning for methane detection and localization using HSIs. The proposed method leverages quantum methods to enhance feature selection and classification accuracy. The dataset used includes HSIs collected by the AVIRIS-NG instrument captured in geographically diverse locations. In this study, we investigate the performance of support vector machine classifiers with different classic and quantum kernels. The results indicate that the quantum kernel classifier, combined with light-cone feature selection, provides in one metric, superior performance when compared to the classic techniques. It demonstrates the potential of quantum machine learning in improving the remote sensing data analysis for environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-verified time distribution in a metropolitan network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise synchronization of distant clocks is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a novel approach of quantum clock synchronization utilizing entangled and correlated photon pairs generated by a quantum dot at telecom wavelength. By distributing these entangled photons through a metropolitan fiber network in the Stockholm area and measuring the remote correlations, we achieve a synchronization accuracy of tens of picoseconds by leveraging the tight time correlation between the entangled photons. We show that our synchronization scheme is secure against spoofing attacks by performing a remote quantum state tomography to verify the origin of the entangled photons. We measured a distributed maximum entanglement fidelity of $0.817 \pm 0.040$ to the $|\Phi^+\rangle$ Bell state and a concurrence of $0.660 \pm 0.086$. These results highlight the potential of quantum dot-generated entangled pairs as a shared resource for secure time synchronization and quantum key distribution in real-world quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Refined Quantum Algorithms for Principal Component Analysis and Solving Linear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline refined versions of two major quantum algorithms for performing principal component analysis and solving linear equations. Our methods are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts and even previous quantum algorithms/dequantization algorithms. Oracle/black-box access to classical data is not required, thus implying great capacity for near-term realization. Several applications and implications of these results are discussed. First, we show that a Hamiltonian $H$ with classically known rows/columns can be efficiently simulated, adding another model in addition to the well-known sparse access and linear combination of unitaries models. Second, we provide a simpler proof of the known result that quantum matrix inversion cannot achieve sublinear complexity $\kappa^{1-\gamma}$ where $\kappa$ is the conditional number of the inverted matrix.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in the electromagnetic interactions of Dirac and Weyl particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the study of the electromagnetic interactions of Dirac and Weyl particles, highlighting novel and significant findings. Specifically, we demonstrate that all Weyl particles, and under certain conditions Dirac particles, can occupy the same quantum state under an extensive range of electromagnetic 4-potentials and fields. These fields, which are infinite in number, have been explicitly derived and analysed. Additionally, we establish that Weyl particles can form localized states even in the absence of external electromagnetic fields. Moreover, we show that their localization can be precisely controlled through the application of simple electric fields, offering a tuneable mechanism for manipulating these particles. Building on these insights, we propose an innovative device that leverages Weyl fermions to regulate information flow at unprecedented rates of up to 100 petabits per second. This finding has significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic and quantum information technologies, as it presents a fundamentally new approach to high-speed data processing and transmission.</description>

      <title>High-Field NMR Enhanced Sensitivity via Nuclear Spin Locking with NV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state defects such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been utilized for NMR sensing at ambient temperatures for samples at the nano-scale and up to the micro-scale. Similar to standard NMR, NV-sensitivities can be increased using tesla-valued magnetic fields to boost nuclear thermal polarization, while structural parameters, such as chemical shifts, are also enhanced. However, with standard microwave (MW) based sensing techniques, NV centers struggle to track fast megahertz Larmor frequencies encountered in high-field scenarios. Previous protocols have addressed this by mapping target NMR parameters to the signal amplitude rather than the frequency, using a mediating RF field. Although successful, protocol sensitivities are limited by the coherence time ($T_2^*$) of the NMR signal owing to the presence of stages where the sample magnetization freely evolves. In this work, we propose extending this coherence time, and consequently improving sensitivity, via amplitude encoding with weak nuclear spin locking instead of free evolution, thereby taking advantage of the longer sample coherence times ($T_{1\rho}$). We demonstrate this can enhance protocol sensitivities by $\gtrsim 4$ times.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Dynamics and Trace Preserving Replica Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general methodology for addressing the infinite hierarchy problem that arises in measurement-induced dynamics of replicated quantum systems. Our approach introduces trace-preserving replica cutoffs using tomographic-like techniques to estimate higher-order replica states from lower ones, ensuring that partial trace reduction properties are rigorously maintained. This guarantees that the dynamics of single-replica systems correctly reduce to standard Lindblad evolution. By systematically mapping information between replica spaces of different orders, we characterise null spaces under partial trace operations and outline efficient algorithmic approaches to enforce positivity. Importantly, it is demonstrated that pre-calculated stochastic Gaussian ensembles of free fermion states provide an effective and computationally efficient means to stabilise the replica hierarchy, even in the presence of interactions. Numerical tests on small interacting fermionic systems illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, showing precise agreement with trajectory methods while providing significantly better statistical convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an introduction to quantum computing (QC) tailored for computing professionals such as programmers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists. Our approach abstracts away the physics underlying QC, which can be challenging to grasp, and frames it as a model of computation similar to, for instance, Turing machines. This helps readers grasp the fundamental principles of QC from a purely logical perspective. We begin by defining quantum states and qubits, establishing their mathematical representation and role in computation. We introduce fundamental concepts such as basis states, quantum gates, and tensor products, illustrating how these form the building blocks of quantum computation. Then we present the Deutsch-Josza algorithm, one of the simplest quantum algorithms that demonstrate how quantum computers can outperform classical computers. Finally, we provide guidance for further study, recommending resources for those interested in exploring quantum algorithms, implementations, and industry applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Categorical Compositional Distributional (DisCoCat) framework models meaning in natural language using the mathematical framework of quantum theory, expressed as formal diagrams. DisCoCat diagrams can be associated with tensor networks and quantum circuits. DisCoCat diagrams have been connected to density matrices in various contexts in Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). Previous use of density matrices in QNLP entails modelling ambiguous words as probability distributions over more basic words (the word \texttt{queen}, e.g., might mean the reigning queen or the chess piece). In this article, we investigate using probability distributions over processes to account for syntactic ambiguity in sentences. The meanings of these sentences are represented by density matrices. We show how to create probability distributions on quantum circuits that represent the meanings of sentences and explain how this approach generalises tasks from the literature. We conduct an experiment to validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Information Across the Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of black holes on entanglement harvesting has been of considerable interest over the past decade. Research involving stationary Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors near a (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has uncovered phenomena such as entanglement shadows, entanglement amplification through black hole rotation, and differences between bipartite and tripartite entanglement. For a (1+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, it has been shown that two infalling UDW detectors can harvest entanglement from the scalar quantum vacuum even when separated by an event horizon. In this paper, we calculate the mutual information between two UDW detectors coupled to a massless quantum scalar field, with the detectors starting at rest and falling radially into a non-rotating (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. The trajectory of the detectors includes regions where both detectors are switched on outside of the horizon; where one detector is switched on inside of the horizon while the other switches on outside; and where both detectors switch on inside of the horizon. We investigate different black hole masses, detector energy gaps, widths and temporal separations of the detector switching functions, and field boundary conditions. We find that black holes--even the simplest kind having constant curvature--significantly affect the correlation properties of quantum fields in the vacuum state. These correlations, both outside and inside the horizon, can be mapped out by infalling detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information meets High-Energy Physics: Input to the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown, and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding, by about 12 orders of magnitude, the laboratory setups typically used in the field. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research, and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>On Infinite Tensor Networks, Complementary Recovery and Type II Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of local operator algebras at the boundary of infinite tensor networks, using the mathematical theory of inductive limits. In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Fermions in $(1+2)$-dimensions modified by nonminimal coupling and its applications to condensed matter physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermions in two-dimensional space, commonly called $(1+2)$-dimensional fermions, exhibit intriguing and distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from their higher-dimensional counterparts. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical examination of planar fermionic systems, presenting novel findings by incorporating nonminimal coupling. Our analysis includes the computation of the non-relativistic limit up to second-order corrections in the Dirac equation. We also explore the Schr\"odinger equation under the influence of a harmonic potential and an electric field. Furthermore, we investigate how the coupling parameter affects physical properties relevant to condensed matter systems. Our results demonstrate that this parameter significantly impacts electronic properties and Hall conductivity. The interplay between an external electric field and the coupling parameter also influences energy levels and the system's polarizability. These findings underscore the novel effects of including nonminimal coupling in wave equations, offering new insights into the physics of coupled systems.</description>

      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic exchange, anisotropy and skyrmionic textures in two-dimensional FeXZ$_{2}$ (\textit{X} = Nb, Ta and \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te) ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeNbTe$_{2}$, long known as a van der Waals metallic system, has recently been resynthesized and shown to exhibit ferromagnetic order. In this study, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we aim to provide a deeper insight into the magnetic properties of FeNbTe$_{2}$ and its related compounds (FeXZ$_{2}$, \textit{X} = Nb, Ta; \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te), in their two-dimensional form, including their non-centrosymmetric Janus counterparts. Our results indicate that these materials are energetically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, supporting the possibility of FeNbTe$_{2}$ exfoliation and potential for experimental realization of new compounds. An evolutionary structure search suggests that FeNbTe$_{2}$ retains its monoclinic symmetry in the monolayer form. Our analysis of hopping parameters obtained from Wannierization of DFT bands shows that the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions are primarily direct, while second-nearest and more distant interactions are mediated by the chalcogen atoms. Interestingly, although the second-nearest-neighbor interactions are smaller in magnitude, they appear to play a key role in determining the magnetic ordering in these systems. We also find evidence of canted magnetic anisotropy in FeXZ$_{2}$ compounds, with relatively strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and easy-axis deviations of up to 41$^\circ$ from the out-of-plane direction-an uncommon and potentially useful feature for spintronic applications. Curie temperatures estimated from Monte Carlo simulations are below room temperature but above cryogenic levels for most compounds. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that Janus-structured FeNbSeTe can host N\'eel-type skyrmions even in the absence of an external magnetic field, making this compound a suitable candidate for further experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Bose ladder with extended range density-density interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When hard-core bosons on a two-leg ladder get frustrated by ring exchange interactions, the elusive d-wave Bose liquid (DBL) can be stabilized, a bosonic analog of a correlated metal. Here, we analyze the effect of extended Hubbard interactions on the DBL phase. Strikingly, these interactions are found to act in favor of the exotic Bose liquid. This observation is of immediate relevance for physical systems in which non-local exchange processes occur as a consequence of extended-range density-density interactions. Our observation also helps to achieve DBL physics in a synthetic-dimension ladder, where on-site interactions translate into non-local interactions along a synthetic rung. In this context, we also consider the extreme limit, in which the local hardcore constraint is elevated to an effective rung blockade. In addition to the enhancement of DBL physics due to extended-range density-density interactions, we also find signatures of an interesting intermediate phase between the superfluid and the DBL regime. This phase, labeled as the density modulated s-wave paired (DMSP) phase, combines features of density wave and s-wave pairing. Our results offer new insights into the physics of frustrated bosons by highlighting the influence of density-density interaction and rung-blockade.</description>

      <title>Making the quantum world accessible to young learners through Quantum Picturalism: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The educational value of a fully diagrammatic approach in a scientific field has never been explored. We present Quantum Picturalism (QPic), an entirely diagrammatic formalism for all of qubit quantum mechanics. This framework is particularly advantageous for young learners as a novel way to teach key concepts such as entanglement, measurement, and mixed-state quantum mechanics in a math-intensive subject. This eliminates traditional obstacles without compromising mathematical correctness - removing the need for matrices, vectors, tensors, complex numbers, and trigonometry as prerequisites to learning. Its significance lies in that a field as complex as Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), for which educational opportunities are typically exclusive to the university level and higher, can be introduced at high school level. In this study, we tested this hypothesis, examining whether QPic reduces cognitive load by lowering complex mathematical barriers while enhancing mental computation and conceptual understanding. The data was collected from an experiment conducted in 2023, whereby 54 high school students (aged 16-18) underwent 16 hours of training spread over eight weeks. The post-assessments illustrated promising outcomes in all three specific areas of focus: (1) whether QPic can alleviate technical barriers in learning QIST, (2) ensures that the content and teaching method are age appropriate, (3) increases confidence and motivation in science and STEM fields. There was a notable success rate in terms of teaching outcomes, with 82% of participants successfully passing an end-of-training exam and 48% achieving a distinction, indicating a high level of performance. The unique testing and training regime effectively reduced the technical barriers typically associated with traditional approaches, as hypothesized.</description>

Abstract: In quantum computing, characterizing the full noise profile of qubits can aid in increasing coherence times and fidelities by developing error-mitigating techniques specific to the noise present. This characterization also supports efforts in advancing device fabrication to remove sources of noise. Qubit properties can be subject to non-trivial correlations in space and time, for example, spin qubits in MOS quantum dots are exposed to noise originating from the complex glassy behavior of two-level fluctuator ensembles. Engineering progress in spin qubit experiments generates large amounts of data, necessitating analysis techniques from fields experienced in managing large data sets. Fields such as astrophysics, finance, and climate science use wavelet-based methods to enhance their data analysis. Here, we propose and demonstrate wavelet-based analysis techniques to decompose signals into frequency and time components, enhancing our understanding of noise sources in qubit systems by identifying features at specific times. We apply the analysis to a state-of-the-art two-qubit experiment in a pair of SiMOS quantum dots with feedback applied to relevant operation variables. The observed correlations serve to identify common microscopic causes of noise, such as two-level fluctuators and hyperfine coupled nuclei, as well as to elucidate pathways for multi-qubit operation with more scalable feedback systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing has demonstrated how quantum Zeno can be used to construct quantum optimisers. However, much less work has been done to understand how more general Zeno effects could be used in a similar setting. We use a construction based on three state systems rather than directly in qubits, so that a qubit can remain after projecting out one of the states. We find that our model of computing is able to recover the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model, several generalisations are possible, but our methods allow for constraints to be implemented non-perturbatively and does not need tunable couplers, unlike simple transverse field implementations. We further discuss how to implement the protocol physically using methods building on STIRAP protocols for state transfer. We find a substantial challenge, that settings defined exclusively by measurement or dissipative Zeno effects do not allow for frustration, and in these settings pathological spectral features arise leading to unfavorable runtime scaling. We discuss methods to overcome this challenge for example including gain as well as loss as is often done in an optical setting.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad range of applications, from quantum chemistry to semiconductor design. In this work, we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by transforming their eigenvalues while keeping their eigenstates unchanged. We develop a universal algorithm that deterministically implements any desired (suitably differentiable) function on the eigenvalues of any unknown Hamiltonian, whose positive-time and negative-time dynamics are given as a black box. Our algorithm uses correlated randomness to efficiently combine two subroutines -- namely controlization and Fourier series simulation -- exemplifying a general compilation procedure that we develop. The time complexity of our algorithm is significantly reduced via said compilation technique compared to a na{\"i}ve concatenation of the subroutines and outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular value transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a phenomenon whereby multiple copies of biseparable but fully inseparable states can exhibit GME. This was shown to be generically possible in finite dimensions. Here, we extend this analysis to infinite dimensions. We provide examples of GME-activatable non-Gaussian states. For Gaussian states, we apply a necessary biseparability criterion for the covariance matrix and show that it cannot detect GME activation. We further identify fully inseparable Gaussian states that satisfy the criterion but show that multiple and, in some cases, even single copies are GME. Thus, we show that the covariance-matrix biseparability criterion is not sufficient even for Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process's complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state's complexity entropy. The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the complexity relative entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer's ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy and determine the complexity entropy's behavior under random circuits. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a complexity conditional entropy, which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee. Overall, our framework extends the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics to integrate a notion of time, as quantified by complexity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Reduce Derivative Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of an alternative approach, named Quantum Non-Demolition Measurement (QNDM), to efficiently estimate the gradients or the Hessians of a quantum observable. This is a key step and a resource-demanding task when we want to minimize the cost function associated with a quantum observable. In our detailed analysis, we account for all the resources needed to implement the QNDM approach with a fixed accuracy and compare them to the current state-of-the-art method. We find that the QNDM approach is more efficient, i.e. it needs fewer resources, in evaluating the derivatives of a cost function. These advantages are already clear in small dimensional systems and are likely to increase for practical implementations and more realistic situations. A significant outcome of our study is the implementation of the QNDM method in Python, provided in the supplementary material. Given that most Variational Quantum Algorithms can be formulated within this framework, our results can have significant implications in quantum optimization algorithms and make the QNDM approach a valuable alternative to implement Variational Quantum Algorithms on near-term quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Characterising the performance of noisy quantum circuits is central to the production of prototype quantum computers and can enable improved quantum error correction that exploits noise biases identified in a quantum device. We develop a scalable noise characterisation protocol suited to characterising the syndrome extraction circuits of quantum error correcting codes, a key component of fault-tolerant architectures. Our protocol builds upon averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a framework for noise characterisation experiments that simultaneously estimates the Pauli error probabilities of all gates in a Clifford circuit and captures averaged spatial correlations between gates implemented simultaneously in the layers of the circuit. By rigorously analysing the performance of noise characterisation experiments in the ACES framework, we derive a figure of merit for their expected performance, allowing us to optimise their experimental design and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental resources. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our protocol through circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise characterisation procedure for the syndrome extraction circuit of a distance-25 surface code with over 1000 qubits. Our results indicate that detailed noise characterisation methods are scalable to near-term quantum devices. We release our code in the form of the Julia package QuantumACES.</description>

      <title>On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains: exact analytics, distributions and tight approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We generalize this approach as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times -- allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate, both with and without binning methods.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of Open Quantum Systems via Hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. This framework yields mixing time estimates for a class of quantum systems that are otherwise hard to analyze, even though it does not apply to arbitrary Lindbladians. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Repeater-Based Quantum Communication Protocol: Maximizing Teleportation Fidelity with Minimal Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmitting unknown quantum states to distant locations is crucial for distributed quantum information protocols. The seminal quantum teleportation scheme achieves this feat while requiring prior maximal entanglement between the sender and receiver. In scenarios with noisy entangled states, optimal teleportation fidelity characterizes the efficacy of transmitting the state, demanding the proper selection of local operations at the sender's and receiver's ends. The complexity escalates further in long-range communication setups, prompting the consideration of a repeater-based approach, which incorporates arrays of nodes with multiple segments to facilitate the efficient transmission of quantum information. The fidelity of the communication line gets degraded even if a single segment is affected by noise. In such cases, the general wisdom employs the standard entanglement swapping protocol involving maximally entangled states across the noiseless segments and applying maximally entangled basis measurement at the corresponding nodes to achieve optimal fidelity. In this Letter, we propose a more efficient protocol for a certain class of noisy states in any intermediary segment, achieving the same fidelity as the standard protocol while consuming less amount of entanglement. Our approach ensures enhanced teleportation fidelity even when the end-to-end state gets noisier, and thus promises efficient utility of quantum resources in repeater-based distributed quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory based on concatenating surface codes and quantum Hamming codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing quantum error correcting codes that promise a high error threshold, low resource overhead and efficient decoding algorithms is crucial to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. The concatenated quantum Hamming code is one of the potential candidates that allows for constant space overhead and efficient decoding. We study the concatenation of surface codes with quantum Hamming codes as a quantum memory, and estimate its error threshold, resource overhead and decoding time. A high error threshold is achieved, which can in principle be pushed up to the threshold of the surface code. Furthermore, the concatenated codes can suppress logical errors to a much lower level than the surface codes, under the assumption of comparable amount of resource overhead. The advantage in suppressing errors starts to show for a quantum memory of intermediate scale. Concatenating surface codes with quantum Hamming codes therefore provides a promising avenue to demonstrate small-scale fault-tolerant quantum circuits in the near future, and also paves a way for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Attainability of quantum state discrimination bounds with collective measurements on finite copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics is that non-orthogonal states cannot be distinguished perfectly. When distinguishing multiple copies of a mixed quantum state, a collective measurement, which generates entanglement between the different copies of the unknown state, can achieve a lower error probability than non-entangling measurements. The error probability that can be attained using a collective measurement on a finite number of copies of the unknown state is given by the Helstrom bound. In the limit where we can perform a collective measurement on asymptotically many copies of the quantum state, the quantum Chernoff bound gives the attainable error probability. It is natural to ask at what rate does the error tend to this asymptotic limit, and whether the asymptotic limit can be attained for any finite number of copies. In this paper we address these questions. We find analytic expressions for the Helstrom bound for arbitrarily many copies of the unknown state in several simple qubit examples. Using these analytic expressions, we investigate how the attainable error rate changes as we allow collective measurements on finite numbers of copies of the quantum state. We also investigate the necessary conditions to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound. It is known that a collective measurement on all M-copies of the unknown state is always sufficient to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound. However, general conditions for when such a measurement is necessary to saturate the Helstrom bound remain unknown. We investigate specific measurement strategies which involve entangling operations on fewer than all M-copies of the unknown state. For many regimes we find that a collective measurement on all M-copies of the unknown state is necessary to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound.</description>

      <title>Super-Heisenberg scaling in a triple point criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced metrology in a triple point criticality and discover that quantum criticality can not always enhance measuring precision. We have developed suitable adiabatic evolution protocols approaching a final point around the triple point to effectively restrain excitations, which could accelerate the adiabatic evolutions and lead to an exponential super-Heisenberg scaling. This scaling behavior is quite valuable in practical parameter estimating experiments with limited coherence time. The super-Heisenberg scaling will degrade into a sub-Heisenberg scaling if the adiabatic parameter modulations adopted can not reduce excitations and weaken the slowing down effect. Additionally, a feasible experimental scheme is also suggested to achieve the anticipated exponential super-Heisenberg scaling. Our findings strongly indicate that criticality-enhanced metrology can indeed significantly enhance measuring precision to a super-Heisenberg scaling when combining a triple point and beneficial parameter modulations in the adiabatic evolution, which will be conducive to the exploration of other super-Heisenberg scaling and their applications.</description>

      <title>Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yes, we show that they are.
  We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by $k$ separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial $k$. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly.</description>

      <title>Learning the closest product state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a (pure) product state with optimal fidelity to an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, given copies of $\rho$. This is a basic instance of a fundamental question in quantum learning: is it possible to efficiently learn a simple approximation to an arbitrary state? We give an algorithm which finds a product state with fidelity $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, using $N = n^{\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ copies of $\rho$ and $\text{poly}(N)$ classical overhead. We further show that estimating the optimal fidelity is NP-hard for error $\varepsilon = 1/\text{poly}(n)$, showing that the error dependence cannot be significantly improved.
  For our algorithm, we build a carefully-defined cover over candidate product states, qubit by qubit, and then demonstrate that extending the cover can be reduced to approximate constrained polynomial optimization. For our proof of hardness, we give a formal reduction from polynomial optimization to finding the closest product state. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two seemingly unrelated questions. Building on our general approach, we also develop more efficient algorithms in three simpler settings: when the optimal fidelity exceeds $5/6$; when we restrict ourselves to a discrete class of product states; and when we are allowed to output a matrix product state.</description>

Abstract: Correlations play a pivotal role in various fields of science, particularly in quantum mechanics, yet their proper quantification remains a subject of debate. In this work, we aim to discuss the challenge of defining a reliable measure of total correlations. We first outline essential properties that an effective correlation measure should satisfy and review existing measures, including quantum mutual information, the p-norm of the correlation matrix, and the recently defined quantum Pearson correlation coefficient. Additionally, we introduce new measures based on R\'enyi and Tsallis relative entropies, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our analysis reveals that while quantum mutual information, the p-norm, and the Pearson measure exhibit equivalence for two-qubit systems, they all suffer from an ordering problem. Despite criticisms regarding its reliability, we argue that quantum mutual information remains a valid measure of total correlations.</description>

Abstract: Let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be the Hilbert space dimensions of two subsystems of a quantum system of total Hilbert space dimension $D=D_1D_2$. In the thermodynamic limit (with $1\ll D_1 \ll D_2$), we know from the works of Page and Sen that the average von Neumann (VN) entropy of the first subsystem is $\mathbb{E}({S}^{sb}_{VN})=\ln(D_1)+O(D_1/D_2)$ if the full system is in a random pure state. Here, it is argued that this result can be strengthened for a thermalized quantum system. Consider the subspace $\mathcal{H}_E$ of the total Hilbert space corresponding to a narrow shell around the energy $E$. We find that the result of Page and Sen holds for each of these subspaces, that is, the VN entropy, when averaged over the states in $\mathcal{H}_E$, is given by $\overline{S}^{sb}_{VN} \approx \ln \widetilde{d}_1$, where $\widetilde{d}_1$ represents the dimension of the effective Hilbert space of the first subsystem relevant to $\mathcal{H}_E$. If $d_E = \dim{(\mathcal{H}_E)}$, we estimate that $\widetilde{d}_1 = D_1^\gamma$, where $\gamma = \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$. This finding has significant implications, as it suggests an equivalence between the VN entropy and the thermodynamic (TH) entropy of a subsystem within a much larger thermalized quantum system. For completeness, we also discuss in this work the issue of equivalence between the VN entropy and TH entropy for isolated system (as a whole) and open system. For numerical demonstration of our important results, we here consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain with next-nearest neighbor interactions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Time Quantum Gibbs Sampling for Fermi-Hubbard Model at any Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there have been several advancements in quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling. These algorithms simulate the dynamics generated by an artificial Lindbladian, which is meticulously constructed to obey a detailed-balance condition with the Gibbs state of interest, ensuring it is a stationary point of the evolution, while simultaneously having efficiently implementable time steps. The overall complexity then depends primarily on the mixing time of the Lindbladian, which can vary drastically, but which has been previously bounded in the regime of high enough temperatures [Rouz\'e et al. arXiv:2403.12691 and arXiv:2411.04885]. In this work, we calculate the spectral gap of the Lindbladian for free fermions using third quantisation, and also prove a logarithmic bound on its mixing time by analysing corresponding covariance matrices. Then we prove a constant gap of the perturbed Lindbladian corresponding to interacting fermions up to some maximal coupling strength. This is achieved by using theorems about stability of the gap for lattice fermions. Our methods apply at any constant temperature and independently of the system size. The gap then provides an upper bound on the mixing time, and hence on the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm, proving that the purified Gibbs state of weakly interacting (quasi-)local fermionic systems of any dimension can be prepared in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (n^3 \operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ time on $\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, where $n$ denotes the size of the system and $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. As an application, we explain how to calculate partition functions for the considered systems. We provide exact numerical simulations for small system sizes supporting the theory and also identify different suitable jump operators and filter functions for the sought-after regime of intermediate coupling in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics implies that if a system is in a discrete eigenstate of a Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian evolves in time arbitrarily slowly, the system will remain in the corresponding eigenstate of the evolved Hamiltonian. Understanding corrections to the adiabatic result that arise when the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow -- but not arbitrarily slow -- has become increasingly important, especially since adiabatic evolution has been proposed as a method of state preparation in quantum computing. This paper identifies two regimes, an adiabatic regime in which corrections are generically small and can depend on details of the evolution throughout the path, and a hyperadiabatic regime in which the error is given by a form similar to an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the evolution time with the coefficients depending principally on the behavior at the endpoints. However, the error in this hyperadiabatic regime is neither given by a true asymptotic series nor solely dependent on the endpoints: the coefficients combine the contributions from both endpoints, with relative phase factors that depend on the average spectral gaps along the trajectory, multiplied by the evolution time. The central result of this paper is to identify a quantity, referred to as the typical error, which is obtained by appropriately averaging the error over evolution times that are small compared to the evolution time itself. This typical error is characterized by an asymptotic series and depends solely on the endpoints of the evolution, remaining independent of the details of the intermediate evolution.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with deep connections to entanglement, magic, and uncertainty relations. Entanglement, for instance, has driven key advances like surface codes and has deepened our understanding of quantum gravity through holographic quantum codes. While these connections are well-explored, the role of contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. Notably, Bell nonlocality is a special case of contextuality, and prior works have established contextuality as a key resource for quantum computational advantage.
  In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. Using a sheaf-theoretic framework, we define contextuality for such codes and prove key results on its manifestation. Specifically, we prove the equivalence of definitions of contextuality from Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic framework and Kirby--Love's tree-based approach for the partial closure of Pauli measurement sets. We present several findings, including the proof of a recent conjecture posed by Kim and Abramsky. Working within the partial closure, we further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. As a consequence, we highlight that several protocols for code-switching between stabilizer codes, which admit a universal transversal gate set, are strongly contextual. Our findings reveal a direct connection between contextuality and quantum error correction, offering new insights into the nonclassical resources enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Measurement Scheme for Generating nonGaussian Spin States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for generating nonclassical states of atomic spin ensembles through the backaction induced by a hybrid measurement of light that is entangled with atoms, combining both homodyne and single photon detection. In phase-I of the protocol we create a spin squeezed state by measuring the light's polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect in a balanced polarimeter, equivalent to a homodyne measurement. In phase-II we send a second probe beam through the sample and detect single photons scattered into the signal mode. Before doing so, we rotate the uncertainty bubble to increase the projection fluctuations of the measured spin component. This increases the coupling strength between the atoms and photons and thus the rate of scattering of single photons into the signal mode. In the ideal case, the result is a squeezed Dicke state, with substantial quantum advantage for sensing spin rotations. We benchmark the protocol's utility in the presence of inevitable decoherence due to optical pumping using the Fisher information as a measure of quantum advantage. We show that in the presence of decoherence, the quantum Fisher information associated with the nonGaussian mixed state we prepare is substantially larger than the classical Fisher information obtained from the standard measurement of spin rotations. We deduce a measurement basis that is close to optimal for achieving the quantum Cram\'{e}r Rao bound in the presence of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Improving error suppression with noise-aware decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the performance of quantum error correction can be improved with noise-aware decoders that are calibrated to the likelihood of physical error configurations in a device. We show that noise-aware decoding increases the error suppression factor of the surface code, yielding reductions in the logical error rate that increase exponentially with the code distance. Our calibration protocol involves circuit-level Pauli noise characterisation experiments with averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling. This enables decoder calibration at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation and near-optimal decoding when compared to the true noise model. Our results indicate that these noise characterisation experiments could be performed and processed in seconds for superconducting quantum computers. This establishes the practicality and utility of noise-aware decoding for quantum error correction at scale.</description>

      <title>Classical and mixed classical-quantum systems from van Hove's unitary representation of contact transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Descriptions of classical mechanics in Hilbert space go back to the work of Koopman and von Neumann in the 1930s. Decades later, van Hove derived a unitary representation of the group of contact transformations which recently has been used to develop a novel formulation of classical mechanics in Hilbert space. This formulation differs from the Koopman-von Neumann theory in many ways. Classical observables are represented by van Hove operators, which satisfy a commutation algebra isomorphic to the Poisson algebra of functions in phase space. Moreover, these operators are both observables and generators of transformations, which makes it unnecessary to introduce unobservable auxiliary operators as in the Koopman-von Neumann theory. In addition, for consistency with classical mechanics, a constraint must be imposed that fixes the phase of the wavefunction. The approach can be extended to hybrid mixed classical-quantum systems in Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the measurement of a quantum two-level system (qubit) by a classical apparatus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</description>

Abstract: Based on the physical interpretation of the photon continuity equation derived in [M. Hawton, Phys. Rev. A 109, 062221 (2024) ] the standard Lagrangian is second quantized to obtain a Lorentz and gauge invariant theory of single photons. The scalar potential is not independently second quantized so all modes have positive definite norm. The continuity equation is generalized by separating the material source current into a nonabsorbing term describing propagation in a lossless transmission line and localizable single photon emission and detection terms that do not require nonlocal separation of transverse and longitudinal modes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.</description>

Abstract: The symmetric subspace of multi-qubit systems, that is, the space of states invariant under permutations, is commonly encountered in applications in the context of quantum information and communication theory. It is known that the symmetric subspace can be described in terms of irreducible representations of the group $SU(2)$, whose representation spaces form a basis of symmetric states, the so-called Dicke states. In this work, we present deformations of the symmetric subspace as deformations of this group structure, which are promoted to a quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$. We see that deformations of the symmetric subspace obtained in this manner correspond to local deformations of the inner product of each spin, in such a way that departure from symmetry can be encoded in a position-dependent inner product. The consequences and possible extensions of these results are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum process characterization is a fundamental task in quantum information processing, yet conventional methods, such as quantum process tomography, require prohibitive resources and lack scalability. Here, we introduce an efficient quantum process learning method specifically designed for short-time Hamiltonian dynamics. Our approach reconstructs an equivalent quantum circuit representation from measurement data of unknown Hamiltonian evolution without requiring additional assumptions and achieves polynomial sample and computational efficiency. Our results have broad applications in various directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking realistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable quantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrating a Black Hole with Inhomogeneous Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum quench processes in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in which the initial thermal equilibrium (Gibbs) state is time-evolved by spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, the so-called M\"obius and sine-square-deformed (SSD) Hamiltonians. We found that, when the quench is induced by the SSD Hamiltonian, almost all the degrees of freedom are asymptotically gathered at a single point, resulting in a point-like excitation. This excitation, which we dub black hole-like excitation, carries as much information as the total thermal entropy. In contrast, other parts of the system approach the low-entropy (low-temperature) state at late times. For the quench by the M\"obius Hamiltonian, we instead found an eternal periodic oscillation of physical quantities such as von Neumann entropy for subsystems. When the CFT admits a holographic dual description, the SSD quench induces a time-dependent, inhomogeneous deformation of the bulk black hole horizon, which, at late enough times, ``touches'' the boundary. Our quench setups can be used as a way to create low-temperature states, and, also, simulate the formation and evaporation processes of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>n-dimensional non-commutative GUP quantization and application to the Bianchi I model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a n-dimensional Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) quantization framework, characterized by a non-commutative nature of the configurational variables. First, we identify a set of states which are maximally localized only along a single direction, at the expense of being less localized in all the other ones. Subsequently, in order to recover information about localization on the whole configuration space, we use the only state of the theory which exhibits maximal localization simultaneously in every direction to construct a satisfactory quasi-position representation, by virtue of a suitable translational operator. The resultant quantum framework is then applied to model the dynamics of the Bianchi I cosmology. The corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation is reduced to Schr\"odinger dynamics for the two anisotropy degrees of freedom, using a WKB representation for the volume-like variable of the Universe, in accordance with the Vilenkin scenario. The main result of our cosmological implementation of the constructed quantum theory demonstrates how the dynamics of a wave packet peaked at some point in the configuration space represented in the quasi-position variables, favours as the most probable configuration exactly the initial one for a relatively long time, if compared with the ordinary quantum theory. This preference arises from the distinct behavioral dynamics exhibited by wave packets in the two quantum theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive-Operator-Valued-Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, 0 = 0, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers and for arbitrary global physical states), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the `observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of charge and spin conductance as well as charge and spin quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise as probes to analyze and contrast Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR bound states, induced by magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within the superconducting gap, are distinct from MBS, which can also arise in systems with magnetic impurities, such as magnetic adatoms on superconductors, often leading to false positives in MBS detection. Replacing a trivial $s$-wave superconductor with a topological superconductor featuring triplet pairing, e.g., chiral-$p$ or spinless $p$-wave superconducting nanowire, we analyze and establish clear distinctions between YSR states and MBS. This work provides an unique signature for YSR states, demonstrating that charge or spin conductance as well as both charge and spin quantum noise, along their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts are effective in identifying YSR bound states and distinguishing them from MBS.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of Timelike Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuations of holographic entanglement entropy in which the boundary subregion extends along a timelike direction have brought a promise of a novel, time-centric probe of the emergence of spacetime. We propose that the bulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are boundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of holographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only provides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct analytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement entropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study holographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the investigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the boundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal surfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical contribution.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical analytical approach to universal spectral correlations in Brownian Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlators in zero-dimensional Brownian models of quantum chaos. The approach expresses these spectral correlations as part of a closed hierarchy of differential equations that can be formulated for all system sizes and in each of the three standard symmetry classes (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic, as determined by the presence and nature of time-reversal symmetry). The hierarchy applies exactly, and in the same form, to Dyson's Brownian motion and all systems with stochastically emerging basis invariance, where the model-dependent information is subsumed in a single dynamical time scale whose explicit form we also establish. We further verify this universality numerically for the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of the symmetry class determined by the number of fermions. This results in a complete analytical description of the spectral correlations and allows us to identify which correlations are universal in a large class of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.</description>

      <title>Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is central to information theory and motivates the study of monotonic divergences. However, it is not clear operationally we need to consider all such divergences. We establish a simple method for Pinsker inequalities as well as general bounds in terms of $\chi^{2}$-divergences for twice-differentiable $f$-divergences. These tools imply new relations for input-dependent contraction coefficients. We use these relations to show for many $f$-divergences the rate of contraction of a time homogeneous Markov chain is characterized by the input-dependent contraction coefficient of the $\chi^{2}$-divergence. This is efficient to compute and the fastest it could converge for a class of divergences. We show similar ideas hold for mixing times. Moreover, we extend these results to the Petz $f$-divergences in quantum information theory, albeit without any guarantee of efficient computation. These tools may have applications in other settings where iterative data processing is relevant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>
