      <title>Tensionless String Limits in 4d Conformal Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on insights from the Swampland program, we initiate a classification of infinite distance limits in the conformal manifolds of 4d SCFTs. Each limit is characterized by a Hagedorn-like behavior of the large $N$ density of states, which we argue holographically correspond to different tensionless string limits. We focus on 4d large $N$ SCFTs with simple gauge groups, which exhibit an overall free limit at infinite distance within the conformal manifold. In this class of theories, only three types of weak-coupling limits arise. They are distinguished by the exponential rate $\alpha$ of the anomalous dimension of the higher-spin tower, which we find to be determined by the ratio of the central charges $a/c$. We compute the large $N$ partition function at the free point for all these SCFTs, and derive a universal expression for the Hagedorn temperature as a function of $\alpha$ (or, equivalently, of $a/c$), regardless of the gauge group or matter content. This Hagedorn-like density of states suggests that these weak-coupling limits correspond holographically to the tensionless limits of three different strings: the critical Type IIB string and two non-critical strings that arise exclusively in non-Einstein gravitational theories. Our findings are consistent with the Emergent String Conjecture when applied to theories with Einstein gravity at low energies. We also use our results to present a new argument for the absence of scale separation in the holographic AdS bulk dual of these 4d SCFTs. This argument is based on the existence of a bona fide 't Hooft limit, or equivalently, on satisfying the sharpened lower bound for the Distance Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Replica analysis of entanglement properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a systematic analysis of the properties of entanglement entropy in curved backgrounds using the replica approach. We explore the analytic $(q-1)$ expansion of R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ and its variations; our setup applies to generic variations, from symmetry transformations to variations of the background metric or entangling region. Our methodology elegantly reproduces and generalises results from the literature on entanglement entropy in different dimensions, backgrounds, and states. We use our analytic expansions to explore the behaviour of entanglement entropy in static black hole backgrounds under specific scaling transformations, and we explain why this behaviour is key to determining whether there are islands of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Frozen Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-theory frozen singularities are (locally) $D$- or $E$-type orbifold singularities with a background fractional $C_3$-monodromy surrounding them. In this paper, we revisit such backgrounds and address several puzzling features of their physics. We first give a top-down derivation of how the $D$- or $E$-type 7D $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory directly ``freezes" to a lower rank gauge theory due to the $C_3$-background. This relies on a Hanany--Witten effect of fractional M5 branes and the presence of a gauge anomaly of fractional D$p$ probes in the circle reduction. Additionally, we compute defect groups and 8D symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) of the 7D frozen theories in several duality frames. We apply our results to understanding the evenness condition of strings ending on $O7^+$-planes, and calculating the global forms of supergravity gauge groups of M-theory compactified on $T^4/\Gamma$ with frozen singularities. In an Appendix, we also revisit IIA $ADE$ singularities with a $C_1$-monodromy along a 1-cycle in the boundary lens space and show that this freezes the gauge degrees-of-freedom via confinement.</description>

      <title>End of the World Boundaries for Chiral Quantum Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the construction of large classes of explicit string theory backgrounds corresponding to 6d and 4d chiral theories with end of the world boundaries, and describe the strong coupling phenomena involved in gapping the chiral (but non-anomalous) sets of fields, such as strongly coupled phase transitions or symmetric mass generation. One class of 6d constructions is closely related to chirality changing phase transitions, such as those turning heterotic NS5-branes into gauge instantons, in flat space or orbifold singularities. A class of 4d models exploits systems of IIB D3-branes at toric CY3 singularities with an extra $\mathbf{Z}_2$ involution related to $G_2$ holonomy manifolds in the mirror type IIA picture, which we explicitly describe in terms of dimer diagrams.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries from extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Kaluza-Klein compactifications, some symmetries of the higher dimensional theory are preserved in lower dimensions, others are broken, and occasionally, there are symmetry enhancements. The symmetries that are enhanced by toroidal compactifications were recently shown to define a symmetry principle with constrained parameters that fixes the action before dimensional reduction. Here we show the opposite: symmetries of the higher dimensional theory that are broken in the reduction process, can actually be realized after dimensional reduction as a global symmetry principle with constrained parameters that fixes couplings in the lower dimensional theory. We implement this principle in pure gravity, half-maximal supergravity and the circle reduction of 11 dimensional supergravity to Type IIA superstring theory. As a further application, we show that it can be used to constrain the quartic Ramond-Ramond couplings in Type IIA superstring theory from the four-point $\zeta(3)\, \alpha'{}^3\, t_8 t_8 R^{(-) 4}$ interactions.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the matrix integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a duality between the complex Liouville string and a two-matrix integral. The complex Liouville string is defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex central charges $c = 13 \pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. The matrix integral is characterized by its spectral curve which allows us to compute the perturbative string amplitudes recursively via topological recursion. This duality constitutes a controllable instance of holographic duality. The leverage on the theory is provided by the rich analytic structure of the string amplitudes that we discussed in arXiv:2409.18759 and allows us to perform numerous tests on the duality.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from the Hagedorn Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational wave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy density is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom - a Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach to string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits analytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the out-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude that, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source gravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare the results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave background of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is significantly larger. This is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over the field theory analogue. This work is based on arXiv:2310.11494 and arXiv:2408.13803 and is a contribution to the Proceedings of the 29th symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 2024).</description>

      <title>Renormalons as Saddle Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantons and renormalons play important roles at the interface between perturbative and non-perturbative quantum field theory. They are both associated with branch points in the Borel transform of asymptotic series, and as such can be detected in perturbation theory. However, while instantons are associated with non-perturbative saddle points of the path integral, renormalons have mostly been understood in terms of Feynman diagrams and the operator product expansion. We provide a non-perturbative path integral explanation of how both instantons and renormalons produce singularities in the Borel plane using representative finite-dimensional integrals. In particular, renormalons can be understood as saddle points of the 1-loop effective action, enabled by a crucial contribution from the quantum scale anomaly. These results enable an exploration of renormalons from the path integral and thereby provide a new way to probe connections between perturbative and non-perturbative physics in QCD and other theories.</description>

      <title>Witten diagrams in momentum space and one graviton exchange between scalars in Weyl invariant unimodular gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle head-on the computation of the $s$-channel Witten diagram in momentum space corresponding to the exchange of a graviton between minimally coupled scalars in Weyl invariant unimodular gravity. By means of a lengthy calculation, we show first that the value of the diagram in question is the same as in General Relativity and, then, we obtain a compact expression for it in terms of the Mandelstam variables.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The spacetime interpolates between Anti de-Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. They are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is enclosed inside their inner event horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the charged black strings. The black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We find that their masses can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the Kalb-Ramond field in the black strings. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS$_6$ black holes from ISO(3)xU(1) F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a maximally supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum with $SO(3)\subset ISO(3)$ symmetry. We find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing topological twists along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$, we perform a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields and find $AdS_2\times \Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ solutions for at least one of the Riemann surface being negatively curved. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Kahler four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$, a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$. Finally, performing a twist by turning on $SO(3)$ gauge fields in the case of $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Cayley four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$ also leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between all of these $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and the asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacuum. All of the solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ leading to a new class of supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4\times S^2\times \Sigma$ solutions.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal Hamiltonians modeling the density of states of the Double-Scaled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the global density of states (DOS) in the Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model, we construct a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian that replicates this DOS. We then tridiagonalize the Hamiltonian to determine the mean Lanczos coefficients within the parameter range. The bulk Lanczos coefficients, especially the Lanczos descent can be analytically expressed as a particular $q$-deformation of the logarithm. Our numerical results are further corroborated by semi-analytical findings, a random matrix potential construction in the bulk, and the analytic results at the edge of the Lanczos spectra using the method of moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry properties of the infinite spin fields in the $\rm{AdS}_4$ space which are involved in the Lagrangian model proposed in arXiv:2403.14446 where the main role is played by the operator constraints. It is shown that the conditions defining the infinite spin states in the $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are the $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$-invariant. It is found that in the model under consideration the Casimir operators are completely fixed by the constraint operators and only one of the Casimir operators is independent. It is shown that in this model, the infinite spin fields in the $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are described by the most degenerate representations of the $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$ group.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action, resummed in derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. We discuss the applicability of our results to the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Poincar\'e superalgebras for which the nested bracket of three supercharges is necessarily zero only in dimensions greater than three. In lower dimensions, we give a precise characterisation of the data which encodes any such Poincar\'e superalgebra in terms of a more elementary embedding superalgebra. Up to isomorphism, we classify every classical embedding superalgebra that defines a Poincar\'e superalgebra. More generally, we show how to construct an embedding superalgebra in dimensions one, two and three from a certain type of triple system whose product structure encodes the nested bracket of three supercharges in the associated Poincar\'e superalgebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal massive supergravity is the supersymmetric extension of minimal massive gravity in three dimensions. The theory admits a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum around which the propagating modes of spin 2 and 3/2 combine into a supermultiplet. In this letter, we determine the most general supersymmetric solution of the theory by analyzing its Killing spinor equations. Just as for topologically massive supergravity, the general supersymmetric solution is a plane wave with a null Killing vector field. As a particular subclass we find null-warped AdS3 spaces and, with proper periodic identifications, null-warped AdS3 black holes.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from a self-interacting scalar field in a Lorentz-violation Horava-Lifshitz model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a massive self-interacting scalar quantum field in a Lorentz-violation scenario based on a Horava-Lifshitz model. Specifically, we investigate the vacuum energy density and its loop correction, up to first order in the self-interaction coupling constant, and also the topological mass generation. These quantities are also analyzed in the case where the field is massless. The scalar vacuum state is perturbed by the presence of two large parallel plates, placed at a distance L from each other, due to the imposition of Dirichlet boundary condition on the two plates. To perform this study, the effective potential approach in quantum field theory is applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative calculations involving fermion loops in quantum field theories require tracing over Dirac matrices. A simple way to regulate the divergences that generically appear in these calculations is dimensional regularisation, which has the consequence of replacing 4-dimensional Dirac matrices with d-dimensional counterparts for arbitrary complex values of d. In this work, a connection between traces of d-dimensional Dirac matrices and computations of the Tutte polynomial of associated graphs is proven. The time complexity of computing Dirac traces is analysed by this connection, and improvements to algorithms for computing Dirac traces are proposed.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces: Fermions with Half-integer Spin, Real Structure, and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the development of a spectral triple-like construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. We have previously shown that key elements of bosonic and fermionic quantum field theory emerge from such a geometrical framework. In this paper we solve a central problem concerning the inclusion of fermions with half-integer spin into this framework. We map the tangent space of the configuration space into a similar space based on spinors and use this map to construct a Dirac operator on the configuration space. We also construct a real structure acting in a Hilbert space over the configuration space. Finally, we show that the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of the Hamiltonian of a non-perturbative quantum Yang-Mills theory emerge from a unitary transformation of a Dirac equation on a configuration space of gauge fields. The dual and anti-dual sectors emerge in a two-by-two matrix structure.</description>

Abstract: The next goalpost in precision calculations for physics beyond the Standard Model is determining the two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We progress towards this goal by determining the RG equations for a simplified version of the SMEFT without any fermion fields. Our calculation relies on functional methods that are newly developed for multi-loop computations and adapted for the determination of RG equations here.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SO(10) Axion Model Without Quality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invisible axion models that solve the strong CP problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified $SO(10)\times U(1)_a$ gauge model, where $U(1)_a$ is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as $4\times 10^{11}$ GeV, allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Cosmic Variance via Remote Quadrupole Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of important cosmological questions can be addressed only by probing perturbation modes on the largest accessible scales. One promising probe of these modes is the Kamionkowski-Loeb effect, i.e., the polarization induced in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by Thomson scattering in galaxy clusters, which is proportional to the CMB quadrupole measured at the cluster's location and look-back time. We develop a Fisher formalism for assessing the amount of new information that can be obtained from a future remote quadrupole survey. To demonstrate the constraining power of such a survey, we apply our formalism to a model that suppresses the primordial power spectrum on large scales but is poorly constrained with existing CMB data. We find that the constraints can be improved by $4\sigma$ for a survey that measures around 100 clusters over $20\%$ of the sky with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0. This constraint improves to over $7\sigma$ for a low-noise survey with dense and full sky coverage. Our formalism, which is based in real space rather than harmonic space, can be used to explore a wide range of survey designs and our results paint an optimistic picture for the utility of remote quadrupole measurements to probe physics on the largest observable scales in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>Formation of defects associated with both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss formation of cosmic strings associated with a spontaneously broken approximate $U(1)$ symmetry by performing classical field-theoretical simulations. An original $U(1)$ symmetry is explicitly broken down to its subgroup $Z_N$ even before spontaneous breaking takes place. We estimate the ratio of explicit breaking to that of spontaneous breaking for which topological defects for $N=1$ and $N=2$ are formed. For $N=1$, a cosmic string attached to a single domain wall can be formed when the amount of the explicit breaking is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking. For $N=2$, no matter how large the explicit breaking is, domain walls are inevitably formed as long as the temperature of the Universe is high enough to restore $Z_2$ symmetry. In that case, cosmic strings are also inevitably formed as long as the amount of the explicit breaking is smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics revisited with general rotation by entropy-current analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical formulation of spin hydrodynamics for Dirac fermions with a general thermal vorticity. The orders of the general thermal vorticity and the corresponding spin variables are considered independently from those of the conventional hydrodynamic variables and their perturbative gradients. Assuming a totally antisymmetric spin current of Dirac fermions, the entropy-current analysis with a general spin potential indicates that the constitutive relations of the stress-energy tensor have to involve spin variables, particularly those linked to boost symmetry, to adhere to the entropy principle. In the presence of the degree of freedom associated with boost symmetry, we choose the constitutive relations of the canonical formulation to be connected to those of the phenomenological formulation through pseudogauge transformation. Subsequently, a linear-mode analysis is conducted using the resulting spin hydrodynamic equations. It is observed that the spin and hydrodynamic modes in this canonical formulation display different characteristics compared to those in the phenomenological formulation up to the second order of gradient.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable inhomogeneous fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 15 exactly solvable inhomogeneous (spinless) fermion systems on one-dimensional lattices are constructed explicitly based on the discrete orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, e.g. the Krawtchouk, Hahn, Racah, Meixner, $q$-Racah polynomials. The Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg equations are solved explicitly, as the entire set of the eigenvalues and eigenstates are known explicitly. The ground state two point correlation functions are derived explicitly. The multi point correlation functions are obtained by Wick's Theorem. Corresponding 15 exactly solvable XX spin systems are also displayed. They all have nearest neighbour interactions. The exact solvability of Schr\"odinger equation means that of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. This leads to 15 exactly solvable Birth and Death fermions and 15 Birth and Death spin models. These provide plenty of materials for calculating interesting quantities, e.g. entanglement entropy, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety (AS) Paradigm is an interesting set of ideas and methods towards a meaningful quantization of Gravity. A brief review of phenomenological consequences in the context of AS regarding cosmology with emphasis on dark energy is given. Furthermore, recent studies that suggest a natural explanation of the recent cosmic acceleration and its coincidence using large-scale structure and AS framework will be analyzed. Finally, the present work extends the analysis of a recent new set of modified Einstein equations inspired from AS program.</description>

Abstract: We determine a full component of the space of stability conditions on $D^b(E^3)$ where $E$ is an elliptic curve without complex multiplication. The component has complex dimension 14 and a very concrete description in terms of alternating trilinear forms. This confirms a conjecture of Kontsevich, motivated by homological mirror symmetry, in the case of dimension $3$.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and global symmetry $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong $\mathcal{S}$ and weak $\mathcal{G}$ symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Renyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs.</description>

Abstract: One of the subtleties that has made superstring perturbation theory intricate at high string loop order is the fact that as shown by Donagi and Witten, supermoduli space is not holomorphically projected, nor is it holomorphically split. In recent years, Sen (further refined by Sen and Witten) has introduced the notion of vertical integration in moduli space. This enables one to build BRST-invariant and well-defined amplitudes by adding certain correction terms to the contributions associated to the traditional "delta function" gauge fixing for the worldsheet gravitino on local patches. The Sen and Witten approach is made possible due to there being no obstruction to a smooth splitting of supermoduli space, but it may not necessarily be the most convenient or natural solution to the problem. In particular, this approach does not determine what these corrections terms actually are from the outset. Instead, it shows that such correction terms in principle exist, and when included make all perturbative amplitudes well-defined. There may be situations however where one would like to instead have a well-defined and fully determined path integral at arbitrary string loop order from the outset. In this paper, I initiate an alternative (differential-geometric) approach that implements the fact that a smooth gauge slice for supermoduli space always exists. As a warmup, I focus specifically on super Riemann surfaces with the topology of a sphere in heterotic string theory, incorporating the corresponding super curvature locally, and introduce a new well-defined smooth gauge fixing that leads to a globally defined path integral measure that translates arbitrary fixed ($-1$) picture NS vertex operators (or handle operators) (that may or may not be offshell) to integrated (0) picture. I also provide some comments on the extension to arbitrary super Riemann surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum improvement of Kerr black holes with mass-dependent scale identifications in asymptotically safe gravity. We find that a physically sensible identification can only be a function of $Mr$ and the area $A=4\pi(r^2+a^2)$ where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $a$ is an angular momentum parameter. We then discuss various properties of the rotating quantum black holes for a simple choice of the identification. We show that the resulting regular rotating black holes have the following nice properties: (i) admitting a consistent black hole thermodynamics at the horizon, (ii) resolving the ring singularity, (iii) partially eliminating closed time-like curves present in the classical Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bound on slow-roll parameter in stringy quintessence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of saxion-axion system in stringy quintessence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The late time behavior of the slow-roll parameter in the stringy quintessence model is studied when axion as well as saxion are allowed to move. Even though the potential is independent of the axion at tree level, the axion can move through its coupling to the saxion and the background geometry. Then the contributions of the axion kinetic energy to the slow-roll parameter and the vacuum energy density are not negligible when the slow-roll approximation does not hold. As the dimension of the field space is doubled, the fixed point at which the time variation of the slow-roll parameter vanishes is not always stable. It is found that the fixed point in the saxion-axion system is at most partially stable, in particular when the volume modulus and the axio-dilaton, the essential ingredients of the string compactification, are taken into account. It seems that as more saxion-axion pairs are considered, achieving the stability of the fixed point becomes difficult.</description>

      <title>Reviving Horndeski after GW170817 by Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural simultaneous modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant. We also argue that the Vainshtein screening that allows to recover GR predictions for solar system tests is also at work for electrodynamics in the dense region of laboratory tests.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at 1-loop in the Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive higher moments in the statistical distribution of OPE coefficients in holographic 2D CFTs, and show that such moments correspond to multiboundary Euclidean wormholes in pure 3D gravity. The n-th cyclic non-Gaussian contraction of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients follows from crossing symmetry of the thermal n-point function. We derive universal expressions for the cubic and quartic moments and demonstrate that their scaling with the microcanonical entropy agrees with a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Motivated by this result, we conjecture that the full statistical ensemble of OPE data is fixed by three premises: typicality, crossing symmetry and modular invariance. Together, these properties give predictions for non-factorizing observables, such as the generalized spectral form factor. Using the Virasoro TQFT, we match these connected averages to new on-shell wormhole topologies with multiple boundary components. Lastly, we study and clarify examples where the statistics of heavy operators are not universal and depend on the light operator spectrum. We give a gravitational interpretation to these corrections in terms of Wilson loops winding around non-trivial cycles in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

By analyzing the effective action of twisted and untwisted moduli, we find that three-form fluxes satisfying the tadpole cancellation conditions lead to supersymmetric AdS vacua. We also investigate swampland conjectures on this non-geometric background.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Gravity from Chern-Simons Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on integrability in theories of gravity. We show how the stationary, axisymmetric sector of General Relativity can be described by the boundary dynamics of a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. This approach shows promise for simplifying solution generating methods in both General Relativity and higher-dimensional supergravity theories. The four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory presented generalises those for flat space integrable models by introducing a space-time dependent branch cut in the spectral plane. We also make contact with twistor space approaches to integrability, showing how the branch cut defects of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory arise from a discrete reduction of six-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions in $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed Theories on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of local operators in unitary $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a torus, using their formulation in terms of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We focus on the two-point correlation function in momentum space when the undeformed theory is a conformal field theory. The large momentum behavior of the correlation function is computed and compared to that of $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a plane. For the latter, the behavior found was $\left(\frac{\sqrt{t}|q|}{\pi e}\right)^{-\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $q$ is the momentum and $t$ is the deformation parameter. For a torus, the same behavior is found for $|q|&lt;&lt;L/t$, where $L$ is the torus' length scale. However, for $|q|&gt;&gt;L/t$, a different behavior is found: $\left(\frac{2\sqrt{t}^5q^2}{\pi e L^3|T|^2}\right)^{\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $T$ is the modular parameter of the torus. Hence, at large momentum, the correlator decays and then grows. This behavior suggests that operators carrying momentum $q$ are smeared on a distance scale $t|q|$. The difference from the plane's result illustrates the non-locality of the theory and the UV-IR mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field, where the axion forms a flat direction. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry and special features of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ potentials, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to significant modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic Quotient Quiver Subtraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique of orthosymplectic quotient quiver subtraction is introduced. This involves subtraction of an orthosymplectic quotient quiver from a $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ orthosymplectic quiver gauge theory which has the effect of gauging subgroups of the IR Coulomb branch global symmetry. Orthosymplectic quotient quivers for $\mathrm{SU}(2),\;\mathrm{SU}(3),\;G_2,$ and $\mathrm{SO}(7)$ are found and derived from Type IIA brane systems involving negatively charged branes for certain $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ gauge theories. Orthosymplectic quotient quiver subtraction is applied to magnetic quivers for nilpotent orbit closures providing new orthosymplectic counterparts to known unitary quivers. New Coulomb branch constructions are found such as for two height four nilpotent orbit closures of $F_4$ and one of height three. A novel application is to find magnetic quivers and Type IIA brane systems for the $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ worldvolume theory of two $\frac{1}{2}$M5 branes probing $E_6$ Klein singularity and for $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)\;(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter. These give a perturbative Lagrangian realisation to the dynamics of strongly interacting M5 branes. The magnetic quiver for $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)\;(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter is star-shaped and can also be interpreted as a magnetic quiver for a class $\mathcal S$ theory specified by $\mathrm{SO}(26)$ algebra on a three-punctured sphere.</description>

      <title>Renormalization and non-renormalization of scalar EFTs at higher orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We renormalize massless scalar effective field theories (EFTs) to higher loop orders and higher orders in the EFT expansion. To facilitate EFT calculations with the R* renormalization method, we construct suitable operator bases using Hilbert series and related ideas in commutative algebra and conformal representation theory, including their novel application to off-shell correlation functions. We obtain new results ranging from full one loop at mass dimension twelve to five loops at mass dimension six. We explore the structure of the anomalous dimension matrix with an emphasis on its zeros, and investigate the effects of conformal and orthonormal operators. For the real scalar, the zeros can be explained by a `non-renormalization' rule recently derived by Bern et al. For the complex scalar we find two new selection rules for mixing $n$- and $(n-2)$-field operators, with $n$ the maximal number of fields at a fixed mass dimension. The first appears only when the $(n-2)$-field operator is conformal primary, and is valid at one loop. The second appears in more generic bases, and is valid at three loops. Finally, we comment on how the Hilbert series we construct may be used to provide a systematic enumeration of a class of evanescent operators that appear at a particular mass dimension in the scalar EFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first calculation of the response of the momentum space quark propagator to center vortices in the ground state fields of QCD is presented. Center vortices are identified on 2+1-flavour dynamical gauge fields with $m_\pi \simeq 156$ MeV to obtain the vortex-removed and vortex-only quark propagator. Dynamical mass generation is found to vanish upon vortex removal, while the vortex-only field is able to generate dynamical mass. These new signatures strengthen the lattice QCD evidence indicating that center vortices underpin both dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement.</description>

Abstract: We determine the relationship between $\mathbb{C}_p^\times \times \mathbb{C}_p$ and a Berkovich space via an equivalence relation obtained by coarse-graining. This process also establishes a correspondence between $p$-adic fields and Bruhat-Tits trees. From this space, we give a previously unknown construction of the Berkovich projective line $\mathbb{P}_\text{Berk}^1$ and outline a direction for the development of a comprehensive theory of non-Archimedean AdS/CFT and consequently, adelic AdS/CFT, enabled by this construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors with Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are ultra-sensitive detectors of electric fields. By setting up a constant magnetic field, a weak electric field is generated upon the arrival of GWs. The weak electric field signal is then detected by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the system of the Rydberg atoms. Recently, the minimum detectable electric field with the Rydberg atoms is further improved by employing superheterodyne detection method. Hence, even the weak signal generated by GWs turns out to be detectable. We calculate the amplitude of Rabi frequency of the Rydberg atoms induced by the GWs and show that the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms becomes maximum when the size of the Rydberg atoms is close to the wavelength of GWs. We evaluate the minimum detectable amplitude of GWs with Rubidium Rydberg atoms and find that the detector can probe GWs with a frequency $f=4.2$ GHz and an amplitude around $10^{-20}$.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Promptly after high-resolution experiments harbinger the field of precision cosmology low- and high-redshift observations abruptly gave rise to a tension in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe ($H_0$) and the clustering of matter ($S_8$). The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions. This setup relies on an empirical conjecture, which postulates that $\Lambda$ switched sign (from negative to positive) at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. We reexamine a stringy model that can describe the transition in the vacuum energy hypothesized in $\Lambda_s$CDM. The model makes use of the Casimir forces driven by fields inhabiting the incredible bulk of the dark dimension scenario. Unlike the $\Lambda_s$CDM setup the model deviates from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe due to the existence of relativistic neutrino-like species. Using the Boltzmann solver CLASS in combination with MontePython we confront predictions of the stringy model to experimental data (from the Planck mission, Pantheon+ supernova type Ia, BAO, and KiDS-1000). We show that the string-inspired model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and can resolve the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which significantly extends a previous approach in a specific noise model to arbitrary noisy models. In our constructions, it is crucial to use the QSVT-based FPAA, demonstrating for the first time the separation between any other amplitude amplification algorithms and the QSVT-based one in the application. We also show that the proposed decoders have high decoding performance and reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder.</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transitions of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Spinor-helicity calculation of the $g^* g^* \to q\overline{q} V^*$ amplitude at the tree level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute amplitudes for the process $g^* g^* \to q \overline q V^*$ (two virtual gluons into a quark, antiquark and a boson) at the tree level using the spinor-helicity formalism. The resulting analytic expressions are much shorter than squared amplitudes obtained using trace methods. Our results can be used to expedite numerical calculations in phenomenological studies of the Drell-Yan process in high energy factorization framework.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections to phase-transition parameters in dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov-loop potential depending on temperature and the chiral chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-global logarithms up to four loops at finite-N$_c$ for V/H+jet processes at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work [1] on calculating non-global logarithms in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation to Higgs/vector boson production in association with a single hard jet at hadron colliders. We analytically compute non-global coefficients in the jet mass distribution up to four loops using the anti-k$_t$ jet algorithm. Our calculations are performed in the eikonal approximation, assuming strong energy ordering for the emitted gluons, thus capturing only the leading logarithms of the distribution. We compare our analytical results with the all-orders large-N$_c$ numerical solution. In general, the gross features of the non-global logarithm distribution observed in the $e^+ e^-$ case remain valid for the V/H+jet processes.</description>

      <title>Morris-Thorne-type wormhole with global monopole charge and the energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Morris-Thorne-type wormholes with global monopole charge using various shape function forms known in the literature. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter-content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and pole/cut structure in retarded correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to discuss the following two questions:
  Q1. Mathematical justification of the model of relaxation time approximation (RTA);
  Q2. Pole/cut structure in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description.
  We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Furthermore, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived non-analytical structures in this case. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenspectrum leads to dominant long-lived branch-cuts. When particles are massive or the perturbations are inhomogeneous, the non-analytical structures become more complex and richer.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes. Using the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov exponent indicator, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction, we present the effects of the swirling parameter and the spin parameter on the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles, and confirm the presence of chaos in the motion of particles in this background spacetime. We find that the swirling parameter can change the range of the spin parameter where the chaos occurs, and vice versa. Moreover, we observe clearly that, regardless of the spin parameter, there exist some self-similar fractal fine structures in the basins boundaries of attractors for the spacetime of a black hole immersed in swirling universes. The combination the swirling parameter and the spin parameter provides richer physics in the motion of particles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>
