      <title>Statistical Arbitrage in Rank Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equity market dynamics are conventionally investigated in name space where stocks are indexed by company names. In contrast, by indexing stocks based on their ranks in capitalization, we gain a different perspective of market dynamics in rank space. Here, we demonstrate the superior performance of statistical arbitrage in rank space over name space, driven by a robust market representation and enhanced mean-reverting properties of residual returns in rank space. Our statistical arbitrage algorithm features an intraday rebalancing mechanism for effective conversion between portfolios in name and rank space. We explore statistical arbitrage with and without neural networks in both name and rank space and show that the portfolios obtained in rank space with neural networks significantly outperform those in name space.</description>

      <title>First order Martingale model risk and semi-static hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for functionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained to the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal law. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartlsensitivityadapted} by introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with respect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit characterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging strategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized FGM dependence: Geometrical representation and convex bounds on sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the one-to-one relationship between generalized FGM copulas and multivariate Bernoulli distributions, we prove that the class of multivariate distributions with generalized FGM copulas is a convex polytope. Therefore, we find sharp bounds in this class for many aggregate risk measures, such as value-at-risk, expected shortfall, and entropic risk measure, by enumerating their values on the extremal points of the convex polytope. This is infeasible in high dimensions. We overcome this limitation by considering the aggregation of identically distributed risks with generalized FGM copula specified by a common parameter $p$. In this case, the analogy with the geometrical structure of the class of Bernoulli distribution allows us to provide sharp analytical bounds for convex risk measures.</description>

      <title>Hedging via Perpetual Derivatives: Trinomial Option Pricing and Implied Parameter Surface Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fairly general, recombining trinomial tree model in the natural world. Market-completeness is ensured by considering a market consisting of two risky assets, a riskless asset, and a European option. The two risky assets consist of a stock and a perpetual derivative of that stock. The option has the stock and its derivative as its underlying. Using a replicating portfolio, we develop prices for European options and generate the unique relationships between the risk-neutral and real-world parameters of the model. We discuss calibration of the model to empirical data in the cases in which the risky asset returns are treated as either arithmetic or logarithmic. From historical price and call option data for select large cap stocks, we develop implied parameter surfaces for the real-world parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Distance between closed sets and the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to clarify when the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations stay close to a given subset of the state space for starting points which are close as well. This includes results for deterministic partial differential equations. As an example, we will consider the situation where the subset is a finite dimensional submanifold with boundary. We also discuss applications to mathematical finance, namely the modeling of the evolution of interest rate curves.</description>
