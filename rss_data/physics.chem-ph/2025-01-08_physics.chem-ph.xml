      <title>Partial Auger Decay Widths from Complex-Valued Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a new strategy to compute partial Auger decay widths with equation-of-motion ionisation-potential coupled-cluster (EOMIP-CCSD) wave functions in the framework of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where the decaying character of the metastable states is described via complex-scaled basis functions. While the total decay width can generally be obtained from the energy eigenvalues, the computation of partial decay widths, i. e. the contributions of channels to the total decay rate, governing their probability distribution, is less trivial. In the past, methods where channels are projected out during the EOMIP-CCSD iteration have been developed (Auger Channel Projector), but such a procedure requires to establish convergence of the excitation vector for each separately. Furthermore, they suffer from interaction between the channels upon perturbation of the wave function.
  In contrast, we suggest to compute the contribution of the two-electron transition that Auger decay implies, where two valence electrons are involved, one refilling the core hole and one emitted to the continuum, from the respective entries in the two-electron density matrix that describe the extent of this transition in the wave function upon application of correlation and excitation operator. In this way, we obtain all partial decay widths from wave functions determined in the full excitation manifold. The results from this approach compare very well to the Auger Channel Projector results: we compute spectra for K-edge ionised states of methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, and the cyanide anion, as well as Coster-Kronig spectra of L1-edge ionised hydrogen sulfide, which differ only negligibly between the two methods. A spectrum of the cyanide anion has not been reported before -- we discuss the selectivity of the decay process with respect to the initial state and the possibility of interatomic Auger decay.</description>

      <title>Probing growth precursor diffusion lengths by inter-surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing thin-film synthesis requires measuring the diffusion length $d_\alpha$ of adsorbed growth precursors. Despite technological advances, in-situ measurements of $d_\alpha$ are often unachievable due to harsh deposition conditions, such as high temperatures or reactive environments. In this paper, we propose a fitting approach to determine $d_\alpha$ from experimental data by leveraging inter-surface diffusion between a substrate and a strip obtained by, for example, processing a film. The substrate serves as a source or sink of precursors, influencing the growth dynamics and shaping the profile of the strip. By fitting simulated profiles to given profiles, we demonstrate that $d_\alpha$ can be determined. To achieve this, we develop a theoretical growth model, a simulation strategy, and a fitting procedure. The growth model incorporates inter-surface diffusion, adsorption, and desorption of growth precursors, with growth being proportional to the concentration of adsorbed precursors. In our simulations, a chain of nodes represents a profile, and growth is captured by the displacement of those nodes, while keeping the node density approximately constant. For strips significantly wider than $d_\alpha$, a scaled precursor concentration and $d_\alpha$ are the fitting parameters that are determined by minimizing a suitably defined measure of the distance between simulated and given profiles. We evaluate the robustness of our procedure by analyzing the effect of profile resolution and noise on the fitted parameters. Our approach can offer valuable insights into thin-film growth processes, such as those occurring during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.</description>

      <title>Simulating Ionized States in Realistic Chemical Environments With Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory and Polarizable Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical simulations of electron detachment processes are vital for understanding chemical redox reactions, semiconductor and electrochemical properties, and high-energy radiation damage. However, accurate calculations of ionized electronic states are very challenging due to their open-shell nature, importance of electron correlation effects, and strong interactions with chemical environment. In this work, we present an efficient approach based on algebraic diagrammatic construction theory with polarizable embedding that allows to accurately simulate ionized electronic states in condensed-phase or biochemical environments (PE-IP-ADC). We showcase the capabilities of PE-IP-ADC by computing the vertical ionization energy (VIE) of thymine molecule solvated in bulk water. Our results show that the second- and third-order PE-IP-ADC methods combined with the basis of set of triple-zeta quality yield a solvent-induced shift in VIE of -0.92 and -0.93 eV, respectively, in an excellent agreement with experimental estimate of -0.9 eV. This work demonstrates the power of PE-IP-ADC approach for simulating charged electronic states in realistic chemical environments and motivates its further development.</description>

      <title>Magnteically Induced Current Density from Numerical Positional Derivatives of Nucleus Independent Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instead of computing magneticallly induced (MI) current densities (CD) via the wave function and their quatum mechanical definition one can also use the differential form of the Amp\`ere-Maxwell law to obtain them from spatial derivatives of the induced magnetic field. In magnetic molecular response calculations, the latter can be done by numerical derivativation of the so called ``nucleus-independent chemical shifts'' (NICS) which are avaialable to many standard quantum chemical programs. The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to other numerically obtained MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>
