      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. We compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) the extension of the dual splitting method originally proposed by G.E. Karniadakis et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 97, 414-443, 1991) towards non-constant viscosity, ii) a higher-order DG method for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, iii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iv) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Active Digital Twins via Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins are transforming engineering and applied sciences by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive analysis of physical systems and processes. However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and predictive maintenance of a railway bridge.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Climate-Resilient Insurance and Real Estate Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events increasingly threaten the insurance and real estate industries, creating conflicts between profitability and homeowner burdens. To address this, we propose the SSC-Insurance Model, which integrates SMOTE, SVM, and C-D-C algorithms to evaluate weather impacts on policies and investments. Our model achieves 88.3% accuracy in Zhejiang and 79.6% in Ireland, identifying a critical threshold (43% weather increase) for insurance viability. Additionally, we develop the TOA-Preservation Model using TOPSIS-ORM and AHP to prioritize building protection, with cultural value scoring highest (weight: 0.3383). Case studies on Nanxun Ancient Town show a 65.32% insurability probability and a protection score of 0.512. This work provides actionable tools for insurers, developers, and policymakers to manage climate risks sustainably.</description>

      <title>Optimistic MEV in Ethereum Layer 2s: Why Blockspace Is Always in Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layer 2 rollups are rapidly absorbing DeFi activity, securing over $40 billion and accounting for nearly half of Ethereum's DEX volume by Q1 2025, yet their MEV dynamics remain understudied. We address this gap by defining and quantifying optimistic MEV, a form of speculative, on-chain cyclic arbitrage whose detection and execution logic reside largely on-chain in smart contracts. As a result of their speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification, optimistic MEV transactions frequently fail to execute a profitable arbitrage.
  Applying our multi-stage identification pipeline to Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, we find that in Q1 2025, optimistic MEV accounts for over 50% of on-chain gas on Base and Optimism and 7% on Arbitrum, driven mainly by "interaction" probes (on-chain computations searching for arbitrage). This speculative probing keeps blocks on Base and Optimism persistently full. Despite consuming over half of on-chain gas, optimistic MEV transactions pay less than one quarter of total gas fees. Cross-network comparison reveals divergent success rates, differing patterns of code reuse, and sensitivity to varying sequencer ordering and block production times. Finally, OLS regressions link optimistic MEV trade count to ETH volatility, retail trading activity, and DEX aggregator usage, showing how Layer 2 protocol parameters uniquely encourage speculative MEV.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Charging Scheduling via Balanced Bounding Box Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric mobility faces several challenges, most notably the high cost of infrastructure development and the underutilization of charging stations. The concept of shared charging offers a promising solution. The paper explores sustainable urban logistics through horizontal collaboration between two fleet operators and addresses a scheduling problem for the shared use of charging stations. To tackle this, the study formulates a collaborative scheduling problem as a bi-objective nonlinear integer programming model, in which each company aims to minimize its own costs, creating inherent conflicts that require trade-offs. The Balanced Bounding Box Methods (B3Ms) are introduced in order to efficiently derive the efficient frontier, identifying a reduced set of representative solutions. These methods enhance computational efficiency by selectively disregarding closely positioned and competing solutions, preserving the diversity and representativeness of the solutions over the efficient frontier. To determine the final solution and ensure balanced collaboration, cooperative bargaining methods are applied. Numerical case studies demonstrate the viability and scalability of the developed methods, showing that the B3Ms can significantly reduce computational time while maintaining the integrity of the frontier. These methods, along with cooperative bargaining, provide an effective framework for solving various bi-objective optimization problems, extending beyond the collaborative scheduling problem presented here.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>Effect of Selection Format on LLM Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a critical aspect of large language model (LLM) performance: the optimal formatting of classification task options in prompts. Through an extensive experimental study, we compared two selection formats -- bullet points and plain English -- to determine their impact on model performance. Our findings suggest that presenting options via bullet points generally yields better results, although there are some exceptions. Furthermore, our research highlights the need for continued exploration of option formatting to drive further improvements in model performance.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>

      <title>Exact Characterization of Aggregate Flexibility via Generalized Polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the aggregate flexibility inherent in populations of distributed energy resources (DERs) can be leveraged to mitigate the intermittency and uncertainty associated with renewable generation, while also providing ancillary grid services. To enable this, aggregators must effectively represent the flexibility in the populations they control to the market or system operator. A key challenge is accurately computing the aggregate flexibility of a population, which can be formally expressed as the Minkowski sum of a collection of polytopes, a problem that is generally computationally intractable. However, the flexibility polytopes of many DERs exhibit structural symmetries that can be exploited for computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, into the flexibility aggregation literature. We demonstrate that individual flexibility sets belong to this family, enabling efficient computation of their exact Minkowski sum. For homogeneous populations of DERs we further derive simplifications that yield more succinct representations of aggregate flexibility. Additionally, we develop an efficient optimization framework over these sets and propose a vertex-based disaggregation method, to allocate aggregate flexibility among individual DERs. Finally, we validate the optimality and computational efficiency of our approach through comparisons with existing methods.</description>
