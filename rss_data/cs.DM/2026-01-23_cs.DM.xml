      <title>Existential Positive Transductions of Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monadic stability generalizes many tameness notions from structural graph theory such as planarity, bounded degree, bounded tree-width, and nowhere density. The sparsification conjecture predicts that the (possibly dense) monadically stable graph classes are exactly those that can be logically encoded by first-order (FO) transductions in the (always sparse) nowhere dense classes. So far this conjecture has been verified for several special cases, such as for classes of bounded shrub-depth, and for the monadically stable fragments of bounded (linear) clique-width, twin-width, and merge-width.
  In this work we propose the existential positive sparsification conjecture, predicting that the more restricted co-matching-free, monadically stable classes are exactly those that can be transduced from nowhere dense classes using only existential positive FO formulas. While the general conjecture remains open, we verify its truth for all known special cases of the original conjecture. Even stronger, we find the sparse preimages as subgraphs of the dense input graphs.
  As a key ingredient, we introduce a new combinatorial operation, called subflip, that arises as the natural co-matching-free analog of the flip operation, which is a central tool in the characterization of monadic stability. Using subflips, we characterize the co-matching-free fragment of monadic stability by appropriate strengthenings of the known flip-flatness and flipper game characterizations for monadic stability. In an attempt to generalize our results to the more expressive MSO logic, we discover (rediscover?) that on relational structures (existential) positive MSO has the same expressive power as (existential) positive FO.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.
  We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>

      <title>All ascents exponential from valued constraint graphs of pathwidth three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as finding as assignment that maximized some pseudo-Boolean function (that we call the fitness function). Strict local search starts with some assignment and follows some update rule to proceed to an adjacent assignment of strictly higher fitness. This means that strict local search algorithms follow ascents in the fitness landscape of the pseudo-Boolean function. The complexity of the pseudo-Boolean function (and the fitness landscapes that it represents) can be parameterized by properties of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) that encodes the pseudo-Boolean function. We focus on properties of the constraint graphs of the VCSP, with the intuition that spare graphs are less complex than dense ones. Specifically, we argue that pathwidth is the natural sparsity parameter for understanding limits on the power of strict local search. We show that prior constructions of sparse VCSPs where all ascents are exponentially long had pathwidth greater than or equal to four. We improve this this with our controlled doubling construction: a valued constraint satisfaction problem of pathwidth three where all ascents are exponentially long from a designated initial assignment. From this, we conclude that all strict local search algorithms can be forced to take an exponential number of steps even on simple valued constraint graphs of pathwidth three.</description>

      <title>Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $\Delta$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix.
  Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory.
  First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$.
  Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = \Omega(k \Delta)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Myrvold's Results on Orthogonal Triples of $10 \times 10$ Latin Squares: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since E. T. Parker constructed an orthogonal pair of $10\times10$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal triple of $10\times10$ Latin squares has been one of the most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a $4\times4$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple, twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved. As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the triple must necessarily be considered as well.
  Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases. To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares. Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under two hours of computing on a large computing cluster.</description>
