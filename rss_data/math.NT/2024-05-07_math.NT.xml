      <title>Metric bootstraps for limsup sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metric Diophantine approximation, one frequently encounters the problem of showing that a limsup set has positive or full measure. Often it is a set of points in $m$-dimensional Euclidean space, or a set of $n$-by-$m$ systems of linear forms, satisfying some approximation condition infinitely often. The main results of this paper are bootstraps: if one can establish positive measure for such a limsup set in $m$-dimensional Euclidean space, then one can establish positive or full measure for an associated limsup set in the setting of $n$-by-$m$ systems of linear forms. Consequently, a class of $m$-dimensional results in Diophantine approximation can be bootstrapped to corresponding $n$-by-$m$-dimensional results. This leads to short proofs of existing, new, and hypothetical theorems for limsup sets that arise in the theory of systems of linear forms. We present several of these.</description>

      <title>On the irreducibility of $f(2^n,3^m,X)$ and other such polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(t_1, \ldots, t_r, X)\in \mathbb{Z}[t_1, \ldots, t_r,X]$ be irreducible and let $a_1, \ldots, a_r\in \mathbb{Z} \smallsetminus \{0,\pm 1\}$. Under a necessary ramification assumption on $f$, and conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we show that for almost all integers $n_1, \ldots, n_r$, the polynomial $f(a_1^{n_1}, \ldots, a_r^{n_r}, X)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$.</description>

      <title>Harper's beyond square-root conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how the (shifted) Ratios Conjecture for $L(s,\chi)$ would extend a randomization argument of Harper from a conductor-limited range to an unlimited range of ``beyond square-root cancellation'' for character twists of the Liouville function. As a corollary, the Liouville function would have nontrivial cancellation in arithmetic progressions of modulus just exceeding the well-known square-root barrier. Morally, the paper passes from random matrices to random multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>A Design Criterion for the Rayleigh Fading Wiretap Channel Based on $\ell^1$-norm Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the correct decoding probability of an eavesdropper and error probability of a legitimate receiver in a Rayleigh fading wiretap channel with lattice coset coding are both upper bounded by the theta function in the $\ell^1$-norm of the dual code lattices. Motivated by these findings, we derive a closed form expression for the $\ell^1$-norm theta function of any sublattice of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ and its dual, and prove that the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ minimizes the theta function among all scalings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ along the coordinate axes. Furthermore, we develop a method to algorithmically find locally critical lattice packings of the $n$-dimensional cross-polytope. Using this method, we are able to construct a four-dimensional lattice having a packing density of $\Delta\approx 0.824858$ and kissing number 30, improving on the best known lattice packing density of the cross-polytope in dimension four.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general convergence result for zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector spaces extending results of H. Saito, F. Sato and Yukie. Our analysis points to certain subspaces which yield boundary terms. We study it further in the setup arising from nilpotent orbits. In certain cases we determine the residue at the rightmost pole of the zeta function.</description>

      <title>On the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an Conjecture and the growth of $B_{2}[g]$ sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $g\in\mathbb{N}$ we say that $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ is a $B_{2}[g]$ sequence if every $m\in\mathbb{N}$ has at most $g$ distinct representations of the shape $m=b_{1}+b_{2}$ with $b_{1}\leq b_{2}$ and $b_{1},b_{2}\in A$. We show for every $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ that whenever $g&gt;\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ then there is a $B_{2}[g]$ sequence $A$ having the property that every sufficiently large $n\in\mathbb{N}$ can be written as $$n=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3},\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a_{3}\leq n^{\varepsilon}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a_{i}\in A,$$ and satisfying for large $x$ the estimate $$\lvert A\cap [1,x]\rvert\gg x^{g/(2g+1)}.$$ The above lower bound improves upon earlier results of Cilleruelo and of Erd\H{o}s and Renyi.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Neural Network Approach for Numerical Solutions of Fractional Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the authors propose the utilization of Fibonacci Neural Networks (FNN) for solving arbitrary order differential equations. The FNN architecture comprises input, middle, and output layers, with various degrees of Fibonacci polynomials serving as activation functions in the middle layer. The trial solution of the differential equation is treated as the output of the FNN, which involves adjustable parameters (weights). These weights are iteratively updated during the training of the Fibonacci neural network using backpropagation. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by solving five differential problems with known exact solutions, allowing for an assessment of its accuracy. Comparative analyses are conducted against previously established techniques, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficacy in solving the addressed problems.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Wooley and lower bounds for cubic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{Q}}^{n-1}$ be a cubic hypersurface cut out by the vanishing of a non-degenerate rational cubic form in $n$ variables. Let $N(X,B)$ denote the number of rational points on $X$ of height at most $B$. In this article we obtain lower bounds for $N(X,B)$ for cubic hypersufaces, provided only that $n$ is large enough. In particular, we show that $N(X,B) \gg B^{n-9}$ if $n \geq 39$, thereby proving a conjecture of T. D. Wooley for non-conical cubic hypersurfaces with large enough dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores Iwasawa theory from a graph theoretic perspective, focusing on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs. Using representation theory, we analyze Iwasawa-theoretic invariants within $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs, revealing connections between graph theory, number theory, and group theory. Key results include the factorization of associated Iwasawa polynomials and the decomposition of $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants. Additionally, we apply these insights to complete graphs, establishing conditions under which these invariants vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an assumption on linear forms $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k: \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{F}_p$ that is much weaker than approximate joint equidistribution on the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ and is in a sense almost as weak as linear independence, but which guarantees that every subset of $\{0,1\}^n$ on which none of $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k$ has full image has a density which tends to 0 with $k$. This density is at most quasipolynomially small in $k$, a bound that is necessarily close to sharp.</description>

      <title>Ekedahl-Oort strata and the supersingular locus in the GU(q-2,2) Shimura variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. It is natural to ask which Ekedahl-Oort strata intersect the unique closed Newton stratum, called the \emph{supersingular locus}. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give information about the interaction between the two stratifications for general signature $(q-2,2)$, and as an application, we completely answer this question for the signature $(3,2)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that a finite coloring of an amenable group contains `many' monochromatic sets of the form $\{x,y,xy,yx\},$ and natural extensions with more variables. This gives the first combinatorial proof and extensions of Bergelson and McCutcheon's non-commutative Schur theorem. Our main new tool is the introduction of what we call `quasirandom colorings,' a condition that is automatically satisfied by colorings of quasirandom groups, and a reduction to this case.</description>

      <title>Purity for Perfectoidness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a long-standing question about whether being perfectoid for an algebra is local in the analytic topology. We provide affirmative answers for the algebras (e.g., over $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$) whose spectra are inverse limits of semi-stable affine schemes. In fact, we established a valuative criterion for such an algebra being perfectoid, saying that it suffices to check the perfectoidness of the stalks of the associated Riemann-Zariski space. Combining with Gabber-Ramero's computation of differentials of valuation rings, we obtain a differential criterion for perfectoidness. We also establish a purity result for perfectoidness when the limit preserves generic points of the special fibres.
  As an application to limits of smooth $p$-adic varieties (on the generic point), assuming either the poly-stable modification conjecture or working only with curves, we prove that stalk-wise perfectoidness implies vanishing of the higher completed \'etale cohomology groups of the smooth varieties, which is inspired by Scholze's vanishing for Shimura varieties. Moreover, we give an explicit description of the completed \'etale cohomology group in the top degree in terms of the colimit of Zariski cohomology groups of the structural sheaves.</description>

Abstract: We examine the ramification groups of finite Galois extensions over complete discrete valuation fields of equal characteristic $p&gt;0$. Brylinski (1983) calculated the ramification groups in the case where the Galois groups are abelian. We extend the results of Brylinski to some non-abelian cases where the Galois groups are of order $\leq p^{p+1}$ and of maximal nilpotency class.</description>

      <title>Families of sequences with good family complexity and cross-correlation measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.13938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study pseudorandomness of a family of sequences in terms of two measures, the family complexity ($f$-complexity) and the cross-correlation measure of order $\ell$. We consider sequences not only on binary alphabet but also on $k$-symbols ($k$-ary) alphabet. We first generalize some known methods on construction of the family of binary pseudorandom sequences. We prove a bound on the $f$-complexity of a large family of binary sequences of Legendre-symbols of certain irreducible polynomials. We show that this family as well as its dual family have both a large family complexity and a small cross-correlation measure up to a rather large order. Next, we present another family of binary sequences having high $f$-complexity and low cross-correlation measure. Then we extend the results to the family of sequences on $k$-symbols alphabet.</description>
