      <title>Kullback-Leibler Potential for Non-Ergodic Replication Dynamics:An Information-Theoretic Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to quantify and visualize the degradation of fidelity (information degradation) that inevitably accompanies the replication of information within the framework of information thermodynamics and to propose an information-theoretic formulation of the second law based on this phenomenon. While previous research in information thermodynamics has focused on the thermodynamic costs associated with information "erasure'' or "measurement'' through concepts such as Landauer's principle and mutual information, little systematic discussion has addressed the inherently irreversible nature of "replication'' itself and the accompanying degradation of information structure. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of information replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution, and quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy, cross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic decrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as a potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a nonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information processes such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for degradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD. This contributes to building a unified information-thermodynamic framework for operations such as replication, transmission, and repair of information.</description>

      <title>Structural Decomposition of Moran's Index by Getis-Ord's Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moran's index and Getis-Ord,s indices are important statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation analysis. Each of them has its own function and scope of application. However, the association of Moran index with Getis-Ord index is not clear. This paper is devoted to deriving and verify the relationships between Moran's index and Getis-Ord's indices using mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. Getis-Ord's indices are employed to decompose Moran's index. The results show that there is a strict nonlinear relationship between Moran's index and Getis-Ord's indices. Moran's index consists of four components: global Getis-Ord's index, sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, number of elements, and size correlation function. Thus the mathematical structure of Moran's index is revealed. A theoretical discovery is that the characteristics of spatial autocorrelation depends on the relationship between the global Getis-Ord's index and the sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, as well as the number of spatial elements. Local Getis-Ord's indices proved to be equivalent to the potential indices based on gravity model. A conclusion can be drawn that Moran's index is related to gravity model, and thus spatial autocorrelation is associated with spatial interaction. This indicates that weak spatial interaction leads to not significant spatial autocorrelation. The conclusion is supported by observational data. This study not only helps to better understand the basic statistics of spatial analysis, but also contributes to the further development of spatial autocorrelation theory.</description>

      <title>Classification of Hoyle State Decay Branches in Active Target Time Projection Chamber using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been developed using Keras deep learning library in Python for image-based classification of $^{12}$C Hoyle state decay branches from tracking information, recorded by Saha Active Target Time Projection Chamber, SAT-TPC (currently under development). The nuclear events, produced by the 30 MeV $\alpha$-particle beam in the SAT-TPC, filled with Ar + CO$_2$ (90:10) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure, have been considered for training and validation of the models. The elastic scattering and Hoyle state sequential and direct decay events in the interaction of $\alpha$-particle with $^{40}$Ar, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclei have been generated through Monte-Carlo simulation. The three-dimensional tracks, produced by the scattering and decay products through primary ionization of gaseous medium, have been simulated with Geant4. The primary tracks, distributed on the beam-plane, have been convoluted with electron diffusion, obtained with Magboltz, to produce the final tracking information. The classification performance of the proposed model for different readout segmentation schemes of the SAT-TPC has been discussed.</description>
