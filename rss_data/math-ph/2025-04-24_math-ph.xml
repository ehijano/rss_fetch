      <title>Symplectic approach to global stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of proving global stability, based on symplectic geometry and with a focus on systems with several conserved quantities. We also provide a proof of instability for integrable systems whose momentum map is everywhere regular. Our results take root in the recently proposed notion of a confining function and are motivated by ghost-ridden systems, for whom we put forward the first geometric definition.</description>

      <title>On Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds and topological difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1,m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas with $k\ge3$.</description>

      <title>On the four-body lima\c{c}on choreography: maximal superintegrability and choreographic fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [Fernandez-Guasti, \textit{Celest Mech Dyn Astron} 137, 4 (2025)], we demonstrate the maximal superintegrability of the reduced Hamiltonian, which governs the four-body choreographic planar motion along the lima\c{c}on trisectrix (resembling a folded figure eight), in the six-dimensional space of relative motion. The corresponding eleven integrals of motion in the Liouville-Arnold sense are presented explicitly. Specifically, it is shown that the reduced Hamiltonian admits complete separation of variables in Jacobi-like variables. The emergence of this choreography is not a direct consequence of maximal superintegrability. Rather, it originates from the existence of \textit{particular integrals} and the phenomenon of \textit{particular involution}. The fragmentation of a more general four-body choreographic motion into two isomorphic two-body choreographies is discussed in detail. This model combines choreographic motion with maximal superintegrability, a seldom-studied interplay in classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Complex tridiagonal quantum Hamiltonians and matrix continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resonances described by non-Hermitian tridiagonal-matrix Hamiltonians $H$ with complex energy eigenvalues $E_n \in {\mathbb C}$ are considered. The method of evaluation of quantities $\sigma_n=\sqrt{E_n^*E_n}$ known as the singular values of $H$ is proposed. Its basic idea is that the quantities $\sigma_n$ can be treated as square roots of eigenvalues of a certain auxiliary self-adjoint operator $\mathbb{H}$. As long as such an operator can be given a block-tridiagonal matrix form, we construct its resolvent as a matrix continued fraction. In an illustrative application of the formalism, a discrete version of conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ with complex local $V(x) \neq V^*(x)$ is considered. The numerical convergence of the recipe is found quick, supported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the equations of motion of the rigid body about a fixed point in the Newtonian field with a quadratic potential are special reduction of period-one closure of the Darboux dressing chain for the Schr\"odinger operators with matrix potentials. Some new explicit solutions of the corresponding matrix system and the spectral properties of the related Schr\"odinger operators are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits Of Quickest Change-point Detection With Continuous-Variable Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the quantum CUSUM (QUSUM) algorithm for quickest change-point detection, analyzed in finite dimensions by Fanizza, Hirche, and Calsamiglia (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020602, 2023), to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of a result by Hayashi (Hayashi, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 3413, 2001) concerning the asymptotics of quantum relative entropy, which we establish for the infinite-dimensional setting. This enables us to prove that the QUSUM strategy retains its asymptotic optimality, characterized by the relationship between the expected detection delay and the average false alarm time for any pair of states with finite relative entropy. Consequently, our findings apply broadly, including continuous-variable systems (e.g., Gaussian states), facilitating the development of optimal change-point detection schemes in quantum optics and other physical platforms, and rendering experimental verification feasible.</description>

      <title>Qubit Geometry through Holomorphic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a wave mechanics formalism for qubit geometry using holomorphic functions and Mobius transformations, providing a geometric perspective on quantum computation. This framework extends the standard Hilbert space description, offering a natural interpretation of standard quantum gates on the Riemann sphere that is examined through their Mobius action on holomorphic wavefunction. These wavefunctions emerge via a quantization process, with the Riemann sphere serving as the classical phase space of qubit geometry. We quantize this space using canonical group quantization with holomorphic polarization, yielding holomorphic wavefunctions and spin angular momentum operators that recover the standard $SU(2)$ algebra with interesting geometric properties. Such properties reveal how geometric transformations induce quantum logic gates on the Riemann sphere, providing a novel perspective in quantum information processing. This result provides a new direction for exploring quantum computation through Isham's canonical group quantization and its holomorphic polarization method.</description>

      <title>Mass-Critical Neutron Stars in the Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs in the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories. It is known that the system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational constant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical mass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional swarmalator model with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a simple two-dimensional swarmalator model that incorporates higher-order phase interactions, uncovering a diverse range of collective states. The latter include spatially coherent and gas-like configurations, neither of which appear in models with only pairwise interactions. Additionally, we discover bistability between various states, a phenomenon that arises directly from the inclusion of higher-order interactions. By analyzing several of these emergent states analytically, both for identical and nonidentical populations of swarmalators, we gain deeper insights into their underlying mechanisms and stability conditions. Our findings broaden the understanding of swarmalator dynamics and open new avenues for exploring complex collective behaviors in systems governed by higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, we construct solutions to the 3D Euler equations which dissipate kinetic energy with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity, such that the associated Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. The proof is based on the non-uniqueness of positive solutions to the corresponding transport equations, in conjunction with the superposition principle. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $1&lt;p&lt;2,\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{s}&gt;1+\frac1d$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $C_tL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,s}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new axion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the axions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial boundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which shows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire half-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of density-functional theory for quantum-electrodynamical model systems is provided. In particular, the quantum Rabi model, the Dicke model, and a generalization of the latter to multiple modes are considered. We prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that manifests the magnetization and displacement as internal variables, along with several representability results. The constrained-search functionals for pure states and ensembles are introduced and analyzed. We find the optimizers for the pure-state constrained-search functional to be low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and, based on the properties of the optimizers, we formulate an adiabatic-connection formula. In the reduced case of the Rabi model we can even show differentiability of the universal density functional, which amounts to unique pure-state v-representability.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Equipartition Theorems in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) in information theory establishes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states behave in a way that is similar to uniform states. In particular, with appropriate smoothing, for such states both the min and the max relative entropy asymptotically coincide with the relative entropy. In this paper, we generalize several such equipartition properties to states on general von Neumann algebras.
  First, we show that the smooth max relative entropy of i.i.d. states on a von Neumann algebra has an asymptotic rate given by the quantum relative entropy. In fact, our AEP not only applies to states, but also to quantum channels with appropriate restrictions. In addition, going beyond the i.i.d. assumption, we show that for states that are produced by a sequential process of quantum channels, the smooth max relative entropy can be upper bounded by the sum of appropriate channel relative entropies.
  Our main technical contributions are to extend to the context of general von Neumann algebras a chain rule for quantum channels, as well as an additivity result for the channel relative entropy with a replacer channel.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>A holographic global uniqueness in passive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^3$. We show that the restriction of $\psi$ to any ray $L$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $\Im\psi$ on an interval of this ray. As a corollary, the restriction of $\psi$ to any plane $X$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by $\Im\psi$ on an open domain in this plane. These results have holographic prototypes in the recent work Novikov (2024, Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 325, 218-223). In particular, these and known results imply a holographic type global uniqueness in passive imaging and for the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem (from boundary values of the spectral measure in the whole space) in the monochromatic case. Some other surfaces for measurements instead of the planes $X$ are also considered.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed paths up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>Maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in the 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$, whose parametrization space can be identified with the cotangent bundle $T^*T_0(1)$ of Weil-Petersson universal Teichm\"uller space $T_0(1)$. We prove that the Mess map defines a symplectic diffeomorphism from $T^*T_0(1)$ to $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$, with respect to the canonical symplectic form on $T^*T_0(1)$ and the difference of pullbacks of the Weil-Petersson symplectic forms from each factor of $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$. Furthermore, we show that the functional given by the anti-holomorphic energies of the induced Gauss maps associated with maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class serves as a K\"ahler potential for the restriction of the canonical symplectic form to certain submanifolds $T_0(1)^\pm \subset T^*T_0(1)$, which bijectively parametrize the space of maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.</description>

      <title>On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with Scalars-Dependent Coupling $\theta$-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields, that is the generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs with additional scalars-dependent coupling $\theta$-term. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons by taking most general BPS Lagrangian density. We obtain more general Bogomolnyi's equations and a relation between all scalars dependent couplings. From these equations we can see there is a family of BPS monopole solutions parameterized by a real constant $\gamma$, while for BPS dyons there is an additional parameter which is the coupling of $\theta$-term. Interestingly even for a single BPS dyon we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling only gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, which is in accordance with Witten's result in Phys.Lett.B 86 (1979), and thus can determine whether we get BPS monopoles or BPS dyons.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>
