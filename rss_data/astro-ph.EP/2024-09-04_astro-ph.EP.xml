      <title>The dark days are overcast: Iron-bearing clouds on HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b can explain low dayside albedos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the geometric albedo spectra of hot Jupiter exoplanets HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b, based on global climate model (GCMs) post-processed with kinetic cloud models. We predict WASP-43 b to be cloudy throughout its dayside, while HD 209458 b has a clear upper atmosphere around the hot sub-solar point, largely due to the inclusion of strong optical absorbers TiO and VO in the GCM for the latter causes a temperature inversion. In both cases our models find low geometric albedos - 0.026 for WASP-43b and 0.028 for HD 209458 b when averaged over the CHEOPS bandpass of 0.35 - 1.1 microns - indicating dark daysides, similar to the low albedos measured by observations. We demonstrate the strong impact of clouds that contain Fe-bearing species on the modelled geometric albedos; without Fe-bearing species forming in the clouds, the albedos of both planets would be much higher (0.518 for WASP-43 b, 1.37 for HD 209458 b). We conclude that a cloudy upper or mid-to-lower atmosphere that contains strongly absorbing Fe-bearing aerosol species, is an alternative to a cloud-free atmosphere in explaining the low dayside albedos of hot Jupiter atmospheres such as HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b.</description>

      <title>Sharp Rise in Cosmic Ray Irradiation of Organisms on Earth Caused by a Nearby SN Shockwave Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work considers the modelling of nearby supernova (SN) effects on Earth's biosphere via cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by shockwaves. The rise of the radiation background on Earth resulted from the external irradiation by CR high-energy particles and internal radiation in organisms by the decay of cosmogenic ${}^{14}$C is evaluated. We have taken into account that the CR flux near Earth goes up steeply when the shockwave crosses the Solar System, while in previous works the CR transport was considered as purely diffusive. Our simulations demonstrate a high rise of the external ionization of the environments at Earth's surface by atmospheric cascade particles that penetrate the first 70-100 m of water depth. Also, the cosmogenic ${}^{14}$C decay is able to irradiate the entire biosphere and deep ocean organisms. We analyzed the probable increase in mutation rate and estimated the distance between Earth and an SN, where the lethal effects of irradiation are possible. Our simulations demonstrate that for SN energy of around $10^{51}$ erg the lethal distance could be $\sim$ 18 pc.</description>

      <title>Misaligned Disk and Stellar Oblateness Driven Sculpting of Exoplanetary Systems: Origin of Perpendicular Orbits in HD 3167</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant proportion of exoplanets have been detected with highly tilted or even polar orbits relative to their host stars' equatorial planes. These unusual orbital configurations are often linked to post-disk secular interactions among multiple bodies. However, many aspects remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of disk-induced spin-orbit misalignments in shaping architecture of multi-planet systems, taking into account the combined effect of the host star's oblateness and the full-space disk potential. We demonstrate that large mutual planetary inclinations can arise from a saddle-center bifurcation occurring during the photoevaporation of the disk. This bifurcation triggers an instant, non-adiabatic transition in the planet's libration. Following this process, the orbital evolution diverges into several distinct patterns. Notably, in scenarios involving a near-polar primordial misalignment, the orbit, consistently librating about a coplanar equilibrium axis, can be captured by an orthogonal equilibrium during the decay of the stellar oblateness. However, the orbit will be eventually recaptured by the coplanar equilibrium, aligned or anti-aligned with the orientation of the outer orbit, resulting in either a prograde or retrograde inner-outer orbit configuration. Additionally, general relativity contributes to maintaining eccentricity stability within these dynamic scenarios. Through the proposed mechanism, we can provide a plausible explanation for the unique, near-perpendicular and likely retrograde orbit architecture observed in the HD 3167 system, enhancing our understanding of exoplanetary system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Influence of planets on debris discs in star clusters -- II. The impact of stellar density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of planetary systems in star clusters with different initial stellar densities, to investigate the impact of the density on debris disc dynamics. We use LPS+ to combine N-body codes NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND for simulations. We simulate debris discs with and without a Jupiter-mass planet at 50 au, in star clusters with N = 1k - 64k stars. The spatial range of the remaining planetary systems decreases with increasing N. As cluster density increases, the planet's influence range first increases and then decreases. For debris particles escaping from planetary systems, the probability of their direct ejection from the star cluster decreases as their initial semi-major axis (a0) or the cluster density increases. The eccentricity and inclination of surviving particles increase as cluster density increases. The presence of a planet leads to lower eccentricities and inclinations of surviving particles. The radial density distribution of the remaining discs decays exponentially in sparse clusters. We derive a general expression of the gravitational encounter rate. Our results are unable to directly explain the scarcity of debris discs in star clusters. Nevertheless, given that many planetary systems have multiple planets, the mechanism of the planet-cluster combined gravitational influence on the disc remains appealing as a potential explanation.</description>

      <title>Why heterogeneous cloud particles matter: Iron-bearing species and cloud particle morphology affects exoplanet transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of observing spectral features in exoplanet atmospheres with space missions like JWST and ARIEL necessitates the accurate modelling of cloud particle opacities. In exoplanet atmospheres, cloud particles can be made from multiple materials and be considerably chemically heterogeneous. Therefore, assumptions on the morphology of cloud particles are required to calculate their opacities. The aim of this work is to analyse how different approaches to calculate the opacities of heterogeneous cloud particles affect cloud particle optical properties. We calculate cloud particle optical properties using seven different mixing treatments: four effective medium theories (EMTs: Bruggeman, Landau-Lifshitz-Looyenga (LLL), Maxwell-Garnett, and Linear), core-shell, and two homogeneous cloud particle approximations. We study the mixing behaviour of 21 commonly considered cloud particle materials for exoplanets. To analyse the impact on observations, we study the transmission spectra of HATS-6b, WASP-39b, WASP-76b, and WASP-107b.Materials with large refractive indices, like iron-bearing species or carbon, can change the optical properties of cloud particles when they comprise less than 1\% of the total particle volume. The mixing treatment of heterogeneous cloud particles also has an observable effect on transmission spectroscopy. Assuming core-shell or homogeneous cloud particles results in less muting of molecular features and retains the cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials. The predicted transit depth for core-shell and homogeneous cloud particle materials are similar for all planets used in this work. If EMTs are used, cloud spectral features are broader and cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials are not retained. Using LLL leads to less molecular features in transmission spectra compared to Bruggeman.</description>

      <title>Twin Worlds, Divergent Fates: How Obliquity has differently shaped Pluto's and Triton's landscapes and climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triton and Pluto are believed to share a common origin, both forming initially in the Kuiper Belt but Triton being later captured by Neptune. Both objects display similar sizes, densities, and atmospheric and surface ice composition, with the presence of volatile ices N2, CH4 and CO. Yet their appearance, including their surface albedo and ice distribution strongly differ. What can explain these different appearances? A first disparity is that Triton is experiencing significant tidal heating due to its orbit around Neptune, with subsequent resurfacing and a relatively flat surface, while Pluto is not tidally activated and displays a pronounced topography. Here we present long-term volatile transport simulations of Pluto and Triton, using the same initial conditions and volatile inventory, but with the known orbit and rotation of each object. The model reproduces, to first order, the observed volatile ice surface distribution on Pluto and Triton. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that obliquity is the main driver of the differences in surface appearance and in climate properties on Pluto and Triton, and give further support to the hypothesis that both objects had a common origin followed by a different dynamical history.</description>

      <title>RedDots: Limits on habitable and undetected planets orbiting nearby stars GJ 832, GJ 674, and Ross 128</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Using HARPS spectroscopic data obtained by the RedDots campaign, as well as archival data from HARPS and CARMENES, supplemented with ASH2 and T90 photometry, we aim to search for additional planets around the three M dwarfs GJ 832, GJ 674, and Ross 128. We also aim to determine limits on possible undetected, habitable planets. We investigate (i) the reliability of the recovered orbital eccentricities and (ii) the reliability of Bayesian evidence as a diagnostic for selecting the best model.
  Methods. We employed Markov-chain Monte Carlo, nested sampling, and Gaussian process (GP) analyses to fit a total of 20 different models. We used the residuals to create grids for injection-recovery simulations to obtain detection limits on potentially undiscovered planets.
  Results. Our refined orbital elements for GJ 832 b, GJ 674 b, and Ross 128 b confirm (GJ 832, GJ 674) or increase (Ross 128) prior eccentricity determinations. No additional planets were found in any of the systems. The detection limits obtained for all three systems are between 30 and 50 cm/s for orbital periods in the range of 1 to 10 000 days. Using N-body simulations, we find that undiscovered secondary planets are unlikely (Ross 128) or incapable (GJ 674) of having caused the observed eccentricities of the known planets. We find that the eccentricity of GJ 832 b is not significantly different from zero.
  Conclusions. GJ 832 b, GJ 674 b, and Ross 128 b retain their status as hosting lonely and (for the latter two) eccentric planets. Finally, our results show that Bayesian evidence, when used in conjunction with GP, is not a robust diagnostic for selecting the best model in cases of low-activity stars. In such cases, we advise an inspection of the shapes of the posterior distributions and to ensure that relevant simulations are performed to assess the validity of the perceived best model.</description>

      <title>TOI-2379 b and TOI-2384 b: two super-Jupiter mass planets transiting low-mass host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period gas giant planets have been shown to be significantly rarer for host stars less massive than the Sun. We report the discovery of two transiting giant planets - TOI-2379 b and TOI-2384 b - with low-mass (early M) host stars. Both planets were detected using TESS photometry and for both the transit signal was validated using ground based photometric facilities. We confirm the planetary nature of these companions and measure their masses using radial velocity observations. We find that TOI-2379 b has an orbital period of 5.469 d and a mass and radius of $5.76\pm0.20$ M$_{J}$ and $1.046\pm0.023$ R$_{J}$ and TOI-2384 b has an orbital period of 2.136 d and a mass and radius of $1.966\pm0.059$ M$_{J}$ and $1.025\pm0.021$ R$_{J}$. TOI-2379 b and TOI-2384 b have the highest and third highest planet-to-star mass ratios respectively out of all transiting exoplanets with a low-mass host star, placing them uniquely among the population of known exoplanets and making them highly important pieces of the puzzle for understanding the extremes of giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-5688 A b, a low-density giant orbiting a high-metallicity early M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01371v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a low-density planet transiting TOI-5688 A b, a high-metallicity M2V star. This planet was discovered as part of the search for transiting giant planets ($R \gtrsim8$ M$_\oplus$) through the Searching for GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) survey. The planet TOI-5688 A b was discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and characterized with ground-based transits from Red Buttes Observatory (RBO), the Table Mountain Observatory of Pomona College, and radial velocity (RV) measurements with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF) on the 10 m Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET) and NEID on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. From the joint fit of transit and RV data, the mass of the planet is $124\pm24$ M$_\oplus$ and the radius is $10.4\pm0.7$ R$_\oplus$. This planet has a density of $0.61^{+0.20}_{-0.15}$ g/cm${}^3$, and is on a $\sim2.95$ day orbit around its host star. The spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the host star TOI-5688 A shows that it is a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $ = 0.47\pm0.16$ dex) M2V star, favoring the core-accretion formation pathway as the likely formation scenario for this planet. In this paper, we analyze potential mechanisms of planet formation in the context of the formation of TOI-5688 A b. Additionally, observations with Gaia suggest the presence of a wide-separation binary companion, TOI-5688 B, which has a projected separation of $\sim5"$ (1110 AU) and is an M4V. This makes TOI-5688 A b part of a growing number of GEMS in wide-separation binary systems.</description>

      <title>The time evolution of the ultraviolet habitable zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stars hosting Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) exoplanets, we investigate the time-evolution of their ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ), the annular region around a star where an exoplanet could experience a suitable ultraviolet environment for the presence and emergence of life, and the possible intersection of the UHZ with the CHZ. To estimate their UV luminosity evolution, and therefore the evolution of their UHZ, we analyse Swift-UV/Optical telescope observations and adopt the near-UV luminosity evolutionary tracks derived using GALEX observations of young moving groups. We find that an intersection between CHZ and UHZ could exist (or have existed) around all stars of our sample at different epochs, except for the coldest M-dwarfs (temperature &lt; 2800 K, e.g. Trappist-1). For hotter M-dwarfs the formation of RNA precursors through cyanosulfidic chemistry triggered by near-UV radiation could occur during the first 1-2 Gyrs. The radial-extension and time-duration of the CHZ-UHZ intersection increase with the stellar effective temperature and the exoplanet atmospheric transmissivity at near-UV wavelengths. Within our sample, Proxima Centauri represents a golden target for the quest of life outside the Solar system because it experienced a long-lasting and more extended, compared to similar M-dwarfs, CHZ-UHZ intersection.</description>

      <title>Impact of vegetation albedo on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vegetation can modify the planetary surface albedo via the Charney mechanism, as plants are usually darker than the bare surface of the continents. We updated ESTM (Earth-like Surface Temperature Model) to incorporate the presence, distribution and evolution of two dynamically competing vegetation types that resemble grasslands and trees (the latter in the double stages of life: adults and seedlings). The newly developed model was applied to estimate how the climate-vegetation system reaches equilibrium across different rocky planetary configurations, and to assess its impact on temperature and habitability. With respect to a world with bare granite continents, the effect of vegetation-albedo feedback is to increase the average surface temperature. Since grasses and trees exhibit different albedos, they affect temperature to different degrees. The ultimate impact on climate depends on the outcome of the competition between these vegetation types. The change in albedo due to vegetation extends the habitable zone and enhances the overall planetary habitability beyond its traditional outer edge. This effect is especially relevant for planets that have a larger extension of continents than Earth. For Earth, the semi-major axis d = 1.04 UA represents the turning point where vegetation enhances habitability from h = 0.0 to h = 0.485 (in the grass-dominance case), to h = 0.584 (in the case of coexistence between grasses and trees), and to h = 0.612 (in the tree-dominance case). This illustrates the transition from a snowball state to a planet with intermediate habitability at the outer edge of the circumstellar habitability zone.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LX Atmospheric characterisation of KELT-9 b via single-line analysis: Detection of six H I Balmer lines, Na I, Ca I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Ti II, Sc II, and Cr II</title>

Abstract: We analysed six primary transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9,b obtained with the HARPS-N high-resolution spectrograph in the context of the Global Architecture of Planetary Systems (GAPS2) project, to characterise the atmosphere via single-line analysis. We extracted the transmission spectrum of each individual line by comparing the master out-of-transit spectrum with the in-transit spectra and computing the weighted average of the tomography in the planet reference frame. We corrected for the centre-to-limb variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect by modelling the region of the star disc obscured by the planet during the transit and subtracting it from the master-out spectrum. We detected all six observable lines of the Balmer series within the HARPS-N wavelength range, from H$\alpha$ to H$\zeta$, with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$. We focussed on metal species, detecting Na I, Ca I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Ti II, Sc II, and Cr II lines. This is the first detection in the atmosphere of an exoplanet of H$\epsilon$ and H$\zeta$ lines, as well as of individual lines of Sc II and Cr II. Our detections are supported by a comparison with published synthetic transmission spectra of KELT-9b obtained accounting for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects. The results underline the presence of a systematic blueshift due to night-side to day-side winds. The single-line analysis allowed us not only to assess the presence of atomic species in the atmosphere of KELT-9 b, but also to further characterise the local stratification of the atmosphere. Coupling the height distribution of the detected species with the velocity shift retrieved, we acknowledged the height distribution of night-side to day-side winds. Moreover, the study of the rotational broadening of different species supports the prediction of a tidally locked planet rotating as a rigid body.</description>

      <title>ESCAPE project: investigating active observing strategies and post-processing methods for exoplanet high-contrast imaging with future space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for biosignatures in potentially habitable exoplanets is one of the major astrophysics' drivers for the coming decades, and the prime science goal of the HWO NASA mission, a large UV-Optical-IR space telescope to be launched in the 2040s. To reach this goal, it will be equipped with state-of-the-art high-contrast spectro-imaging capabilities enabling the detection of exoplanets 10^10 times fainter than their host stars, a formidable challenge given today's best detection limits at ~10^-6 contrast levels. This goal puts stringent constraints on the entire observatory, and demands the optimization at the system level to leverage the performance of individual sub-systems. However, while image processing techniques are a key asset to reach the ultimate performance, the science and technological definition of the mission concepts mostly rely on the coronagraph and wavefront control to reject the starlight, assuming a conservative gain of ~10 in sensitivity from image processing, extrapolated from performance obtained with classical techniques on Hubble observations. In the ESCAPE project, we investigate integrated solutions for optimizing the observing methods and data processing techniques with future space telescopes, making use of their wavefront sensors and deformable mirrors. The Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, will be a critical milestone to demonstrate key technologies ahead of HWO with the Coronagraph instrument, and is thus a unique opportunity to also test and validate innovative image processing techniques. Here we present the rational, methodology, and timeline of the ESCAPE project.</description>

      <title>Storms and convection on Uranus and Neptune: impact of methane abundance revealed by a 3D cloud-resolving model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune have atmospheres dominated by molecular hydrogen and helium. In the upper troposphere, methane is the third main molecule and condenses, yielding a vertical gradient in CH4. This condensable species being heavier than H2 and He, the resulting change in mean molecular weight due to condensation comes as a factor countering dry and moist convection. As observations also show latitudinal variations in methane abundance, one can expect different vertical gradients from one latitude to another. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this methane vertical gradient on the atmospheric regimes, especially on the formation and inhibition of moist convective storms in the troposphere of ice giants. We develop a 3D cloud-resolving model to simulate convective processes. Using our simulations, we conclude that typical velocities of dry convection in the deep atmosphere are rather low (of the order of 1 m/s) but sufficient to sustain upward methane transport, and that moist convection at methane condensation level is strongly inhibited. Previous studies derived an analytical criterion on the methane vapor amount above which moist convection should be inhibited. We first validate this analytical criterion numerically. We then show that the critical methane abundance governs the inhibition and formation of moist convective storms, and we conclude that the intensity and intermittency of these storms should depend on the methane abundance and saturation. In ice giants, dry convection is weak, and moist convection is strongly inhibited. However, when enough methane is transported upwards, through dry convection and turbulent diffusion, sporadic moist convective storms can form. These storms should be more frequent on Neptune than on Uranus, because of Neptune's internal heat flow. Our results can explain the observed sporadicity of clouds in ice giants.</description>

      <title>A broad set of solar and cosmochemical data indicates high C-N-O abundances for the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs (Barr &amp; Schawmb 2016, Bierson &amp; Nimmo 2019). This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem - an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new dataset from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new dataset. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere. I. Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE experiment onboard Chandayaan-3 lander</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chandra Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) is one of the payloads flown onboard the Chandrayaan-3 lander. The objective of the experiment is in-situ investigation of thermal behaviour of outermost 100 mm layer of the lunar surface by deploying a thermal probe. The probe consists of 10 temperature sensors (Platinum RTDs) mounted at different locations along the length of the probe to measure lunar soil temperatures as a function of depth. A heater is also mounted on the probe for thermal conductivity measurements. The onboard electronics of ChaSTE has two parts, Front-End Electronics (FEE) and processing electronics (PE). The front-end electronics (FEE) card is responsible for carrying out necessary sensor signal conditioning,which includes exciting the RTD sensors,acquiring analog voltages and then converting the acquired analog signals to digital signals using an Analog to Digital Converter(ADC). The front-end card is further interfaced with the processing electronics card for digital processing and spacecraft interface.The calibration, characterisation and functional test activities of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE were carried out with the objective of testing and ensuring proper functionality and performance.A two phase calibration process involving electronic offset correction and temperature calibration were carried out. All these activities were successfully completed and the results from them provided us with a really good understanding of the behaviour of the FEE under different thermal and electrical conditions as well as when subjected to the simulated conditions of the actual ChaSTE experiment. The performance of the ChaSTE front-end electronics was very much within the design margins and its behaviour in simulated lunar environment was as desired. The data from these activities is useful in the interpretation of the actual science data of ChaSTE.</description>

      <title>squishyplanet: Modeling Transits of Non-spherical Exoplanets in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While astronomers often assume that exoplanets are perfect spheres when analyzing observations, the subset of these distant worlds that are subject to strong tidal forces and/or rapid rotations are expected to be distinctly ellipsoidal or even triaxial. Since a planet's response to these forces is determined in part by its interior structure, measurements of an exoplanet's deviations from spherical symmetry can lead to powerful insights into its composition and surrounding environment. These shape deformations will imprint themselves on a planet's phase curve and transit lightcurve and cause small (1s-100s of parts per million) deviations from their spherical-planet counterparts. Until recently, these deviations were undetectable in typical real-world datasets due to limitations in photometric precision. Now, however, current and soon-to-come-online facilities such as JWST will routinely deliver observations that warrant the consideration of more complex models. To this end we present squishyplanet, a JAX-based Python package that implements an extension of the polynomial limb-darkened transit model presented in Agol et al. 2020 to non-spherical (triaxial) planets, as well as routines for modeling reflection and emission phase curves.</description>

      <title>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: A Comprehensive Spectroscopic Survey of Transiting &amp; High-Contrast Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a comprehensive survey of giant planets ranging from close-in highly irradiated hot Jupiters to young, wide-orbit directly imaged planets. The combination of two established techniques for probing planetary atmospheric compositions (time-series transit observations and high-contrast spectroscopy) will provide an unprecedented window into gaseous planet compositions across a range of equilibrium temperatures (100-2000 K), orbital separations (0.1-100 au), and system ages (10 Myr-1 Gyr). To-date, compositional measurements of both transiting and directly imaged planets suggest two distinct formation pathways: star-like formation for directly imaged planets and planet-like formation for transiting planets. By leveraging the combined technical and theoretical expertise of the transiting and direct imaging communities, we can obtain a holistic view of giant planet formation, migration, accretion, and evolution. From the results of this comprehensive program, we will begin to answer one of the fundamental outstanding questions in our understanding of giant planets: where and how in the protoplanetary disk do giant planets form?</description>

      <title>Review of the August 1972 and March 1989 Space Weather Events: Can We Learn Anything New From Them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updated summaries of the August 1972 and March 1989 space weather events have been constructed. The features of these two events are compared to the Carrington 1859 event and a few other major space weather events. It is concluded that solar active regions release energy in a variety of forms (X-rays, EUV photons, visible light, coronal mass ejection (CME) plasmas and fields) and they in turn can produce other energetic effects (solar energetic particles (SEPs), magnetic storms) in a variety of ways. It is clear that there is no strong one-to-one relationship between these various energy sinks. The energy is often distributed differently from one space weather event to the next. Concerning SEPs accelerated at interplanetary CME (ICME) shocks, it is concluded that the Fermi mechanism associated with quasi-parallel shocks is relatively weak and that the gradient drift mechanism (electric fields) at quasi-perpendicular shocks will produce harder spectra and higher fluxes. If the 4 Augusut 1972 intrinsic magnetic cloud condition (southward interplanetary magnetic field instead of northward) and the interplanetary Sun to 1 au conditions were different, a 4 August 1972 magnetic storm and magnetospheric dawn-to-dusk electric fields substantially larger than the Carrington event would have occurred. Under these special interplanetary conditions, a Miyake et al. (2012)-like extreme SEP event may have been formed. The long duration complex 1989 storm was probably greater than the Carrington storm in the sense that the total ring current particle energy was larger.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. LXI. Atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of TESS young exoplanet host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of exoplanets at different evolutionary stages can shed light on their formation, migration, and evolution. The determination of exoplanet properties depends on the properties of their host stars. It is therefore important to characterise the host stars for accurate knowledge on their planets. Our final goal is to derive, in a homogeneous and accurate way, the stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of ten young TESS transiting planet-hosting GK stars followed up with the HARPS-N at TNG spectrograph within the GAPS programme. We derived stellar kinematic properties, atmospheric parameters, and abundances of 18 elements. Lithium line measurements were used as approximate age estimations. We exploited chemical abundances and their ratios to derive information on planetary composition. Elemental abundances and kinematic properties are consistent with the nearby Galactic thin disk. All targets show C/O&lt;0.8 and 1.0&lt;Mg/Si&lt;1.5, compatible with silicate mantles made of a mixture of pyroxene and olivine assemblages. The Fe/Mg ratios, with values of $\sim$0.7-1.0, show a propensity for the planets to have big (iron) cores. All stars hosting very low-mass planets show Mg/Si values consistent with the Earth values, thus demonstrating their similar mantle composition. Hot Jupiter host stars show a lower content of O/Si, which could be related to the lower presence of water content. We confirm a trend found in the literature between stellar [O/Fe] and total planetary mass, implying an important role of the O in shaping the mass fraction of heavy elements in stars and their disks. The detailed host star abundances provided can be employed for further studies on the composition of the planets within the current sample, when their atmospheres will be exploited.</description>

      <title>On-chain Validation of Tracking Data Messages (TDM) Using Distributed Deep Learning on a Proof of Stake (PoS) Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustless tracking of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) is crucial for Space Situational Awareness (SSA), especially during adverse situations. The importance of transparent SSA cannot be overstated, as it is vital for ensuring space safety and security. In an era where RSO location information can be easily manipulated, the risk of RSOs being used as weapons is a growing concern. The Tracking Data Message (TDM) is a standardized format for broadcasting RSO observations. However, the varying quality of observations from diverse sensors poses challenges to SSA reliability. While many countries operate space assets, relatively few have SSA capabilities, making it crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Current practices assume complete trust in the transmitting party, leaving SSA capabilities vulnerable to adversarial actions such as spoofing TDMs. This work introduces a trustless mechanism for TDM validation and verification using deep learning over blockchain. By leveraging the trustless nature of blockchain, our approach eliminates the need for a central authority, establishing consensus-based truth. We propose a state-of-the-art, transformer-based orbit propagator that outperforms traditional methods like SGP4, enabling cross-validation of multiple observations for a single RSO. This deep learning-based transformer model can be distributed over a blockchain, allowing interested parties to host a node that contains a part of the distributed deep learning model. Our system comprises decentralised observers and validators within a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. Observers contribute TDM data along with a stake to ensure honesty, while validators run the propagation and validation algorithms. The system rewards observers for contributing verified TDMs and penalizes those submitting unverifiable data.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>Italian Spring Accelerometer measurements of unexpected Non Gravitational Perturbation during BepiColombo second Venus swing-by</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA) is a three axis mass-spring accelerometer, one of the payloads of the BepiColombo joint space mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). At launch in October 2018, BepiColombo started its seven-year cruise as a stack of three different modules, overall named Mercury Composite Spacecraft (MCS). The spacecraft will provide BepiColombo the necessary Delta V to reach Mercury with its electric thrusters and along with one, two and six gravity assists, respectively with Earth, Venus and Mercury. The accelerometer is accommodated on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) module and, jointly with the Ka-band Transponder (KaT) tracking data, will primarily serve the BepiColombo Radio Science Experiment (BC-RSE). During the second Venus swing-by, strong tidal effect and external perturbations was expected to act on the spacecraft and to become detectable by ISA. The swing-by had a closest approach of about 550 km and the gravity gradient expected on the IDA sensing elements was perfectly measured. Hence, in this paper, the first direct Gravity Gradient effect detection generated by an extraterrestrial body is shown. Nevertheless, around the closest approach, the measurements evidenced a spurious acceleration event lasting for several minutes. This work, exploiting information on the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) commanded torques, focuses and analyses this ISA acceleration signal, ascribing it to a net force really acting on the MCS spacecraft. Furthermore, using an estimation method, the application point of the force is confined to an area close to the MPO radiator.</description>

      <title>Unsigned magnetic flux proxy from solar optical intensity spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photospheric unsigned magnetic flux has been shown to be highly correlated with radial velocity (RV) variations caused by solar surface activity. This activity indicator is therefore a prime candidate to unlock the potential of RV surveys to discover Earth twins orbiting Sun-like stars. We show for the first time how a precise proxy of the unsigned magnetic flux ($\Delta\alpha B^2$) can be obtained from Sun-as-a-star intensity spectra by harnessing the magnetic information contained in over 4000 absorption lines in the wavelength range from 380 to 690 nm. This novel activity proxy can thus be obtained from the same spectra from which RVs are routinely extracted. We derived $\Delta\alpha B^2$ from 500 randomly selected spectra from the HARPS-N public solar data set, which spans from 2015 to 2018. We compared our estimates with the unsigned magnetic flux values from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) finding excellent agreement (median absolute deviation: 4.9 per cent). The extracted indicator $\Delta\alpha B^2$ correlates with SDO's unsigned magnetic flux estimates on the solar rotational timescale (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.67) and on the three-year timescale of our data set (correlation coefficient 0.91). We find correlations of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the HARPS-N solar RV variations of 0.49 on the rotational timescale and 0.78 on the three-year timescale. The Pearson correlation of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the RVs is found to be greater than the correlation of the classical activity indicators with the RVs. For solar-type stars, $\Delta\alpha B^2$ therefore represents the best simultaneous activity proxy known to date.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Small Ultra-short-period Planets Orbiting KG Dwarfs in Kepler Survey Using GPU Phase Folding and Deep Learning Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the first hot Jupiter orbiting a solar-type star, 51 Peg, in 1995, more than 4000 exoplanets have been identified using various observational techniques. The formation process of these sub-Earths remains elusive, and acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population. In our study, we employ a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional Neural Network, termed the GPFC method, on Kepler photometry data. This method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known KOI photometry data within hours using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five promising sub-Earth short-period candidates: K00446.c, K01821.b, K01522.c, K03404.b, and K04978.b. A closer analysis reveals the following characteristics: K00446.c orbits a K dwarf on a 0.645091-day period. With a radius of $0.461R_\oplus$, it ranks as the second smallest USP discovered to date. K01821.b is a sub-Earth with a radius of $0.648R_\oplus$, orbiting a G dwarf over a 0.91978-day period. It is the second smallest USP among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the NASA Archive. K01522.c has a radius of $0.704 R_\oplus$ and completes an orbit around a Sun-like G dwarf in 0.64672 days; K03404.b, with a radius of $0.738 R_\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf on a 0.68074-day period; and K04978.b, with its planetary radius of $0.912 R_\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf, completing an orbit every 0.94197 days. Three of our finds, K01821.b, K01522.c and K03404.b, rank as the smallest planets among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the Kepler dataset. The discovery of these small exoplanets underscores the promising capability of the GPFC method for searching for small, new transiting exoplanets in photometry data from Kepler, TESS, and future space transit missions.</description>

      <title>Early stages of gap opening by planets in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annular substructures in protoplanetary discs, ubiquitous in sub-mm observations, can be caused by gravitational coupling between a disc and its embedded planets. Planetary density waves inject angular momentum into the disc leading to gap opening only after travelling some distance and steepening into shocks (in the absence of linear damping); no angular momentum is deposited in the planetary coorbital region, where the wave has not shocked yet. Despite that, simulations show mass evacuation from the coorbital region even in inviscid discs, leading to smooth, double-trough gap profiles. Here we consider the early, time-dependent stages of planetary gap opening in inviscid discs. We find that an often-overlooked contribution to the angular momentum balance caused by the time-variability of the specific angular momentum of the disc fluid (caused, in turn, by the time-variability of the radial pressure support) plays a key role in gap opening. Focusing on the regime of shallow gaps with depths of $\lesssim 20\%$, we demonstrate analytically that early gap opening is a self-similar process, with the amplitude of the planet-driven perturbation growing linearly in time and the radial gap profile that can be computed semi-analytically. We show that mass indeed gets evacuated from the coorbital region even in inviscid discs. This evolution pattern holds even in viscous discs over a limited period of time. These results are found to be in excellent agreement with 2D numerical simulations. Our simple gap evolution solutions can be used in studies of dust dynamics near planets and for interpreting protoplanetary disc observations.</description>

      <title>Physics simulation capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged abstract] Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some undergraduate-level to graduate-level physics textbook problems and are proficient at coding. Combining these two capabilities could one day enable AI systems to simulate and predict the physical world.
  We present an evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on PhD-level to research-level computational physics problems. We condition LLM generation on the use of well-documented and widely-used packages to elicit coding capabilities in the physics and astrophysics domains. We contribute $\sim 50$ original and challenging problems in celestial mechanics (with REBOUND), stellar physics (with MESA), 1D fluid dynamics (with Dedalus) and non-linear dynamics (with SciPy). Since our problems do not admit unique solutions, we evaluate LLM performance on several soft metrics: counts of lines that contain different types of errors (coding, physics, necessity and sufficiency) as well as a more "educational" Pass-Fail metric focused on capturing the salient physical ingredients of the problem at hand.
  As expected, today's SOTA LLM (GPT4) zero-shot fails most of our problems, although about 40\% of the solutions could plausibly get a passing grade. About $70-90 \%$ of the code lines produced are necessary, sufficient and correct (coding \&amp; physics). Physics and coding errors are the most common, with some unnecessary or insufficient lines. We observe significant variations across problem class and difficulty. We identify several failure modes of GPT4 in the computational physics domain.
  Our reconnaissance work provides a snapshot of current computational capabilities in classical physics and points to obvious improvement targets if AI systems are ever to reach a basic level of autonomy in physics simulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the potential origin of the circumbinary planet Delorme 1 (AB)b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.</description>
