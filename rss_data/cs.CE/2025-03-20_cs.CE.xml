      <title>AI Work Quantization Model: Closed-System AI Computational Effort Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI-driven automation in IoT environments, particularly in smart cities and industrial systems, necessitates a standardized approach to quantify AIs computational workload. Existing methodologies lack a consistent framework for measuring AI computational effort across diverse architectures, posing challenges in fair taxation models and energy-aware workload assessments. This study introduces the Closed-System AI Computational Effort Metric, a theoretical framework that quantifies real-time computational effort by incorporating input/output complexity, execution dynamics, and hardware-specific performance factors. The model ensures comparability between AI workloads across traditional CPUs and modern GPU/TPU accelerators, facilitating standardized performance evaluations. Additionally, we propose an energy-aware extension to assess AIs environmental impact, enabling sustainability-focused AI optimizations and equitable taxation models. Our findings establish a direct correlation between AI workload and human productivity, where 5 AI Workload Units equate to approximately 60 to 72 hours of human labor, exceeding a full-time workweek. By systematically linking AI computational effort to human labor, this framework enhances the understanding of AIs role in workforce automation, industrial efficiency, and sustainable computing. Future work will focus on refining the model through dynamic workload adaptation, complexity normalization, and energy-aware AI cost estimation, further broadening its applicability in diverse AI-driven ecosystems.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Rapid Identification of Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens in Blood Smears of Septic Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacteria species and 3 yeast-like fungi from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of positive blood samples from sepsis patients.
  A total of 16,637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. The analysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Nakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due to high morphotic diversity.
  The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification, but it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the training data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial diagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis treatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results presented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the European Patent Office EP24461637.1 "A computer implemented method for identifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor".</description>

      <title>Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Perform Rapid, Resolution-Invariant Grain Growth Modeling via Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input-output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.</description>

      <title>Design for Sensing and Digitalisation (DSD): A Modern Approach to Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Design for Sensing and Digitalisation (DSD), a new engineering design paradigm that integrates sensor technology for digitisation and digitalisation from the earliest stages of the design process. Unlike traditional methodologies that treat sensing as an afterthought, DSD emphasises sensor integration, signal path optimisation, and real-time data utilisation as core design principles. The paper outlines DSD's key principles, discusses its role in enabling digital twin technology, and argues for its importance in modern engineering education. By adopting DSD, engineers can create more intelligent and adaptable systems that leverage real-time data for continuous design iteration, operational optimisation and data-driven predictive maintenance.</description>

      <title>Context Clues: Evaluating Long Context Models for Clinical Prediction Tasks on EHRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks. However, most existing EHR FMs have context windows of &lt;1k tokens. This prevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events. Recent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g., Mamba) offer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been well-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation of the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer context models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction benchmark. For clinical applications, however, model performance alone is insufficient -- robustness to the unique properties of EHR is crucial. Thus, we also evaluate models across three previously underexplored properties of EHR data: (1) the prevalence of "copy-forwarded" diagnoses which creates artificial repetition of tokens within EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals between EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context window; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which makes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying our EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate negatively with model performance, but that longer context models are more robust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the potential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a case study for identifying new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated by domains outside of natural language. We release our models and code at: https://github.com/som-shahlab/long_context_clues</description>
