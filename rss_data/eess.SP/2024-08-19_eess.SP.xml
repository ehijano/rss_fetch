      <title>Movable-Antenna Position Optimization for Physical-Layer Security via Discrete Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and mobile antennas (MAs) are innovative technologies in wireless communications that are able to proactively improve channel conditions by dynamically adjusting the transmit/receive antenna positions within a given spatial region. In this paper, we investigate an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) secure communication system, aiming to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the positions of multiple MAs. Instead of continuously searching for the optimal MA positions as in prior works, we propose to discretize the transmit region into multiple sampling points, thereby converting the continuous antenna position optimization into a discrete sampling point selection problem. However, this point selection problem is combinatory and thus difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this challenge, we ingeniously transform this combinatory problem into a recursive path selection problem in graph theory and propose a partial enumeration algorithm to obtain its optimal solution without the need for high-complexity exhaustive search. To further reduce the complexity, a linear-time sequential update algorithm is also proposed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms yield much higher secrecy rates as compared to the conventional FPA and other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Deep multi-intentional inverse reinforcement learning for cognitive multi-function radar inverse cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, radar systems have advanced significantly, offering environmental adaptation and multi-task capabilities. These developments pose new challenges for electronic intelligence (Elint) and electronic support measures (ESM), which need to identify and interpret sophisticated radar behaviors. This paper introduces a Deep Multi-Intentional Inverse Reinforcement Learning (DMIIRL) method for the identification and inverse cognition of cognitive multi-function radars (CMFR). Traditional Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods primarily target single reward functions, but the complexity of CMFRs necessitates multiple reward functions to fully encapsulate their behavior. To this end, we develop a method that integrates IRL with Expectation-Maximization (EM) to concurrently handle multiple reward functions, offering better trajectory clustering and reward function estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized code index modulation-aided frequency offset realign multiple-antenna spatial modulation approach for next-generation green communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For next-generation green communication systems, this article proposes an innovative communication system based on frequency-diverse array-multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) technology, which aims to achieve high data rates while maintaining low power consumption. This system utilizes frequency offset index realign modulation, multiple-antenna spatial index modulation, and spreading code index modulation techniques. In the proposed generalized code index modulation-aided frequency offset realign multiple-antenna spatial modulation (GCIM-FORMASM) system, the coming bits are divided into five parts: spatial modulation bits by activating multiple transmit antennas, frequency offset index bits of the FDA antennas, including frequency offset combination bits and frequency offset realign bits, spreading code index modulation bits, and modulated symbol bits. Subsequently, this paper utilizes the orthogonal waveforms transmitted by the FDA to design the corresponding transmitter and receiver structures and provide specific expressions for the received signals. Meanwhile, to reduce the decoding complexity of the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, we propose a three-stage despreading-based low complexity (DBLC) algorithm leveraging the orthogonality of the spreading codes. Additionally, a closed-form expression for the upper bound of the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the DBLC algorithm has been derived. Analyzing metrics such as energy efficiency and data rate shows that the proposed system features low power consumption and high data transmission rates, which aligns better with the concept of future green communications. The effectiveness of our proposed methods has been validated through comprehensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>Fast Network Recovery from Large-Scale Disasters: A Resilient and Self-Organizing RAN Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme natural phenomena are occurring more frequently everyday in the world, challenging, among others, the infrastructure of communication networks. For instance, the devastating earthquakes in Turkiye in early 2023 showcased that, although communications became an imminent priority, existing mobile communication systems fell short with the operational requirements of harsh disaster environments. In this article, we present a novel framework for robust, resilient, adaptive, and open source sixth generation (6G) radio access networks (Open6GRAN) that can provide uninterrupted communication services in the face of natural disasters and other disruptions. Advanced 6G technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), cell-free multiple-input-multiple-output, and joint communications and sensing with increasingly heterogeneous deployment, consisting of terrestrial and non-terrestrial nodes, are robustly integrated. We advocate that a key enabler to develop service and management orchestration with fast recovery capabilities will rely on an artificial-intelligence-based radio access network (RAN) controller. To support the emergency use case spanning a larger area, the integration of aerial and space segments with the terrestrial network promises a rapid and reliable response in the case of any disaster. A proof-of-concept that rapidly reconfigures an RIS for performance enhancement under an emergency scenario is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Precoding Under Realistic Satellite Communications Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, optimal linear precoding for the multibeam geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite with the multi-user (MU) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink scenario is addressed. Multiple-user interference is one of the major issues faced by the satellites serving the multiple users operating at the common time-frequency resource block in the downlink channel. To mitigate this issue, the optimal linear precoders are implemented at the gateways (GWs). The precoding computation is performed by utilizing the channel state information obtained at user terminals (UTs). The optimal linear precoders are derived considering beamformer update and power control with an iterative per-antenna power optimization algorithm with a limited required number of iterations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using the In-Lab experiment for 16X16 precoding with multi-beam satellite for transmitting and receiving the precoded data with digital video broadcasting satellite-second generation extension (DVB- S2X) standard for the GW and the UTs. The software defined radio platforms are employed for emulating the GWs, UTs, and satellite links. The validation is supported by comparing the proposed optimal linear precoder with full frequency reuse (FFR), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that with the optimal linear precoders it is possible to successfully cancel the inter-user interference in the simulated satellite FFR link. Thus, optimal linear precoding brings gains in terms of enhanced signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio, and increased system throughput and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Intra-symbol Differential Amplitude Shift Keying-aided Blind Detector for Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are a promising technology for addressing the energy consumption challenge in wireless communications through the reflection or absorption of surrounding radio frequency (RF) signals. However, it grapples with the intricacies of ambient RF signal and the round-trip path loss. For traditional detectors, the incorporation of pilot sequences results in a reduction in spectral efficiency. Furthermore, traditional energy-based detectors are inherently susceptible to a notable error floor issue, attributed to the co-channel direct link interference (DLI). Consequently, this paper proposes a blind symbol detector without the prior knowledge of the channel state information, signal variance, and noise variance. By leveraging the intra-symbol differential amplitude shift keying (IDASK) scheme, this detector effectively redirects the majority of the DLI energy towards the largest eigenvalue of the received sample covariance matrix, thereby utilizing the second largest eigenvalue for efficient symbol detection. In addition, this paper conducts theoretical performance analyses of the proposed detector in terms of the false alarm probability, missed detection probability, and the bit-error rate (BER) lower bound. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed blind detector exhibits a significant enhancement in symbol detection performance compared to its traditional counterparts.</description>

      <title>ECG-Chat: A Large ECG-Language Model for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the medical auxiliary field shows great potential, allowing patients to engage in conversations using physiological signal data. However, general MLLMs perform poorly in cardiac disease diagnosis, particularly in the integration of ECG data analysis and long-text medical report generation, mainly due to the complexity of ECG data analysis and the gap between text and ECG signal modalities. Additionally, models often exhibit severe stability deficiencies in long-text generation due to the lack of precise knowledge strongly related to user queries. To address these issues, we propose ECG-Chat, the first multitask MLLMs focused on ECG medical report generation, providing multimodal conversational capabilities based on cardiology knowledge. We propose a contrastive learning approach that integrates ECG waveform data with text reports, aligning ECG features with reports in a fine-grained manner. This method also results in an ECG encoder that excels in zero-shot report retrieval tasks. Additionally, expanding existing datasets, we constructed a 19k ECG diagnosis dataset and a 25k multi-turn dialogue dataset for training and fine-tuning ECG-Chat, which provides professional diagnostic and conversational capabilities. Furthermore, ECG-Chat can generate comprehensive ECG analysis reports through an automated LaTeX generation pipeline. We established a benchmark for the ECG report generation task and tested our model on multiple baselines. ECG-Chat achieved the best performance in classification, retrieval, multimodal dialogue, and medical report generation tasks. Our report template design has also been widely recognized by medical practitioners.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Contrastive Learning Based Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data mining is immensely important in extensive applications, such as traffic, medical, and e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are typically powered by small-sized batteries with limited energy storage capacity, requiring regular replacement or recharging. To reduce costs and maintain connectivity in IoT networks, energy harvesting technologies are regarded as a promising solution. Notably, due to its robust analytical and generative capabilities, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has demonstrated significant potential in optimizing energy harvesting networks. Therefore, we discuss key applications of GenAI in improving energy harvesting wireless networks for IoT in this article. Specifically, we first review the key technologies of GenAI and the architecture of energy harvesting wireless networks. Then, we show how GenAI can address different problems to improve the performance of the energy harvesting wireless networks. Subsequently, we present a case study of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled data collection and energy transfer. The case study shows distinctively the necessity of energy harvesting technology and verify the effectiveness of GenAI-based methods. Finally, we discuss some important open directions.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna for Wireless Communications:Prototyping and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA), which can flexibly change the position of antenna in three-dimensional (3D) continuous space, is an emerging technology for achieving full spatial performance gains. In this paper, a prototype of MA communication system with ultra-accurate movement control is presented to verify the performance gain of MA in practical environments. The prototype utilizes the feedback control to ensure that each power measurement is performed after the MA moves to a designated position. The system operates at 3.5 GHz or 27.5 GHz, where the MA moves along a one-dimensional horizontal line with a step size of 0.01{\lambda} and in a two-dimensional square region with a step size of 0.05{\lambda}, respectively, with {\lambda} denoting the signal wavelength. The scenario with mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) links is considered. Extensive experimental results are obtained with the designed prototype and compared with the simulation results, which validate the great potential of MA technology in improving wireless communication performance. For example, the maximum variation of measured power reaches over 40 dB and 23 dB at 3.5 GHz and 27.5 GHz, respectively, thanks to the flexible antenna movement. In addition, experimental results indicate that the power gain of MA system relies on the estimated path state information (PSI), including the number of paths, their delays, elevation and azimuth angles of arrival (AoAs), as well as the power ratio of each path.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Iteratively Linear Detectors in Multi-User (ELAA-)MIMO Systems with UW-SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current iterative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors suffer from slow convergence when the wireless channel is ill-conditioned. The ill-conditioning is mainly caused by spatial correlation between channel columns corresponding to the same user equipment, known as intra-user interference. In addition, in the emerging MIMO systems using an extremely large aperture array (ELAA), spatial non-stationarity can make the channel even more ill-conditioned. In this paper, user-wise singular value decomposition (UW-SVD) is proposed to accelerate the convergence of iterative MIMO detectors. Its basic principle is to perform SVD on each user's sub-channel matrix to eliminate intra-user interference. Then, the MIMO signal model is effectively transformed into an equivalent signal (e-signal) model, comprising an e-channel matrix and an e-signal vector. Existing iterative algorithms can be used to recover the e-signal vector, which undergoes post-processing to obtain the signal vector. It is proven that the e-channel matrix is better conditioned than the original MIMO channel for spatially correlated (ELAA-)MIMO channels. This implies that UW-SVD can accelerate current iterative algorithms, which is confirmed by our simulation results. Specifically, it can speed up convergence by up to 10 times in both uncoded and coded systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Broadband Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter communication offers a promising solution to connect massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with low cost and high energy efficiency. Nevertheless, its inherently passive nature limits transmission reliability, thereby hindering improvements in communication range and data rate. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a bistatic broadband backscatter communication (BBBC) system, which equips the backscatter device (BD) with multiple antennas. In the proposed BBBC system, a radio frequency (RF) source directs a sinusoidal signal to the BD, facilitating single-carrier block transmission at the BD. Meanwhile, without requiring channel state information (CSI), cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is employed at the multi-antenna BD to enhance transmission reliability through additional cyclically delayed backscattered signals. We also propose a receiver design that includes preprocessing of the time-domain received signal, pilot-based parameter estimation, and frequency-domain equalization, enabling low-complexity detection of the backscattered signal. Leveraging the matched filter bound (MFB), we analyze the achievable diversity gains in terms of outage probability. Our analysis reveals that spatial diversity is achievable under general Rayleigh fading conditions, and both frequency and spatial diversity are attainable in scenarios where the forward link experiences a line-of-sight (LoS) channel. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed BBBC system. As the number of BD antennas increases, our results show that the proposed scheme not only enhances array gain but also improves diversity order, significantly reducing both outage probability and bit error rate (BER). Consequently, it outperforms conventional schemes that yield only minor gains.</description>

      <title>A Novel Unsupervised Graph Wavelet Autoencoder for Mechanical System Fault Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable fault detection is an essential requirement for safe and efficient operation of complex mechanical systems in various industrial applications. Despite the abundance of existing approaches and the maturity of the fault detection research field, the interdependencies between condition monitoring data have often been overlooked. Recently, graph neural networks have been proposed as a solution for learning the interdependencies among data, and the graph autoencoder (GAE) architecture, similar to standard autoencoders, has gained widespread use in fault detection. However, both the GAE and the graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) have fixed receptive fields, limiting their ability to extract multiscale features and model performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose two graph neural network models: the graph wavelet autoencoder (GWAE), and the graph wavelet variational autoencoder (GWVAE). GWAE consists mainly of the spectral graph wavelet convolutional (SGWConv) encoder and a feature decoder, while GWVAE is the variational form of GWAE. The developed SGWConv is built upon the spectral graph wavelet transform which can realize multiscale feature extraction by decomposing the graph signal into one scaling function coefficient and several spectral graph wavelet coefficients. To achieve unsupervised mechanical system fault detection, we transform the collected system signals into PathGraph by considering the neighboring relationships of each data sample. Fault detection is then achieved by evaluating the reconstruction errors of normal and abnormal samples. We carried out experiments on two condition monitoring datasets collected from fuel control systems and one acoustic monitoring dataset from a valve. The results show that the proposed methods improve the performance by around 3%~4% compared to the comparison methods.</description>

      <title>Multistatic-Radar RCS-Signature Recognition of Aerial Vehicles: A Bayesian Fusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, crucial for defense and aerospace applications. Previous studies highlighted the advantages of multistatic radar configurations over monostatic ones in RATR. However, fusion methods in multistatic radar configurations often suboptimally combine classification vectors from individual radars probabilistically. To address this, we propose a fully Bayesian RATR framework employing Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) to aggregate classification probability vectors from multiple radars. OBF, based on expected 0-1 loss, updates a Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution for target UAV type, conditioned on historical observations across multiple time steps. We evaluate the approach using simulated random walk trajectories for seven drones, correlating target aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber. Comparing against single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) systems and suboptimal fusion methods, our empirical results demonstrate that the OBF method integrated with RBC significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to other fusion methods and single radar configurations.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>Resilience in Online Federated Learning: Mitigating Model-Poisoning Attacks via Partial Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows training machine learning models on distributed data without compromising privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to model-poisoning attacks where malicious clients tamper with their local models to manipulate the global model. In this work, we investigate the resilience of the partial-sharing online FL (PSO-Fed) algorithm against such attacks. PSO-Fed reduces communication overhead by allowing clients to share only a fraction of their model updates with the server. We demonstrate that this partial sharing mechanism has the added advantage of enhancing PSO-Fed's robustness to model-poisoning attacks. Through theoretical analysis, we show that PSO-Fed maintains convergence even under Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients inject noise into their updates. Furthermore, we derive a formula for PSO-Fed's mean square error, considering factors like stepsize, attack probability, and the number of malicious clients. Interestingly, we find a non-trivial optimal stepsize that maximizes PSO-Fed's resistance to these attacks. Extensive numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and showcase PSO-Fed's superior performance against model-poisoning attacks compared to other leading FL algorithms.</description>
