      <title>Inflation Target at Risk: A Time-varying Parameter Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macro variables frequently display time-varying distributions, driven by the dynamic and evolving characteristics of economic, social, and environmental factors that consistently reshape the fundamental patterns and relationships governing these variables. To better understand the distributional dynamics beyond the central tendency, this paper introduces a novel semi-parametric approach for constructing time-varying conditional distributions, relying on the recent advances in distributional regression. We present an efficient precision-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that simultaneously estimates all model parameters while explicitly enforcing the monotonicity condition on the conditional distribution function. Our model is applied to construct the forecasting distribution of inflation for the U.S., conditional on a set of macroeconomic and financial indicators. The risks of future inflation deviating excessively high or low from the desired range are carefully evaluated. Moreover, we provide a thorough discussion about the interplay between inflation and unemployment rates during the Global Financial Crisis, COVID, and the third quarter of 2023.</description>

      <title>Composite likelihood estimation of stationary Gaussian processes with a view toward stochastic volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for composite likelihood inference of parametric continuous-time stationary Gaussian processes. We derive the asymptotic theory of the associated maximum composite likelihood estimator. We implement our approach on a pair of models that has been proposed to describe the random log-spot variance of financial asset returns. A simulation study shows that it delivers good performance in these settings and improves upon a method-of-moments estimation. In an application, we inspect the dynamic of an intraday measure of spot variance computed with high-frequency data from the cryptocurrency market. The empirical evidence supports a mechanism, where the short- and long-term correlation structure of stochastic volatility are decoupled in order to capture its properties at different time scales.</description>

      <title>Robustify and Tighten the Lee Bounds: A Sample Selection Model under Stochastic Monotonicity and Symmetry Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of sample selection, Lee's (2009) nonparametric bounds are a popular tool for estimating a treatment effect. However, the Lee bounds rely on the monotonicity assumption, whose empirical validity is sometimes unclear. Furthermore, the bounds are often regarded to be wide and less informative even under monotonicity. To address these issues, this study introduces a stochastic version of the monotonicity assumption alongside a nonparametric distributional shape constraint. The former enhances the robustness of the Lee bounds with respect to monotonicity, while the latter helps tighten these bounds. The obtained bounds do not rely on the exclusion restriction and can be root-$n$ consistently estimable, making them practically viable. The potential usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated by their application on experimental data from the after-school instruction programme studied by Muralidharan, Singh, and Ganimian (2019).</description>
