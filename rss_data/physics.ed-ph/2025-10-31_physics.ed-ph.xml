      <title>Ensuring Outcome-Based Curriculum Coherence through Systematic CLO-PLO Alignment and Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a quantitative framework to enhance curriculum coherence through the systematic alignment of Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), contributing to continuous improvement in outcome-based education. Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.</description>

      <title>Industry Members' Perceptions about ABET-based Accreditation: An Exploratory Study in a Developing Country</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABET accreditation is an increasingly prominent system of global accreditation of engineering programs, and the assessment requires programs to demonstrate that they meet the needs of the program's stakeholders, typically industrial potential employers of graduates. To obtain these inputs, programs are required to assemble an advisory committee board. The views of the advisory board on the relevance of the degree outcomes are an essential part of this process. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore the viewpoints that industry stakeholders have on this type of process. The context for the study was an Ecuadorian engineering program which had successfully achieved the ABET accreditation. The study drew on interviews undertaken with industry members who were part of the advisory board. This study focuses on how they perceive the process and the accreditation awarded, analyzing their views of its usefulness, especially in relation to the employability of graduates. Based on the findings, we offer critical insights into this accreditation process when it takes place in contexts beyond highly industrialized countries.</description>

      <title>Development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality simulator for HDR prostate brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a virtual reality simulator for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy and to test whether participation is associated with immediate gains in self-reported confidence across predefined procedural domains in two cohorts. Methods: Two modules were developed and implemented using Unreal Engine: patient preparation and template guided needle insertion. Oncology staff and trainees completed pre and post surveys that assessed confidence for recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining equipment function. Studies were conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy Workshop (HOWBT) in London, Ontario, and at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p values compared before and after scores within each module. Results: Patient preparation (N=11) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002), explaining steps (W=51, p = 0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). Needle insertion (N=27) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=292, p&lt;0.001), explaining steps (W=347, p&lt;0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p&lt;0.001), and explaining equipment function (W=354, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The simulator was feasible to deploy and was associated with higher self-reported confidence across key domains immediately after training. Findings may inform future curriculum design and implementation work.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spectroscopy Using Diffraction Grating, CMOS Monochrome Sensor, and Reflecting Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a compact, low-cost stellar spectrometer developed for undergraduate and outreach applications. The instrument employs a 600 lines/mm diffraction grating, a CMOS monochrome sensor, and a 3D-printed mount integrated with reflecting telescopes. Calibration was performed using helium emission sources in the laboratory and Vega as a spectrophotometric standard, supported by a custom Python-based image-processing pipeline for wavelength calibration and spectral stacking. The spectrometer successfully recorded usable spectra of bright stars including Vega, Sirius, Procyon, Capella, and Betelgeuse, covering spectral types A through M. The results demonstrate that meaningful stellar spectroscopy can be achieved with accessible, low-cost equipment, providing a practical framework for student-led astronomical instrumentation projects.</description>
