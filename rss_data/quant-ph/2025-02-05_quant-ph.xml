      <title>Quantum Internet: Technologies, Protocols, and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of the quantum internet advances, the necessity for a comprehensive guide to navigate its complexities has become increasingly crucial. Quantum computing, a more established relative, shares foundational principles with the quantum internet; however, distinguishing between the two is essential for further development and deeper understanding. This work systematically introduces the quantum internet by addressing fundamental questions: Why is it important? What are its core components? How does it function? When will it be viable? Who are the key players? What are the challenges and future directions? Through elucidating these aspects along with a comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts, we aim to provide a clear and accessible overview of the quantum internet, facilitating the groundwork for future innovations and research in the field.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Observation Cost Control for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective to be minimized in the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has a restricted form, which allows a specialized sequential minimal optimization (SMO) that requires only a few observations in each iteration. However, the SMO iteration is still costly due to the observation noise -- one observation at a point typically requires averaging over hundreds to thousands of repeated quantum measurement shots for achieving a reasonable noise level. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cost control method, named subspace in confident region (SubsCoRe), for SMO. SubsCoRe uses the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate, and requires it to have low uncertainty over the subspace being updated, so that optimization in each iteration is performed with guaranteed accuracy. The adaptive cost control is performed by first setting the required accuracy according to the progress of the optimization, and then choosing the minimum number of measurement shots and their distribution such that the required accuracy is satisfied. We demonstrate that SubsCoRe significantly improves the efficiency of SMO, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Reducing the sampling complexity of energy estimation in quantum many-body systems using empirical variance information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the energy of a quantum state preparation for a given Hamiltonian in Pauli decomposition. For various quantum algorithms, in particular in the context of quantum chemistry, it is crucial to have energy estimates with error bounds, as captured by guarantees on the problem's sampling complexity. In particular, when limited to Pauli basis measurements, the smallest sampling complexity guarantee comes from a simple single-shot estimator via a straightforward argument based on Hoeffding's inequality.
  In this work, we construct an adaptive estimator using the state's actual variance. Technically, our estimation method is based on the Empirical Bernstein stopping (EBS) algorithm and grouping schemes, and we provide a rigorous tail bound, which leverages the state's empirical variance. In a numerical benchmark of estimating ground-state energies of several Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that EBS consistently improves upon elementary readout guarantees up to one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free experimental observation of the measurement-induced phase transition in circuits with universal gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling and disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made on the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a prominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is particularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a number of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of measurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the postselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that infers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of this classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size unless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In this work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum circuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak measurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can be detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding process whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol exploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a complete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for its critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental results are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between analytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.</description>

      <title>Operator-basis Matrix Product State formalism for optical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network formalisms have emerged as powerful tools for simulating quantum state evolution. While widely applied in the study of optical quantum circuits, such as Boson Sampling, existing tensor network approaches fail to address the complexity mismatch between tensor contractions and the calculation of photon-counting probability amplitudes. Here, we present an alternative tensor network framework, the operator-basis Matrix Product State (MPS), which exploits the input-output relations of quantum optical circuits encoded in the unitary interferometer matrix. Our approach bridges the complexity gap by enabling the computation of the permanent -- central to Boson Sampling -- with the same computational complexity as the best known classical algorithm based on a graphical representation of the operator-basis MPS that we introduce. Furthermore, we exploit the flexibility of tensor networks to extend our formalism to incorporate partial distinguishability and photon loss, two key imperfections in practical interferometry experiments. This work offers a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale quantum optical systems and the understanding of their computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $\text{H}_{XY}$ gate on the 2d triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce a new cultivation protocol that avoids grafting, by exploiting the transversality of the controlled-X (CX) operation on all CSS codes. Our protocol projects a pairs of low distance surface codes into a magic CX-eigenstate, and expands them to larger surface codes after post-selection. The effect of erasure qubits on both types of cultivation is analyzed, showing how it can be used to further reduce the logical error rate of cultivation. Importantly, CX cultivation uses non-local connectivity, and benefits from platforms with native Toffoli gates ($\text{CCX}$), both of which were recently demonstrated with Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann's theorem for relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem states that, for any two quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ and $\sigma_A$, there exists an extension $\sigma_{AB}$ of $\sigma_A$ such that the fidelity between $\rho_{AB}$ and $\sigma_{AB}$ equals the fidelity between their reduced states $\rho_A$ and $\sigma_A$. In this work, we generalize Uhlmann's theorem to $\alpha$-R\'enyi relative entropies for $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$, a family of divergences that encompasses fidelity, relative entropy, and max-relative entropy corresponding to $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$, $\alpha=1$, and $\alpha=\infty$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced solid-state nuclear spin gyroscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum sensors based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful tools for precise sensing applications. Nuclear spin sensors are particularly well-suited for applications requiring long coherence times, such as inertial sensing, but remain underexplored due to control complexity and limited optical readout efficiency. In this work, we propose cooperative cavity quantum electrodynamic (cQED) coupling to achieve efficient nuclear spin readout. Unlike previous cQED methods used to enhance electron spin readout, here we employ two-field interference in the NV hyperfine subspace to directly probe the nuclear spin transitions. We model the nuclear spin NV-cQED system (nNV-cQED) and observe several distinct regimes, including electromagnetically induced transparency, masing without inversion, and oscillatory behavior. We then evaluate the nNV-cQED system as an inertial sensor, indicating a rotation sensitivity improved by three orders of magnitude compared to previous solid-state spin demonstrations. Furthermore, we show that the NV electron spin can be simultaneously used as a comagnetometer, and the four crystallographic axes of NVs can be employed for vector resolution in a single nNV-cQED system. These results showcase the applications of two-field interference using the nNV-cQED platform, providing critical insights into the manipulation and control of quantum states in hybrid NV systems and unlocking new possibilities for high-performance quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a time-dependent extension of the quantum geometric tensor to describe the geometry of the time-parameter space for a quantum state, by considering small variations in both time and wave function parameters. Compared to the standard quantum geometric tensor, this tensor introduces new temporal components, enabling the analysis of systems with non-time-separable or explicitly time-dependent quantum states and encoding new information about these systems. In particular, the time-time component of this tensor is related to the energy dispersion of the system. We applied this framework to a harmonic/inverted oscillator, a time-dependent harmonic oscillator, and a chain of generalized harmonic/inverted oscillators. We show some results on the scalar curvature associated with the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and the generalized Berry curvature behavior on the transition from harmonic oscillators to inverted ones. Furthermore, we analyze the entanglement for the chain through purity analysis, obtaining that the purity for any excited state is zero in the mentioned transitions.</description>

      <title>Persistent fermionic entanglement under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of two indistinguishable fermions (with four accessible states each) that suffers decoherence without dissipation due to its coupling with a global bosonic bath at a fixed temperature. Using an appropriate measure of fermionic entanglement, we identify families of two-fermion states whose entanglement persists throughout the evolution, either fully or partially, despite the noisy effects of the interaction with the bath, and independently of its temperature. The identified resilience to decoherence provides valuable insights into the entanglement dynamics of open systems of indistinguishable fermions, and into the conditions under which long-lived entanglement emerges under more general decoherence channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation has emerged as a powerful approach to investigate complex quantum systems using digital quantum computers. Many-particle bosonic systems and intricate optical experimental setups pose significant challenges for classical simulation methods. Utilizing a recently developed formalism that maps bosonic operators to Pauli operators via the Gray code, we digitally simulate interferometric variants of Afshar's experiment on IBM's quantum computers. We investigate the analogous experiments of Unruh and Pessoa J\'unior, exploring discussions on the apparent violation of Bohr's complementarity principle when considering the entire experimental setup. Furthermore, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics. Our quantum computer demonstration results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions and underscore the potential of quantum computers as effective simulators for bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes.
  Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$.
  Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</description>

      <title>Clifford-Dressed Variational Principles for Precise Loschmidt Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced Clifford dressed Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) to efficiently compute many-body wavefunction amplitudes in the computational basis. This advancement enhances the study of Loschmidt echoes, which generally require accurate calculations of the overlap between the evolved state and the initial wavefunction. By incorporating Clifford disentangling gates during TDVP evolution, our method effectively controls entanglement growth while keeping the computation of these amplitudes accessible. Specifically, it reduces the problem to evaluating the overlap between a Matrix Product State (MPS) and a stabilizer state, a task that remains computationally feasible within the proposed framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we first benchmark it on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We then apply it to more challenging scenarios, including a non-integrable next-to-nearest-neighbor Ising chain and a two-dimensional Ising model. Our results highlight the versatility and efficiency of the Clifford-augmented MPS, showcasing its capability to go beyond the evaluation of simple expectation values. This makes it a powerful tool for exploring various aspects of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improved Quantum Computation using Operator Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence of quantum hardware is currently limiting its practical applications. At the same time, classical algorithms for simulating quantum circuits have progressed substantially. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid framework that integrates classical simulations with quantum hardware to improve the computation of an observable's expectation value by reducing the quantum circuit depth. In this framework, a quantum circuit is partitioned into two subcircuits: one that describes the backpropagated Heisenberg evolution of an observable, executed on a classical computer, while the other is a Schr\"odinger evolution run on quantum processors. The overall effect is to reduce the depths of the circuits executed on quantum devices, trading this with classical overhead and an increased number of circuit executions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a Hamiltonian simulation problem, achieving more accurate expectation value estimates compared to using quantum hardware alone.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Thermal Modeling of Microwave High Density Signaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit will be approximately 140 qubits.</description>

      <title>Chemically-Accurate Prediction of the Ionisation Potential of Helium Using a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the microscopic behaviour of materials and chemical processes by enabling high-accuracy electronic structure calculations to scale more efficiently than is possible using classical computers. Current quantum computing hardware devices suffer from the dual challenges of noise and cost, which raises the question of what practical value these devices might offer before full fault tolerance is achieved and economies of scale enable cheaper access. Here we examine the practical value of noisy quantum computers as tools for high-accuracy electronic structure, by using a Quantinuum ion-trap quantum computer to predict the ionisation potential of helium. By combining a series of techniques suited for use with current hardware including qubit-efficient encoding coupled with chemical insight, low-cost variational optimisation with hardware-adapted quantum circuits, and moments-based corrections, we obtain an ionisation potential of 24.5536 (+0.0011, -0.0005) eV, which agrees with the experimentally measured value to within true chemical accuracy, and with high statistical confidence. The methods employed here can be generalised to predict other properties and expand our understanding of the value that might be provided by near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Potential of photon-subtracted CV states towards gain sensitivity of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Cramer-Rao (QCR) bound is attached to a particular nonclassical state, therefore appropriate choice of the probe state is of the key importance to enhance sensitivity beyond classical one. Since the work of C.M. Caves (Phys. Rev. D 23 1693 (1981)) Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometry operates with single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) light coupled with a coherent state. We report the gain sensitivity of the phase-dependent MZ interferometer by more than 10 dB compared to the original result (Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 073601 (2008)) by using SMSV state with squeezing &lt;10 dB from which a certain number of photons was initially subtracted. The gain sensitivity is also observed when measuring the difference of output intensities of the SMSV state with squeezing &lt;3 dB from which 2,4,6 photons are subtracted and large coherent state. Overall, subtracting photons from the initially weakly squeezed light can prove to be a more efficient strategy in the quantum MZ interferometry compared to highly squeezed SMSV state generation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Circuits for the Quantum Lattice-Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for the linear advection-diffusion equation (ADE) Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) that leverages dynamic circuits. Dynamic quantum circuits allow for an optimized collision-operator quantum algorithm, introducing partial measurements as an integral step. Efficient adaptation of the quantum circuit during execution based on digital information obtained through mid-circuit measurements is achieved. The proposed new collision algorithm is implemented as a fully unitary operator, which facilitates the computation of multiple time steps without state reinitialization. Unlike previous quantum collision operators that rely on linear combinations of unitaries, the proposed algorithm does not exhibit a probabilistic failure rate. Moreover, additional qubits no longer depend on the chosen velocity set, which reduces both qubit overhead and circuit complexity. Validation of the quantum collision algorithm is performed by comparing results with digital LBM in one and two dimensions, demonstrating excellent agreement. Performance analysis for multiple time steps highlights advantages compared to previous methods. As an additional variant, a hybrid quantum-digital approach is proposed, which reduces the number of mid-circuit measurements, therefore improving the efficiency of the quantum collision algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for quantum molecular systems: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving quantum molecular systems presents a significant challenge for classical computation. The advent of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) devices offers a promising avenue to address these challenges, leveraging advanced quantum algorithms with reduced hardware requirements. This review surveys the latest developments in EFTQC and fully fault-tolerant quantum computing (FFTQC) algorithms for quantum molecular systems, covering encoding schemes, advanced Hamiltonian simulation techniques, and ground-state energy estimation methods. We highlight recent progress in overcoming practical barriers, such as reducing circuit depth and minimizing the use of ancillary qubits. Special attention is given to the potential quantum advantages achievable through these algorithms, as well as the limitations imposed by dequantization and classical simulation techniques. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions, emphasizing the need for optimized algorithms and experimental validation to bridge the gap between theoretical developments and practical implementation in EFTQC and FFTQC for quantum molecular systems.</description>

      <title>PALQA: A Novel Parameterized Position-Aware Lossy Quantum Autoencoder using LSB Control Qubit for Efficient Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing interest in quantum computing, quantum image processing technology has become a vital research field due to its versatile applications and ability to outperform classical computing. A quantum autoencoder approach has been used for compression purposes. However, existing autoencoders are limited to small-scale images, and the mechanisms of state compression remain unclear. There is also a need for efficient quantum autoencoders using standard representation approaches and for studying parameterized position-aware control qubits and their corresponding quality measurement metrics. This work introduces a novel parameterized position-aware lossy quantum autoencoder (PALQA) circuit that utilizes the least significant bit control qubit for image compression. The PALQA circuit employs a transformed coefficient block-based modified state connection approach to efficiently compress images at various resolutions. The method leverages compression opportunities in the state-label connection by applying position-aware least significant control qubit. Compared to JPEG and other enhanced quantum representation-based quantum autoencoders, the PALQA circuit demonstrates superior performance in terms of the number of gates required and PSNR metrics.</description>

      <title>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual gallimaufry of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, filters, and amplifiers can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample.
  Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions directly within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require response function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles.
  The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Repeater Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently distributing secret keys over long distances remains a critical challenge in the development of quantum networks. "First-generation" quantum repeater chains distribute entanglement by executing protocols composed of probabilistic entanglement generation, swapping and distillation operations. However, finding the protocol that maximizes the secret-key rate is difficult for two reasons. First, calculating the secretkey rate for a given protocol is non-trivial due to experimental imperfections and the probabilistic nature of the operations. Second, the protocol space rapidly grows with the number of nodes, and lacks any clear structure for efficient exploration. To address the first challenge, we build upon the efficient machinery developed by Li et al. [1] and we extend it, enabling numerical calculation of the secret-key rate for heterogeneous repeater chains with an arbitrary number of nodes. For navigating the large, unstructured space of repeater protocols, we implement a Bayesian optimization algorithm, which we find consistently returns the optimal result. Whenever comparisons are feasible, we validate its accuracy against results obtained through brute-force methods. Further, we use our framework to extract insight on how to maximize the efficiency of repeater protocols across varying node configurations and hardware conditions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization in exploring the potential of near-term quantum repeater chains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of solving a system of linear equations via the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). One drawback of the QSVT algorithm is that it requires huge quantum resources if we want to achieve an acceptable accuracy. To reduce the quantum cost, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that improves the accuracy and reduces the cost of the QSVT by adding iterative refinement in mixed-precision A first quantum solution is computed using the QSVT, in low precision, and then refined in higher precision until we get a satisfactory accuracy. For this solver, we present an error and complexity analysis, and first experiments using the quantum software stack myQLM.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical Nullifiers for Quantum Hypergraph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hypergraph states form a generalisation of the graph state formalism that goes beyond the pairwise (dyadic) interactions imposed by remaining inside the Gaussian approximation. Networks of such states are able to achieve universality for continuous variable measurement based quantum computation with only Gaussian measurements. For normalised states, the simplest hypergraph states are formed from $k$-adic interactions among a collection of $k$ harmonic oscillator ground states. However such powerful resources have not yet been observed in experiments and their robustness and scalability have not been tested. Here we develop and analyse necessary criteria for hypergraph nonclassicality based on simultaneous nonlinear squeezing in the nullifiers of hypergraph states. We put forward an essential analysis of their robustness to realistic scenarios involving thermalisation or loss and suggest several basic proof-of-principle options for experiments to observe nonclassicality in hypergraph states.</description>

      <title>Qubit-efficient quantum local search for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential component of many sophisticated metaheuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems is some variation of a local search routine that iteratively searches for a better solution within a chosen set of immediate neighbors. The size $l$ of this set is limited due to the computational costs required to run the method on classical processing units. We present a qubit-efficient variational quantum algorithm that implements a quantum version of local search with only $\lceil \log_2 l \rceil$ qubits and, therefore, can potentially work with classically intractable neighborhood sizes when realized on near-term quantum computers. Increasing the amount of quantum resources employed in the algorithm allows for a larger neighborhood size, improving the quality of obtained solutions. This trade-off is crucial for present and near-term quantum devices characterized by a limited number of logical qubits. Numerically simulating our algorithm, we successfully solved the largest graph coloring instance that was tackled by a quantum method. This achievement highlights the algorithm's potential for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces SpinGlassPEPS$.$jl, a software package implemented in Julia, designed to find low-energy configurations of generalized Potts models, including Ising and QUBO problems, utilizing heuristic tensor network contraction algorithms on quasi-2D geometries. In particular, the package employs the Projected Entangled-Pairs States to approximate the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the model's cost function. This enables an efficient branch-and-bound search (within the probability space) that exploits the locality of the underlying problem's topology. As a result, our software enables the discovery of low-energy configurations for problems on quasi-2D graphs, particularly those relevant to modern quantum annealing devices. The modular architecture of SpinGlassPEPS$.$jl supports various contraction schemes and hardware acceleration.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Numerical Framework for Improved Finite-Sized Key Rates with Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution requires tight and reliable bounds on the secret key rate to ensure robust security. This is particularly so for the regime of finite block sizes, where the optimization of generalized Renyi entropic quantities is known to provide tighter bounds on the key rate. However, such an optimization is often non-trivial, and the non-monotonicity of the key rate in terms of the Renyi parameter demands additional optimization to determine the optimal Renyi parameter as a function of block sizes. In this work, we present a tight analytical bound on the Renyi entropy in terms of the Renyi divergence and derive the analytical gradient of the Renyi divergence. This enables us to generalize existing state-of-the-art numerical frameworks for the optimization of the key rate. With this generalized framework, we show improvements in regimes of high loss and low block sizes, which are particularly relevant for long-distance satellite-based protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-unitary protocols are already at the base of many hybrid quantum computing applications, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era where quantum errors typically affect the unitary evolution. However, while the framework for Parameterized Quantum Circuits is widely developed, especially for applications where the parameters are optimized towards a set goal, we find there are still interesting opportunities in defining a unified framework also for non-unitary protocols in the form of Parameterized Quantum Channels as a computing resource. We first discuss the general parameterization strategies for controlling quantum channels and their practical realizations. Then we describe a simple example of application in the context of error mitigation, where the control parameters for the quantum channels are optimized in the presence of noise, in order to maximize channel fidelity with respect to a given target channel.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between the Number of Nodes in Wave Functions and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the complex relationship between Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the nodal structure of wave functions in a variety of quantum systems including the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a 1D box , and the particle on a ring. We argue that the uncertainty in conjugate variables, like location and momentum, is generally a function of the number of nodes. As our investigation reveals, the nature of this influence depends on the system. This paper demonstrates that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is influenced by the nodal structure of wave functions and how the nature of this dependence is system-dependent.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the power of global quantum gates with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional circuit-based quantum computing architectures, the standard gate set includes arbitrary single-qubit rotations and two-qubit entangling gates. However, this choice is not always aligned with the native operations available in certain hardware, where the natural entangling gates are not restricted to two qubits but can act on multiple, or even all, qubits simultaneously. However, leveraging the capabilities of global quantum operations for algorithm implementations is highly challenging, as directly compiling local gate sequences into global gates usually gives rise to a quantum circuit that is more complex than the original one. Here, we circumvent this difficulty using a variational approach. Specifically, we propose a parameterized circuit ansatze composed of a finite number of global gates and layers of single-qubit unitaries, which can be implemented in constant time. Furthermore, by construction, these ansatze are equivalent to linear depth local-gate quantum circuits and are highly expressible. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach by applying it to the problem of ground state preparation for the Heisenberg model and the toric code Hamiltonian, highlighting its potential to offer a practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Topological Tenfold Classification and the Entanglement of Two Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a constructive method utilizing the Cartan decomposition to characterize topological properties and their connection to two-qubit quantum entanglement, in the framework of the tenfold classification and Wootters' concurrence. This relationship is comprehensively established for the 2-qubit system through the antiunitary time reversal (TR) operator. The TR operator is shown to identify concurrence and differentiate between entangling and non-entangling operators. This distinction is of a topological nature, as the inclusion or exclusion of certain operators alters topological characteristics. Proofs are presented which demonstrate that the 2-qubit system can be described in the framework of the tenfold classification, unveiling aspects of the connection between entanglement and a geometrical phase. Topological features are obtained systematically by a mapping to a quantum graph, allowing for a direct computation of topological integers and of the 2-qubit equivalent of topological zero-modes. An additional perspective is provided regarding the extension of this new approach to condensed matter systems, illustrated through examples involving indistinguishable fermions and arrays of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled framework for the Advanced Encryption Standard in the post-quantum era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers create new security risks for today's encryption systems. This paper presents an improved version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that uses quantum technology to strengthen protection. Our approach offers two modes: a fully quantum-based method for maximum security and a hybrid version that works with existing infrastructure. The system generates encryption keys using quantum randomness instead of predictable computer algorithms, making keys virtually impossible to guess. It regularly refreshes these keys automatically to block long-term attacks, even as technology advances. Testing confirms the system works seamlessly with current security standards, maintaining fast performance for high-volume data transfers. The upgraded AES keeps its original security benefits while adding three key defenses: quantum-powered key creation, adjustable security settings for different threats, and safeguards against attacks that exploit device vulnerabilities. Organizations can implement this solution in stages--starting with hybrid mode for sensitive data while keeping older systems operational. This phased approach allows businesses to protect financial transactions, medical records, and communication networks today while preparing for more powerful quantum computers in the future. The design prioritizes easy adoption, requiring no costly replacements of existing hardware or software in most cases.</description>

      <title>An extended Wigner's friend no-go theorem inspired by generalized contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renowned Local Friendliness no-go theorem demonstrates the incompatibility of quantum theory with the combined assumptions of Absoluteness of Observed Events -- the idea that observed outcomes are singular and objective -- and Local Agency -- the requirement that the only events correlated with a setting choice are in its future light cone. This result is stronger than Bell's theorem because the assumptions of Local Friendliness are weaker than those of Bell's theorem: Local Agency is less restrictive than local causality, and Absoluteness of Observed Events is encompassed within the notion of realism assumed in Bell's theorem. Drawing inspiration from the correspondence between nonlocality proofs in Bell scenarios and generalized contextuality proofs in prepare-and-measure scenarios, we present the Operational Friendliness no-go theorem. This theorem demonstrates the inconsistency of quantum theory with the joint assumptions of Absoluteness of Observed Events and Operational Agency, the latter being a weaker version of noncontextuality, in the same way that Local Agency is a weaker version of local causality. Our result generalizes the Local Friendliness no-go theorem and is stronger than no-go theorems based on generalized noncontextuality.</description>

      <title>Frequency auto-homogenization using group-velocity-matched downconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the stability of integrated photonics at network nodes and the advantages of photons as flying qubits, photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) makes quantum networks increasingly scalable. However, scaling up PQIP requires the preparation of many identical single photons which is limited by the spectral distinguishability of integrated single-photon sources due to variations in fabrication or local environment. To address this, we introduce frequency auto-homogenization via group-velocity-matched downconversion to remove spectral distinguishability in varying quantum emitters. We present our theory using $\chi^{(2)}$ quantum frequency conversion and show proof-of-principle data in a free-space optical setup.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum magnetometry with a laser-written integrated photonic diamond chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02478v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can act as a precise quantum sensor even under ambient conditions. In particular, to optimize thier sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system, without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a high-quality buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with a 4.5 ppm density of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 pT.Hz $^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 pT.Hz $^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for microscale sensing with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Zernike Hamiltonians: Polynomial Higgs-type algebras and algebraic derivation of the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum analog of the generalized Zernike systems given by the Hamiltonian: $$ \hat{\mathcal{H}} _N =\hat{p}_1^2+\hat{p}_2^2+\sum_{k=1}^N \gamma_k (\hat{q}_1 \hat{p}_1+\hat{q}_2 \hat{p}_2)^k , $$ with canonical operators $\hat{q}_i,\, \hat{p}_i$ and arbitrary coefficients $\gamma_k$. This two-dimensional quantum model, besides the conservation of the angular momentum, exhibits higher-order integrals of motion within the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak h_2$. By constructing suitable combinations of these integrals, we uncover a polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra that, through an appropriate change of basis, gives rise to a deformed oscillator algebra. The associated structure function $\Phi$ is shown to factorize into two commuting components $\Phi=\Phi_1 \Phi_2$. This framework enables an algebraic determination of the possible energy spectra of the model for the cases $N=2,3,4$, the case $N=1$ being canonically equivalent to the harmonic oscillator. Based on these findings, we propose two conjectures which generalize the results for all $N\ge 2$ and any value of the coefficients $\gamma_k$, that they are explicitly proven for $N=5$. In addition, all of these results can be interpreted as superintegrable perturbations of the original quantum Zernike system corresponding to $N=2$ which are also analyzed and applied to the isotropic oscillator on the sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Developing techniques for Simulation of SU(3) Quantum Field Theories on State-of-the-Art Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long been an experimental technology with the potential to simulate, at scale, phenomena which on classical devices would be too expensive to simulate at any but the smallest scales. Over the last several years, however, it has entered the NISQ era, where the number of qubits are sufficient for quantum advantage but substantial noise on hardware stands in the way of this achievement. This thesis details NISQ device-centered improvements to techniques of quantum simulation of the out-of-equilbrium real-time dynamics of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and of dense 3-flavor neutrino systems on digital quantum devices.
  The first project concerning LQCD is a comparison of methods for implementing the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that initializes the ground state of an SU(3) plaquette-chain. The thesis then pivots to a 1+1D lattice of quarks interacting with an SU(3) gauge-field. A VQE-based state-preparation for the vacua and a Trotterized time-evolution circuit is designed and applied to the problems of simulating beta and neutrinoless double beta decay. Finally, these circuits are adapted to a version useable on quantum devices with nearest-neighbor connectivity with minimal overhead, with an eye towards utilizing the higher qubit count of such devices for hadron dynamics and scattering.
  This thesis covers two projects that concern dense 3-flavor neutrino systems. The first details design and testing of Trotterized time-evolution circuits on state-of-the-art quantum devices. The second, motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem's result that deviation from stabilizer states ("magic") is necessary for a problem to exhibit quantum advantage, details results with implications for the Standard Model in general that the 3 flavor ultradense neutrino systems with the highest, most-persistent magic are those that start with neutrinos in all 3 flavors.</description>

      <title>Emulating non-Hermitian dynamics in a finite non-dissipative quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the emulation of non-Hermitian dynamics during a given time window by a low-dimensional quantum system coupled to a finite set of equidistant discrete states acting as an effective continuum. We first emulate the decay of an unstable state, and map the quasi-continuum parameters enabling a precise approximation of the non-Hermitian dynamics. The limitations of this model, including in particular short- and long- time deviations, are extensively discussed. We then consider a driven two-dimensional system, and establish criteria for the non-Hermitian dynamics emulation with a finite quasi-continuum. We quantitatively analyze the signatures of finiteness of the effective continuum, addressing the possible emergence of non-Markovian behavior during the time interval considered. Finally, we investigate the emulation of dissipative dynamics using a finite quasi-continuum with a tailored density of states. We show on the example of a two-level system that such a continuum can reproduce non-Hermitian dynamics more efficiently than the usual equidistant quasi-continuum model.</description>

      <title>Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with deep connections to entanglement, magic, and uncertainty relations. Entanglement, for instance, has driven key advances like surface codes and has deepened our understanding of quantum gravity through holographic quantum codes. While these connections are well-explored, the role of contextuality, a fundamental non-classical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. Notably, Bell nonlocality is a special case of contextuality, and prior works have established contextuality as a key resource for quantum computational advantage.
  In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. Using a sheaf-theoretic framework, we define contextuality for such codes and prove key results on its manifestation. Specifically, we prove the equivalence of contextuality definitions from Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic framework and Kirby--Love's tree-based approach for the partial closure of Pauli measurement sets. We present several findings, including the proof of a conjecture by Kim and Abramsky [1]. We further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. Our findings reveal a direct connection between contextuality and quantum error correction, offering new insights into the non-classical resources enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel chain rule for a family of channel conditional entropies, covering von Neumann and sandwiched R\'{e}nyi entropies. In the process, we show that these channel conditional entropies are equal to their regularized version, and more generally, additive across tensor products of channels. For the purposes of cryptography, applying our chain rule to sequences of channels yields a new variant of R\'{e}nyi entropy accumulation, in which we can impose some specific forms of marginal-state constraint on the input states to each individual channel. This generalizes a recently introduced security proof technique that was developed to analyze prepare-and-measure QKD with no limitations on the repetition rate. In particular, our generalization yields ``fully adaptive'' protocols that can in principle update the entropy estimation procedure during the protocol itself, similar to the quantum probability estimation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid development of quantum computing technology has led to a wide variety of sophisticated quantum devices. Benchmarking these systems becomes crucial for understanding their capabilities and paving the way for future advancements. The Quantum Volume (QV) test is one of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating quantum computer performance due to its architecture independence. However, as the number of qubits in a quantum device grows, the test faces a significant limitation: classical simulation of the quantum circuit, which is indispensable for evaluating QV, becomes computationally impractical. In this work, we propose modifications of the QV test that allow for direct determination of the most probable outcomes (heavy output subspace) of a quantum circuit, eliminating the need for expensive classical simulations. This approach resolves the scalability problem of the Quantum Volume test beyond classical computational capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Every state on the algebra $M_n$ of complex nxn matrices restricts to a state on any matrix system. Whereas the restriction to a matrix system is generally not open, we prove that the restriction to every *-subalgebra of $M_n$ is open. This simplifies topology problems in matrix theory and quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating and distributing remote entangled pairs (EPs) is the most important responsibility of quantum networks, because entanglement serves as the fundamental resource for important quantum networks applications. A key performance metric for quantum networks is the time-to-serve (TTS) for users' EP requests, which is the time to distribute EPs between the requesting users. Reducing the TTS is critically important given the limited qubit coherence time. In this paper, we study the Adaptive Continuous entanglement generation Protocol (ACP), which enables quantum network nodes to continuously generate EPs with their neighbors, while adaptively selecting the neighbors to reduce the TTS. Meanwhile, entanglement purification is used to mitigate the idling decoherence of the EPs generated by the ACP prior to the arrival user requests. We extend the capability of the SeQUeNCe simulator to allow the implementation of the ACP with full support. Then through extensive simulations, we evaluate the ACP at different network scales, demonstrating significant improvements in both the TTS (up to 94% decrease) and the fidelity (up to 0.05 increase) of distributed entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Automated tuning and characterization of a single-electron transistor charge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an automated protocol for tuning single-electron transistors (SETs) or single-hole transistors (SHTs) to operate as precise charge sensors. Using minimal device-specific information, the protocol performs measurements to enable the selection and ranking of high-sensitivity operating points. It also characterizes key device parameters, such as dot radius and gate lever arms, through acquisition and analysis of Coulomb diamonds. Demonstration on an accumulation-mode silicon SET at 1.5 K highlights its potential in the 1-2 K range for "hot" spin qubits in scalable quantum computing systems. This approach significantly reduces the tuning time compared to manual methods, with future improvements aimed at faster runtimes and dynamic feedback for robustness to charge fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Alberti-Uhlmann criterion beyond qubit dichotomies</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.04294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alberti-Uhlmann criterion states that any given qubit dichotomy can be transformed into any other given qubit dichotomy by a quantum channel if and only if the testing region of the former dichotomy includes the testing region of the latter dichotomy. Here, we generalize the Alberti-Uhlmann criterion to the case of arbitrary number of qubit or qutrit states. We also derive an analogous result for the case of qubit or qutrit measurements with arbitrary number of elements. We demonstrate the possibility of applying our criterion in a semi-device independent way.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum circuits using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the limiting capabilities of classical methods in simulating complex quantum systems is of paramount importance for quantum technologies. Although many advanced approaches have been proposed and recently used to challenge quantum advantage experiments, novel efficient methods for the approximate simulation of complex quantum systems are still in high demand. Here we propose a scalable technique for approximate simulations of intermediate-size quantum circuits on the basis of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and Riemannian optimization. The MERA is a tensor network, whose geometry together with orthogonality constraints imposed on its tensors allow approximating many-body quantum states lying beyond the area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. We benchmark the proposed technique for brick-wall quantum circuits of up to 243 qubits with various depths up to 20 layers. Our approach paves a way to exploring efficient simulation techniques for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Universal robust quantum gates by geometric correspondence of noisy quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exposure to noises is a major obstacle for processing quantum information, but noises don't necessarily induce errors. Errors on the quantum gates could be suppressed via robust quantum control techniques. But understanding the genesis of errors and finding a universal treatment remains grueling. To resolve this issue, we develop a geometric theory to capture quantum dynamics due to various noises graphically, obtaining the quantum erroneous evolution diagrams (QEED). Our theory provides explicit necessary and sufficient criteria for robust control Hamiltonian and quantitative geometric metrics of the gate error. We then develop a protocol to engineer a universal set of single- and two-qubit robust gates that correct the generic errors. Our numerical simulation shows gate fidelities above $99.99\%$ over a broad region of noise strength using simplest and smooth pulses for arbitrary gate time. Our approach offers new insights into the geometric aspects of noisy quantum dynamics and several advantages over existing methods, including the treatment of arbitrary noises, independence of system parameters, scalability, and being friendly to experiments.</description>

      <title>No-Signaling in Steepest Entropy Ascent: A Nonlinear Non-local Non-equilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Composite Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindbladian formalism models open quantum systems using a 'bottom-up' approach, deriving linear dynamics from system-environment interactions. We present a 'top-down' approach starting with phenomenological constraints, focusing on system's structure, subsystems' interactions, environmental effects, and often using a non-equilibrium variational principle designed to enforce strict thermodynamic consistency. However, incorporating the second law's requirement - that Gibbs states are the sole stable equilibria - necessitates nonlinear dynamics, challenging no-signaling principles in composite systems. We reintroduce 'local perception operators' and show that they allow to model signaling-free non-local effects. Using the steepest-entropy-ascent variational principle as an example, we demonstrate the validity of the 'top-down' approach for integrating quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in phenomenological models, with potential applications in quantum computing and resource theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying many-body quantum chaos is one of the big challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. We tackle this problem in the context of a set of perturbed quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians defined on graphs. This allows us to disentangle the geometrical properties of the underlying single-particle problem and the importance of the interaction terms, showing that the former is the dominant feature ensuring the single-particle to many-body chaotic transition. Our results are verified numerically with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, capable of extracting eigenvalues in a desired energy window of very large Hamiltonians. Our approach essentially provides a new way of viewing many-body chaos from a single-particle perspective.</description>

      <title>Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as one of the key performance measures for computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, proving its energy-consumption advantage has been challenging due to the lack of a theoretical foundation linking the physical concept of energy with the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation, based on a computational model conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. Within this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation, accounting for imperfections in implementation appearing in practice. As part of this analysis, we construct a protocol for Landauer erasure with finite precision in a finite number of steps, which constitutes a contribution of independent interest. Additionally, we develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation, based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. Using these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a paradigmatic computational problem -- Simon's problem. Furthermore, we propose explicit criteria for experimentally demonstrating this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation, analogous to the experimental demonstrations of quantum computational supremacy. These results establish a foundational framework and techniques to explore the energy consumption of computation, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>On the Emergent "Quantum" Theory in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schr\"odinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced high-dimensional teleportation in correlated amplitude damping noise by weak measurement and environment-assisted measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional teleportation provides various benefits in quantum networks and repeaters, but all these advantages rely on the high-quality distribution of high-dimensional entanglement over a noisy channel. It is essential to consider correlation effects when two entangled qutrits travel sequentially through the same channel. In this paper, we present two strategies for enhancing qutrit teleportation in correlated amplitude damping (CAD) noise by weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM). The fidelity of both approaches has been dramatically improved due to the probabilistic nature of WM and EAM. We have observed that the correlation effects of CAD noise result in an increase in the probability of success. A comparison has demonstrated that the EAM scheme usually outperforms the WM scheme in regard to fidelity. Our research expands the capabilities of WM and EAM as quantum techniques to combat CAD noise in qutrit teleportation, facilitating the development of advanced quantum technologies in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Pauli Spectrum and Non-stabilizerness of Typical Quantum Many-Body States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important question of quantum information is to characterize genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) resources necessary for universal quantum computing. Here, we use the Pauli spectrum to quantify how magic, beyond Clifford, typical many-qubit states are. We first present a phenomenological picture of the Pauli spectrum based on quantum typicality and then confirm it for Haar random states. We then introduce filtered stabilizer entropy, a magic measure that can resolve the difference between typical and atypical states. We proceed with the numerical study of the Pauli spectrum of states created by random circuits as well as for eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. We find that in both cases the Pauli spectrum approaches the one of Haar random states, up to exponentially suppressed tails. Our results underscore differences between typical and atypical states from the point of view of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices for Ground State Preparation through Adaptive Finer Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is increasing the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace filtering through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) combined with spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to $10^{-4}$. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>

Abstract: What does it mean for a causal structure to be `unknown'? Can we even talk about `repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structure are independent and identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition -- symmetry under exchange -- with a very particular multipartite structure: a mixture of identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with arbitrary causal structure, including indefinite causal order and multi-time, non-Markovian processes applicable to noisy quantum devices. The result also implies a new class of de Finetti theorems for quantum states subject to a large class of linear constraints, which can be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterising the performance of noisy quantum circuits is central to the production of prototype quantum computers and can enable improved quantum error correction that exploits noise biases identified in a quantum device. We develop a scalable noise characterisation protocol suited to characterising the syndrome extraction circuits of quantum error correcting codes, a key component of fault-tolerant architectures. Our protocol builds upon averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a framework for noise characterisation experiments that simultaneously estimates the Pauli error probabilities of all gates in a Clifford circuit, and captures averaged spatial correlations between gates implemented simultaneously in the layers of the circuit. By rigorously analysing the performance of noise characterisation experiments in the ACES framework, we derive a figure of merit for their expected performance, allowing us to optimise their experimental design and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental resources. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our protocol through circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise characterisation procedure for the syndrome extraction circuit of a distance 25 surface code with over 1000 qubits. Our results indicate that detailed noise characterisation methods are scalable to near-term quantum devices. We release our code in the form of the Julia package QuantumACES.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>

Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a 1d transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a non-integrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of quantum states and devices is paramount to quantum science and technology. The characterization consists of individual measurements, which are required to be precisely known. A mismatch between actual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this characterization. Here, we show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction artifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and quantify the mismatch and gain information about the actual measurement operators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in quantum measurement and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in (2 + 1)D subsystem-symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of unitary evolution and projective measurements is a modern interest in the study of many-body entanglement. On the one hand, the competition between these two processes leads to the recently discovered measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). On the other hand, measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a well-known computational paradigm where measurements simulate unitary evolution by utilizing the entanglement of special resources such as the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. The entanglement properties enabling MBQC may be attributed to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders, particularly subsystem-symmetric topological (SSPT) orders. It was recently found that the one-dimensional cluster state may be associated with an SPT phase in random circuits respecting a global $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and furthermore that all phase transitions in this scenario belong to the same universality class. As resources with greater computational power feature greater symmetry, it is fruitful to investigate further any relationship between levels of symmetry in MIPTs and MBQC. In this paper we investigate MIPTs on a torus with three levels of symmetry-respecting unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. Although we find two area-law phases and one volume-law phase with distinct entanglement structures for each ensemble, the phase transition from the volume-law phase to the area-law phase associated with the 2D SSPT cluster state has variable correlation length exponent $\nu$. Whereas $\nu\approx 0.90$ for unconstrained Clifford unitaries and $\nu\approx0.83$ for globally-symmetric Cliffords, subsystem-symmetric Cliffords feature a much smaller value $\nu\approx 0.38$. We discuss how these distinct $\nu$'s quantify spacetime response scales where quantum information is manipulated by single-qubit measurements as in MBQC.</description>

      <title>Finding quantum partial assignments by search-to-decision reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computer science, many search problems are reducible to decision problems, which implies that finding a solution is as hard as deciding whether a solution exists. A quantum analogue of search-to-decision reductions would be to ask whether a quantum algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle can construct $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses as quantum states. By a result from Irani, Natarajan, Nirkhe, Rao, and Yuen (CCC '22), it is known that this does not hold relative to a quantum oracle, unlike the cases of $\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{MA}$, and $\mathsf{QCMA}$ where search-to-decision relativizes. We prove that if one is not interested in the quantum witness as a quantum state but only in terms of its partial assignments, i.e. the reduced density matrices, then there exists a classical polynomial-time algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle that outputs approximations of the density matrices of a near-optimal quantum witness, for any desired constant locality and inverse polynomial error. Our construction is based on a circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping that approximately preserves near-optimal $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses and a new $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem, Low-energy Density Matrix Verification, which is called by the $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle to adaptively construct approximately consistent density matrices of a low-energy state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach for witnessing quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, based on heat generation. Inspired by Maxwell's demon, we ask what the optimal heat exchange between a quantum system and a thermal environment is when the process is assisted by a quantum memory. We derive fundamental energy constraints in this scenario and show that quantum states can reveal non-classical signatures via heat exchange. This approach leads to a heat-based witness for quantum properties, offering an alternative to system-specific measurements, as it only relies on fixed energy measurements in a thermal ancilla. We illustrate our findings with the detection of entanglement in isotropic states and coherence in two-spin systems interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error filtration is a hardware scheme that mitigates noise by exploiting auxiliary qubits and entangling gates. Although both signal and ancillas are subject to local noise, constructive interference(and in some cases post-selection) allows us to reduce the noise level in the signal qubit. Here we determine the optimal entangling unitary gates that make the qubits interfere most effectively,starting from a set of universal gates and proceeding by optimizing suitable functionals by gradient-descent or stochastic approximation. We examine how our optimized scheme behaves under imperfect implementation, where ancillary qubits may be noisy or subject to cross-talk. Even with these imperfections, we find that adding more ancillary qubits helps in protecting quantum information.We benchmark our approach against figures of merit that correspond to different applications, including entanglement fidelity, quantum Fisher information (for applications in quantum sensing),and CHSH value (for cryptographic applications), with one, two, and three ancillary qubits. With one and two ancillas we also provide analytical explicit expressions from an ansatz for the optimal unitary. We also compare our method with the recently introduced Superposed Quantum Error Mitigation (SQEM) scheme based on superposition of causal orders, and show that, for a wide range of noise strengths, our approach may outperform SQEM in terms of effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Unitary description of the Jaynes-Cummings model under fractional-time dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-evolution operator corresponding to the fractional-time Schr\"odinger equation is nonunitary because it fails to preserve the norm of the vector state in the course of its evolution. However, in the context of the time-dependent non-Hermitian quantum formalism applied to the time-fractional dynamics, it has been demonstrated that a unitary evolution can be achieved for a traceless two-level Hamiltonian. This is accomplished by considering a dynamical Hilbert space embedding a time-dependent metric operator concerning which the system unitarily evolves in time. This allows for a suitable description of a quantum system consistent with the standard quantum mechanical principles. In this work, we investigate the Jaynes-Cummings model in the fractional-time scenario taking into account the fractional-order parameter $\alpha$ and its effect in unitary quantum dynamics. We analyze the well-known dynamical properties, such as the atomic population inversion and the atom-field entanglement, when the atom starts in its excited state and the field in a coherent state.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Bound for Quantum Machine Learning in NISQ Era -- A Survey</title>

Abstract: Despite the mounting anticipation for the quantum revolution, the success of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era hinges on a largely unexplored factor: the generalization error bound, a cornerstone of robust and reliable machine learning models. Current QML research, while exploring novel algorithms and applications extensively, is predominantly situated in the context of noise-free, ideal quantum computers. However, Quantum Circuit (QC) operations in NISQ-era devices are susceptible to various noise sources and errors. In this article, we conduct a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to explore the state-of-the-art generalization bound for supervised QML in NISQ-era and analyze the latest practices in the field. Our study systematically summarizes the existing computational platforms with quantum hardware, datasets, optimization techniques, and the common properties of the bounds found in the literature. We further present the performance accuracy of various approaches in classical benchmark datasets like the MNIST and IRIS datasets. The SMS also highlights the limitations and challenges in QML in the NISQ era and discusses future research directions to advance the field. Using a detailed Boolean operators query in five reliable indexers, we collected 544 papers and filtered them to a small set of 37 relevant articles. This filtration was done following the best practice of SMS with well-defined research questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology via Floquet-Engineered Two-axis Twisting and Turn Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One core of quantum metrology is the utilization of entanglement to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit. Here, we utilize the Floquet-engineered two-axis twisting (TAT) and turn dynamics to generate GHZ-like states for quantum metrology. Using both analytical semi-classical and quantum approaches, we find that the desired $N$-particle GHZ-like state can be produced in a remarkably short time $t_\mathrm{opt}\propto \ln{N}/{N}$, and its quantum Fisher information $F^\mathrm{opt}_\mathrm{Q}\propto N^2$ approaches the Heisenberg limit. Owing to the rapid state preparation, it shows outstanding robustness against decoherence. Moreover, using the Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn, one may implement an efficient interaction-based readout protocol to extract the signal encoded in this GHZ-like state. This Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn approach offers a viable method to achieve effective time-reversal dynamics to improve measurement precision and resilience against detection noise, all without the need to invert the sign of the nonlinear interaction. This study paves a way for achieving entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via rapid generation of GHZ-like states at high particle numbers through continuous Floquet engineering.</description>

Abstract: Informational contributions to thermodynamics can be studied in isolation by considering systems with fully-degenerate Hamiltonians. In this regime, being in non-equilibrium -- termed informational non-equilibrium -- provides thermodynamic resources, such as extractable work, solely from the information content. The usefulness of informational non-equilibrium creates an incentive to obtain more of it, motivating the question of how to concentrate it: can we increase the local informational non-equilibrium of a product state $\rho\otimes\rho$ under a global closed system (unitary) evolution? We fully solve this problem analytically, showing that it is impossible for two-qubits, and it is always possible to find states achieving this in higher dimensions. Specifically for two-qutrits, we find that there is a single unitary achieving optimal concentration for every state, for which we uncover a Mepmba-like effect. We further discuss the notion of bound resources in this framework, initial global correlations' ability to activate concentration, and applications to concentrating purity and intrinsic randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance $W_{1}$ corresponding to optical tomograms of nonclassical states faithfully captures changes that arise due to photon addition to, or subtraction from, these states. $W_{1}$ is a true measure of distance in the quantum state space, and is sensitive to the underlying interference structures that arise in the tomogram after changes in the photon number. Our procedure is universally applicable to the cat and squeezed states, the former displaying the characteristic negativity in its Wigner function, while the latter does not do so. We explicate this in the case of the squeezed vacuum and even coherent states and show that photon addition (or subtraction) is mirrored in the shift in the intensity of specific regions in the tomogram. Further, we examine the dependence of $W_{1}$ on the squeezing parameter, and its sensitivity to different quadratures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is an attractive measure for the rate at which quantum operators spread in the space of all possible operators under dynamical evolution. One expects that its late-time plateau would distinguish between integrable and chaotic dynamics, but its ability to do so depends precariously on the choice of the initial seed. We propose to apply such considerations not to a single operator, but simultaneously to a collection of initial seeds in the manner of the block-Lanczos algorithm. We furthermore suggest that this collection should comprise all simple (few-body) operators in the theory, which echoes the applications of Nielsen complexity to dynamical evolution. The resulting construction, unlike the conventional Krylov complexity, reliably distinguishes integrable and chaotic Hamiltonians without any need for fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that starting only with strong, projective quantum measurements, experiments can be designed to allow weak measurements, which lead to random walk between the possible final measurement outcomes. However, one can ask the reverse question: starting with only weak measurements, can all the results of standard strong measurements be recovered? Prior work has shown that some results can be, such as the Born rule for the probability of measurement outcomes as a function of wave intensity. In this paper we show that another crucial result can be reproduced by purely weak measurements, namely the collapse of a many-body, nonlocally entangled wave function on a time scale comparable to the characteristic time of a single, local measurement; for an entangled state of a single excitation among $N$ qubits, we find the collapse time scales as a double logarithm of $N$. This result affirms the self-consistency of the hypothesis that spontaneous weak measurements lie at the base of all physical measurements, independent of human observers.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of phonon hopping in trapped ions by modulation of the trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local modes of trapped ions can be used to construct an analog quantum simulator and a digital quantum computer. However, the control of the phonon hopping remains difficult because it proceeds among all the local modes through the Coulomb coupling. We propose a method to cancel the phonon hopping among a given set of local modes by applying a sequence of phase shift gates implemented through the modulation of the trap potential. We analyze the error scaling in the algorithm to treat three or more modes and show that the error can be suppressed by repeating the pulse sequence. The duration of the phase shift gate in the present method can be as short as a few microseconds, which is an order of magnitude faster than the laser-based method. This short duration of the phase shift gate facilitates the suppression of the gate error. We finally show how the present method can be applied to the implementation of the beam splitter. The present method can also be applied to the simulation of bosonic systems as well as to the continuous variable encoding of quantum computing using trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits.
  We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation (i.e., an approximation with constant relative accuracy) of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation.
  For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results and their implications for the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Channel Reshaping for Improved Entanglement Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum communication and computation heavily rely on entanglement distillation protocols. There is a plethora of distillation protocols for Pauli channels and also for some non-Pauli channels. However, an effort to relate the effectiveness of these protocols has been missing. For most quantum channels, the gap between the existing lower and upper bounds on distillation rates is substantial, and improvements of achievable rates have been stagnant for decades. In this work, we improve the best known distillation lower bounds, for both the amplitude damping and depolarizing channels. We build on a key observation that distillation protocols reshape several uses of a very noisy channel into a better effective channel. We apply this channel processing in an adaptive and recurrent manner. For the amplitude damping channel, our suggested protocol reshapes the channel into an erasure channel, achieving rates exceeding the best known lower bound given by the channel's reverse coherent information. For the depolarizing channel, we introduce the Greedy recurrence protocol with proven performance guarantees and construct a combined protocol improving upon previously known distillation rates. Improved bounds on attainable distillation rates give insights for both practical implementations and theoretical understanding of quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</description>

      <title>An Implementation of the Finite Element Method in Hybrid Classical/Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the Quantum Finite Element Method (Q-FEM) developed for use in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and employs the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) algorithm. The proposed method leverages the classical FEM procedure to perform the unitary decomposition of the stiffness matrix and employs generator functions to design explicit quantum circuits corresponding to the unitaries. Q-FEM keeps the structure of the finite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element lengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is tested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic shape functions. Numerical verification studies are performed on the IBM QISKIT simulator and it is demonstrated that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the correct solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including with different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary conditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to problems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate that the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially with the number of qubits to increase the odds of convergence. Moreover, the deterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren plateaus and convergence difficulties.</description>

      <title>Conditional t-independent spectral gap for random quantum circuits and implications for t-design depths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question is understanding the rate at which random quantum circuits converge to the Haar measure. One quantity which is important in establishing this rate is the spectral gap of a random quantum ensemble. In this work we establish a new bound on the spectral gap of the t-th moment of a one-dimensional brickwork architecture on N qudits. This bound is independent of both t and N, provided t does not exceed the qudit dimension q. We also show that the bound is nearly optimal. The improved spectral gaps gives large improvements to the constant factors in known results on the approximate t-design depths of the 1D brickwork, of generic circuit architectures, and of specially-constructed architectures which scramble in depth O(log N). We moreover show that the spectral gap gives the dominant epsilon-dependence of the t-design depth at small epsilon. Our spectral gap bound is obtained by bounding the N-site 1D brickwork architecture by the spectra of 3-site operators. We then exploit a block-triangular hierarchy and a global symmetry in these operators in order to efficiently bound them. The technical methods used are a qualitatively different approach for bounding spectral gaps and and have little in common with previous techniques.</description>

Abstract: One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Single-shot detection limits of quantum illumination with multipartite qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum illumination is a protocol for detecting a low-reflectivity target by using two-mode entangled states composed of signal and idler modes. In this study, we extend the two-mode qubit states to three-mode qubit states, exploring the following configurations: (i) three signals, (ii) two signals and one idler, and (iii) one signal and two idlers. Each configuration considers various three-qubit states, such as GHZ state, W state, bipartite entangled states, and product states. We derive single-shot detection limits of the three-qubit states under white noise environment, evaluating the detection error probabilities for each configuration. We obtain that the performance is enhanced by the entanglement between signal and idler qubits, whereas it is degraded by the entanglement between signal qubits. In particular, the optimal probe state is not a maximally entangled state but a bipartite entangled state. Moreover, we show that the order of detection error probabilities is consistently certified by the quantum mutual information for the three-qubit probe states. Furthermore, we devote attention to whether this tendency maintains even in multipartite qudit states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have advanced rapidly in qubit count and gate fidelity. However, large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing still relies on quantum error correction code (QECC) to suppress noise. Manually or experimentally verifying the fault-tolerance property of complex QECC implementation is impractical due to the vast error combinations. This paper formalizes the fault-tolerance of QECC implementations within the language of quantum programs. By incorporating the techniques of quantum symbolic execution, we provide an automatic verification tool for quantum fault-tolerance. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool on a universal set of logical operations across different QECCs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical generation and design of quantum codes for resource-efficient loss-tolerant quantum communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop novel protocols for generating loss-tolerant quantum codes; these are central for safeguarding information against qubit losses, with most crucial applications in quantum communications. Contrary to current proposals, our method enables top-to-bottom fast encoding and decoding, thereby significantly reducing the additional losses due to the lagging and photon-reordering at the repeater stations. At the hardware level, we show how to achieve this with a single quantum emitter equipped with a static feedback mechanism, which we leverage to engineer entangling gates between a fed-back qubit and multiple emitted qubits in parallel. In addition, analyzing typical patterns within the error-correction decoding graphs, we find optimizations of the code structure, which enable higher performance by also reducing the code size; these are based on the introduction of asymmetries in the code, which mimic the intrinsic adaptiveness of the recovery procedure. We show numerically that these improvements together significantly enhance the loss-correction performance, with major advantages in quantum repeater protocols, where the fast recovery scheme (decoding-encoding) allows for improved repeater rates with smaller photon numbers per code.</description>

      <title>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, states that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</description>

Abstract: Maximizing the amount of work harvested from an environment is important for a wide variety of biological and technological processes, from energy-harvesting processes such as photosynthesisto energy storage systems such as fuels and batteries. Here we consider the maximization of free energy -- and by extension, the maximum extractable work -- that can be gained by a classical or quantum system that undergoes driving by its environment. We consider how the free energy gain depends on the initial state of the system, while also accounting for the cost of preparing the system. We provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for increasing the gain of free energy by varying the initial state. We also derive simple formulae that relate the free energy gained using the optimal initial state rather than another suboptimal initial state. Finally, we demonstrate that the problem of finding the optimal initial state may have two distinct regimes, one easy and one difficult, depending on the temperatures used for preparation and work extraction. We illustrate our results on a simple model of an information engine.</description>

Abstract: Superradiance, in which the collective behavior of emitters can generate enhanced radiative decay, was first predicted by a model, now known as the Dicke model, that contains a collection of two-level systems (the emitters) all interacting with the same photonic mode. In this article, we extend the original Dicke model to elucidate the influence of nuclear motion on superradiant emission. Our dynamical simulations of the combined electronic, nuclear, and photonic system reveal a new time scale attributed to the population leakage of the dark, subradiant states. Furthermore, this dark state emission pathway can be controlled by tuning the nuclear potential energy landscape. These findings impact how superradiant states and molecular degrees of freedom can be leveraged and utilized in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Optical manifestations and bounds of topological Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Deterministic identification over channels with finite output: a dimensional perspective on superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension $d$ of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq \frac12 d$. Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a "Hypothesis Testing Lemma" showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong interaction effect in synthetic spin-orbit coupling with mixed spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles contain symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. This mixed spin symmetry has been overlooked and has not been investigated thoroughly. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. Similarly to two-particle systems, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. Also, the emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. In contrast to two-particle systems, the pair correlation of the ground state is analogous to the Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions, and this feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Towards a group structure for superluminal velocity boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canonical subluminal Lorentz boosts have a clear geometric interpretation. They can be neatly expressed as hyperbolic rotations, that leave both the family of $2$-sheet hyperboloids within the light cone, and the family $1$-sheet hyperboloids exterior to it, invariant. In this work, we construct a map between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding operators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot `jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least not classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself, generate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are discussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in $(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different way. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to existing models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts within a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology, that contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set containing both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results to higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes \cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field facing a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further exacerbating the regional talent gap due to deficiencies in educational infrastructure and limited financial support. This work presents the efforts of the Quantum Computing Research Group at Universidad Nacional de Colombia to integrate quantum computing into higher education using the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we examine the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. The nonlinear interactions are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>Self-induced Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in a supersolid dipolar quantum gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.</description>
