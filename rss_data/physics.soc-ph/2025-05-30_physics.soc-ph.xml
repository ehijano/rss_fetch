      <title>From Signed Networks to Group Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that when there is a symmetry in a process defined on the nodes of a network, this can be captured by a new structure, the ``group graph'', in which group elements label the links of a network. I show that group graphs are a generalisation of signed networks which are an example of a $Z_2$ group graph. I also show that the concept of balance in signed networks can be generalised to group graphs. Finally, I show how the dynamics of processes on a consistent group graph are completely controlled by the topology of the underlying network, not by the symmetry group. This generalises recent results on signed networks (Tian and Lambiotte, 2024a) and complex networks (Tian and Lambiotte, 2024b).</description>

      <title>An operatorial view of competition and cooperation in a network of economic agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network of agents interacting both with competitive and/or cooperative mechanisms is modeled by using fermionic ladder operators. The time evolution of the network is assumed to be governed by a Hermitian time-independent Hamiltonian operator, and the mean values of the number operators are interpreted as a measure of the wealth status of the agents. Besides classical Heisenberg, we use the recently introduced $(H,\rho)$-induced dynamics approach to account for some actions able to provide a self-adjustment of the network according to its time evolution. Some numerical simulations are presented and discussed. Remarkably, we show that, in a network where cooperation may emerge, the average wealth of the agents is higher, and there is a very low level of inequality.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Emergent social conventions and collective bias in LLM populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social conventions are the backbone of social coordination, shaping how individuals form a group. As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.</description>

      <title>On the definition and importance of interpretability in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large datasets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models comprising simple mathematical expressions, their findings cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of machine learning's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable machine learning from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for scientific machine learning (SciML), they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.</description>
