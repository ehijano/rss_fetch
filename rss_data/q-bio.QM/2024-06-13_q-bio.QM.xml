      <title>MMIL: A novel algorithm for disease associated cell type discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell datasets often lack individual cell labels, making it challenging to identify cells associated with disease. To address this, we introduce Mixture Modeling for Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL), an expectation maximization method that enables the training and calibration of cell-level classifiers using patient-level labels. Our approach can be used to train e.g. lasso logistic regression models, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks. When applied to clinically-annotated, primary patient samples in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), our method accurately identifies cancer cells, generalizes across tissues and treatment timepoints, and selects biologically relevant features. In addition, MMIL is capable of incorporating cell labels into model training when they are known, providing a powerful framework for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. Mixture Modeling for MIL offers a novel approach for cell classification, with significant potential to advance disease understanding and management, especially in scenarios with unknown gold-standard labels and high dimensionality.</description>

      <title>DualBind: A Dual-Loss Framework for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial for drug development. Recent advances in machine learning show promising results on this task. However, these methods typically rely heavily on labeled data, which can be scarce or unreliable, or they rely on assumptions like Boltzmann-distributed data that may not hold true in practice. Here, we present DualBind, a novel framework that integrates supervised mean squared error (MSE) with unsupervised denoising score matching (DSM) to accurately learn the binding energy function. DualBind not only addresses the limitations of DSM-only models by providing more accurate absolute affinity predictions but also improves generalizability and reduces reliance on labeled data compared to MSE-only models. Our experimental results demonstrate that DualBind excels in predicting binding affinities and can effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>ECG Classification System for Arrhythmia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrhythmia is just one of the many cardiovascular illnesses that have been extensively studied throughout the years. Using multi-lead ECG data, this research describes a deep learning (DL) pipeline technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to detect cardiovascular lar arrhythmia in patients. The suggested model architecture has hidden layers with a residual block in addition to the input and output layers. In this study, the classification of the ECG signals into five main groups, namely: Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), and Normal Beat (N), are performed. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, we assessed the suggested technique. The findings show that our suggested strategy classified 15,000 cases with a high accuracy of 98.2%</description>
