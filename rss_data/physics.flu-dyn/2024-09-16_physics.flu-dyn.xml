      <title>Principles of hydrodynamic particle manipulation in internal Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation of small-scale particles across streamlines is the elementary task of microfluidic devices. Many such devices operate at very low Reynolds numbers and deflect particles using arrays of obstacles, but a systematic quantification of relevant hydrodynamic effects has been lacking. Here, we explore an alternate approach, rigorously modeling the displacement of force-free spherical particles in vortical Stokes flows under hydrodynamic particle-wall interaction. Certain Moffatt-like eddy geometries with broken symmetry allow for systematic deflection of particles across streamlines, leading to particle accumulation at either Faxen field fixed points or limit cycles. Moreover, particles can be forced onto trajectories approaching channel walls exponentially closely, making quantitative predictions of particle capture (sticking) by short-range forces possible. This rich, particle size-dependent behavior suggests the versatile use of inertial-less flow in devices with a long particle residence time for concentration, sorting, or filtering.</description>

      <title>Covariant algebraic Reynolds stress modelling of curvature effects in high-Reynolds-number Taylor--Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly constant mean angular momentum profiles are widely observed in curved turbulent flows, including the bulk region of Taylor--Couette (TC) flows, where the inner and outer cylinders have weakly counter-rotating and co-rotating conditions. For high-Reynolds-number TC flows under these conditions, both the bulk and boundary layers become turbulent without Taylor rolls, referred to as the featureless ultimate regime (UR). In this study, we examine Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models to predict the nearly constant mean angular velocity as a one-dimensional problem in the featureless UR of TC turbulence. High-Reynolds-number experiments of TC turbulence are performed for reference, where the radius ratio is $\eta = r_\mathrm{in}/r_\mathrm{out} = 0.732$ and angular velocity ratio $a = -\omega_\mathrm{out}/\omega_\mathrm{in}$ is in the range $-0.5 \le a \le 0.1$. Verification of the RANS model using the algebraic Reynolds stress model (ARSM) suggests that convection of the Reynolds stress is essential for predicting the angular momentum profile. We introduce the Jaumann derivative as a covariant time derivative to develop ARSMs that incorporate the convection effect in a covariant manner. The proposed ARSM using the Jaumann derivative of the term composed of the strain and vorticity tensors successfully predicts the nearly constant mean angular momentum for a wide range of angular velocity ratios in the co-rotating case. The modelling approach incorporating time-derivative terms is a candidate for expressing curvature effects while satisfying the covariance of the Reynolds stress tensor.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of an oscillating cylinder inline with steady current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wake and force characteristics of an oscillating cylinder in inline steady currents are investigated numerically over a wide parameter space of dimensionless oscillation amplitude ($A^* = 0.01 - 0.50$) and wavelength ($\lambda^* = 0.4 - 25$) at a fixed Reynolds number $Re = 500$. Fundamental issues addressed in this study are the interactions of wakes induced by steady approaching flow and cylinder oscillations and the influences of the governing parameters of $A^$ and $\lambda^$ on such interactions. Whilst the collinear flow is dominated by wakes induced by cylinder oscillation at $\lambda^* \leq 1.5$ and steady current at $\lambda^* \geq 10$, it exhibits characteristics of nonlinear interactions of wakes induced by the cylinder oscillation and steady current at $\lambda^* = 1.5 - 10$, such as the formation of multiple synchronized modes interleaved with desynchronized modes. The synchronized mode varies with both $\lambda^$ and $A^$, forming an inclined Arnold's tongue across $\lambda^-A^$ space. There is a wide variability of the vortex shedding pattern in each synchronized mode. Variations of different hydrodynamic force coefficients with $\lambda^$ and $A^$ are investigated with physical interpretations based on the wake characteristics. The applicability of the Morison equation in predicting inline force fluctuations is examined. We found that the Morison equation shows reasonable accuracy only for a small range of $\lambda^* \leq 1.5$. Beyond this range, its performance deteriorates due to the influence of steady current on wake characteristics.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically buoyantly driven and are strongly constrained by planetary rotation at large scales. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory studies of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation (Ekman numbers $\rm Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $\rm Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are significantly smaller. Reduced equations of motion, the non-hydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations describing the leading-order behavior in the limit of rapid rotation ($\rm Ek \to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, leaving the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $\rm Ek$ currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE), a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $\rm Ek\to 0$. We provide the first full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $\rm Ek=10^{-15}$ and below and show that the RiNSE converge to the asymptotically reduced equations.</description>

      <title>The stability of stratified horizontal flows of carbon dioxide at supercritical pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids at supercritical pressures exhibit large variations in density near the pseudo critical line, such that buoyancy plays a crucial role in their fluid dynamics. Here, we experimentally investigate heat transfer and turbulence in horizontal hydrodynamically developed channel flows of carbon dioxide at 88.5 bar and 32.6{\deg}C, heated at either the top or bottom surface to induce a strong vertical density gradient. In order to visualise the flow and evaluate its heat transfer, shadowgraphy is used concurrently with surface temperature measurements. With moderate heating, the flow is found to strongly stratify for both heating configurations, with bulk Richardson numbers Ri reaching up to 100. When the carbon dioxide is heated from the bottom upwards, the resulting unstably stratified flow is found to be dominated by the increasingly prevalent secondary motion of thermal plumes, enhancing vertical mixing and progressively improving heat transfer compared to a neutrally buoyant setting. Conversely, stable stratification, induced by heating from the top, suppresses the vertical motion leading to deteriorated heat transfer that becomes invariant to the Reynolds number. The optical results provide novel insights into the complex dynamics of the directionally dependent heat transfer in the near-pseudo-critical region. These insights contribute to the reliable design of heat exchangers with highly property-variant fluids, which are critical for the decarbonisation of power and industrial heat. However, the results also highlight the need for further progress in the development of experimental techniques to generate reliable reference data for a broader range of non-ideal supercritical conditions.</description>

      <title>A novel volume of fluid ghost-cell immersed boundary method for free surface flow interacting with structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel volume of fluid ghost-cell immersed boundary (IB) method for two-phase free surface flow interacting with structures. To circumvent the disturbance occurring around the intersection area of the IB and free surface when using the interpolation method for variable reconstruction, the fluid-structure interaction is firstly considered with the orthogonal IB by mimicking the imposition of boundary conditions in the body-conformal grid method. Treatments are subsequently performed to account for the non-orthogonal effect in accurately simulating the FSI, including the newly proposed flux-scaling and IB velocity re-evaluation methods. Further, a variable smoothing process and a flux correction method are adapted to handle moving boundary cases. Based on OpenFOAM, a two-phase flow solver has been developed. Both stationary and moving immersed boundary cases are used for validations. The numerical results reasonably agree with the corresponding laboratory data and other numerical simulation results, demonstrating the disturbance being effectively depressed and the solver's accuracy in capturing fluid-structure interactions involving free surface flow.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for tracking a moving target in jellyfish-like swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning method for training a jellyfish-like swimmer to effectively track a moving target in a two-dimensional flow. This swimmer is a flexible object equipped with a muscle model based on torsional springs. We employ a deep Q-network (DQN) that takes the swimmer's geometry and dynamic parameters as inputs, and outputs actions which are the forces applied to the swimmer. In particular, we introduce an action regulation to mitigate the interference from complex fluid-structure interactions. The goal of these actions is to navigate the swimmer to a target point in the shortest possible time. In the DQN training, the data on the swimmer's motions are obtained from simulations conducted using the immersed boundary method. During tracking a moving target, there is an inherent delay between the application of forces and the corresponding response of the swimmer's body due to hydrodynamic interactions between the shedding vortices and the swimmer's own locomotion. Our tests demonstrate that the swimmer, with the DQN agent and action regulation, is able to dynamically adjust its course based on its instantaneous state. This work extends the application scope of machine learning in controlling flexible objects within fluid environments.</description>

      <title>On the performances of standard and kinetic energy preserving time-integration methods for incompressible-flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of kinetic-energy preservation errors due to Runge-Kutta (RK) temporal integrators have been analyzed for the case of large-eddy simulations of incompressible turbulent channel flow. Simulations have been run using the open-source solver Xcompact3D with an implicit spectral vanishing viscosity model and a variety of temporal Runge-Kutta integrators. Explicit pseudo-symplectic schemes, with improved energy preservation properties, have been compared to standard RK methods. The results show a marked decrease in the temporal error for higher-order pseudo-symplectic methods; on the other hand, an analysis of the energy spectra indicates that the dissipation introduced by the commonly used three-stage RK scheme can lead to significant distortion of the energy distribution within the inertial range. A cost-vs-accuracy analysis suggests that pseudo-symplectic schemes could be used to attain results comparable to traditional methods at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Event-based reconstruction of time-resolved centreline deformation of flapping flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed imaging is central to the experimental investigation of fast phenomena, like flapping flags. Event-based cameras use new types of sensors that address typical challenges such as low illumination conditions, large data transfer, and the trade-off between increasing repetition rate and measurement duration more efficiently and at reduced costs compared to classical frame-based fast cameras. Event-based cameras output unstructured data that frame-based algorithms can not process. This paper proposes a general method to reconstruct the motion of a slender object similar to the centreline of a flapping flag from raw streams of event data. Our algorithm relies on a coarse chain-like structure that encodes the current state of the line and is updated by the occurrence of new events. The algorithm is applied to synthetic data, generated from known motions, to demonstrate that the method is accurate up to one percent of error for tip-based, shape-based, and modal decomposition metrics. Degradation of the reconstruction accuracy due to simulated defects only occurs when the defect intensities become more than two orders of magnitude larger than the values expected in experiments. The algorithm is then applied to experimental data of flapping flags, and we obtain relative errors below one percent when comparing the results with the data from laser distance sensors. The reconstruction of line deformation from event-based data is accurate and robust, and unlocks the ability to perform autonomous measurements in experimental mechanics.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies.</description>

Abstract: Study of the locomotion of a centipede (L. forficatus) at the air-water interface reveals that it does not predominantly use its 14 leg pairs to locomote; unlike most swimmers which propagate head-to-tail body bending waves, this species propels via tail-to-head waves. Its low mass and body-fluid contact yield locomotion dynamics in which fluid wave drag forces dominate inertia. Microorganism-inspired wave drag resistive force theory captures swimming performance of the macroscale animal, motivating a control hypothesis for the animals self-propulsion body and limb kinematics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Transonic Flows around an Airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have gained popularity as a deep-learning based method for solving problems governed by partial differential equations. Especially for engineering applications, this new method seems to be promising since it can solve parametric problems. Therefore, a single neural network could substitute many classical simulations in parameter studies. The simulation of inviscid, compressible flows around an airfoil, has been a challenging task for classical numerical methods for many decades and is relevant for industrial applications to this day. Only recently, researchers have been able to successfully simulate subsonic flows around an airfoil with physics-informed neural networks by utilizing mesh transformations to precondition the optimization problem that needs to be solved. Here, we extend this methodology into the transonic regime. Previous attempts showed difficulties to capture the normal shock waves that occur at these flow conditions. Inspired by classical numerical methods, we introduce an analytic sensor function that locally introduces artificial viscosity at the shock locations to stabilize the training process. We validate the method at different transonic flow conditions for the NACA0012 airfoil, obtaining errors of less than one percent, compared to finite volume simulations. In addition we show how a parametric model can approximate the solution in a continuous range of angle of attacks. The presented method could help to pave the way for physics-informed neural networks towards industrial applications in aerodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sorting elongated anisotropic particles, such as fibers, dispersed in suspensions poses significant challenges as they present two characteristic dimensions: length and diameter. Fibers in suspension usually align with the flow, leading to diameter-based filtration when passing through a sieve. Modifying the flow conditions by introducing more mixing so that fibers are arbitrarily oriented can lead to sorting by diameter and length simultaneously, resulting in a lower filtration quality. In this paper, we demonstrate that capillary filtration by dip coating can be utilized to selectively sort fibers by length or by diameter in a controlled manner. Using the withdrawal of a flat substrate from a fiber suspension, we demonstrate that fibers are primarily sorted by their diameters. When considering cylindrical substrates, fibers can be sorted by length under appropriate conditions due to the orientation adopted by the fibers during their entrainment. We report guidelines for designing this filtration process and obtaining good sorting efficiency.</description>
