      <title>Diff-FlowFSI: A GPU-Optimized Differentiable CFD Platform for High-Fidelity Turbulence and FSI Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows and fluid-structure interactions (FSI) are ubiquitous in scientific and engineering applications, but their accurate and efficient simulation remains a major challenge due to strong nonlinearities, multiscale interactions, and high computational demands. Traditional CFD solvers, though effective, struggle with scalability and adaptability for tasks such as inverse modeling, optimization, and data assimilation. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have inspired hybrid modeling approaches that integrate neural networks with physics-based solvers to enhance generalization and capture unresolved dynamics. However, realizing this integration requires solvers that are not only physically accurate but also differentiable and GPU-efficient. In this work, we introduce Diff-FlowFSI, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable CFD platform designed for high-fidelity turbulence and FSI simulations. Implemented in JAX, Diff-FlowFSI features a vectorized finite volume solver combined with the immersed boundary method to handle complex geometries and fluid-structure coupling. The platform enables GPU-enabled fast forward simulations, supports automatic differentiation for gradient-based inverse problems, and integrates seamlessly with deep learning components for hybrid neural-CFD modeling. We validate Diff-FlowFSI across a series of benchmark turbulence and FSI problems, demonstrating its capability to accelerate scientific computing at the intersection of physics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Extracting dominant dynamics about unsteady base flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of techniques exist for extracting the dominant flow dynamics and features about steady, or periodic base flows. However, there have been limited efforts in extracting the dominant dynamics about unsteady, aperiodic base flow. These flows appear in many applications such as when there is a sudden change in the flow rate through a pipe, when an airfoil experiences stall, or when a vortex forms. For these unsteady flows, it is valuable to know not only the dynamics of the base flow but also the features that form around this base flow. Here, we discuss the current state of research on extracting important flow structures and their dynamics in such cases with time-varying base flows. In particular, we consider data-driven decompositions, operator-based methods, causality analysis, and some other approaches. We also offer an outlook and call attention to key areas that require future efforts.</description>

      <title>The 'Brazil-nut effect' in bidisperse particle laden flow on an incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bidisperse suspensions -- suspensions where there are two particle species of the same density but different sizes -- of a viscous fluid on an incline. We use a lubrication theory/thin film model to form a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws for the height and particle volume fractions. The model predicts, over a range of parameters, that the larger particles rise to the top of the layer, consistent with the well-known `Brazil-nut effect' for granular media. The model predicts well-separated fronts of the two species of particles, behind a clear fluid front, at lower inclination angles and volume fractions. This corresponds to a triple shock structure in the system of conservations. At higher inclination angles and volume fractions the particles congregate at a high concentration at the leading front corresponding to a singular shock in the model. We find excellent agreement between theory and experiments in terms of the overall dynamic structures as the parameters vary.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic machine learning for time-varying mode decomposition of separated airfoil wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated wakes around a wing. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012 airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2. strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of unsteady aerodynamic problems.</description>

      <title>A Method for Analytical Solutions in the Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical solutions to the lattice Boltzmann Equation make it possible to study the method itself, explore the properties of its collision operator, and identify implementations of boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a method to find analytical solutions where the macroscopic flow profile is known. We test this method on bulk Couette flow aligned and inclined to the simulation lattice with the quadratic and entropic equilibrium distributions. Our method indeed provides an analytical solution to these flows when using the quadratic distribution. When the flow is aligned to the lattice, our method provides an analytical solution using the entropic distribution for practical relaxation times and shear rates. We show that a small even order truncation of the formal solution is optimal for accuracy-compute-time trade-off. In the inclined case, our method does not conserve momentum, by a small relative error, when using the entropic distribution. We also discover that entropic lattice Boltzmann method is not compatible with the angled Couette flow. We discuss the application of our method to more complicated flows.</description>

      <title>Newtonian-like behavior of starting vortex flow in superfluid helium at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally the starting vortices shed by airfoils accelerating uniformly from rest in superfluid helium-4 (He II). The vortices behave apparently as if they were moving in a classical Newtonian fluid, such as air or water. Specifically, the starting vortex positions obtained from the experimental data are found to be very close to those computed numerically in a Newtonian fluid, at sufficiently small times, when self-similar behavior is expected to occur, and for Reynolds numbers ranging approximately between $5 \times 10^2$ and $5 \times 10^5$. The result indicates neatly that turbulent flows of He II can be very similar to classical flows of Newtonian fluids, when thermal effects can be neglected and at sufficiently large flow scales, i.e. the study demonstrates that superfluid helium-4 could also be employed to study classical Newtonian flows.</description>

      <title>Wall roughness and viscous dissipation effects in microchannel heat sinks with semicircular cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical analysis of the wall roughness effect is carried out to determine the impact of the shape uncertainty on the Poiseuille number and Nusselt number of laminar forced convection. The focus is on the fully developed regime in a semicircular microchannel where the heat transfer occurs from the diametrical plane boundary, modelled as a perfectly smooth surface. On the other hand, the curved semicircular boundary is devised as rough and with a negligible wall heat flux. Three types of thermal boundary conditions are implemented: the T condition, the H1 condition and the H2 condition. The T condition serves to model a case where the fluid temperature does not undergo any change in the streamwise direction, while the H1 and H2 conditions are employed to describe a net heating of the fluid. A statistical sample of several different rough microchannels is used to detect the actual effects of roughness on the Poiseuille number and on the Nusselt number, through the evaluation of their average values and standard deviations. The governing local momentum and energy balance equations are solved numerically by a finite element method taking into account the viscous dissipation contribution to the local energy balance.</description>

      <title>A Standing-Wave Model for the Low-Frequency Dynamics of a Turbulent Separation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the low-frequency dynamics of a turbulent separation bubble (TSB) forming over a backward-facing ramp, with a focus on very-large-scale coherent structures associated with the so-called 'breathing motion'. Using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) in both streamwise and spanwise planes, we examine the role of sidewall confinement, an aspect largely overlooked in previous research. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of the streamwise velocity field reveals a dominant low-rank mode at very low Strouhal numbers ($St =$ 0.01-0.05), consistent with prior observations of TSB breathing. Strikingly, the spanwise-oriented PIV data uncover a previously unreported standing wave pattern, characterized by discrete spanwise wavenumbers and nodal/antinodal structures, suggesting the presence of spanwise resonance. To explain these observations, we construct a resolvent-based model that imposes free-slip conditions at the sidewall locations by superposing left- and right-traveling three-dimensional modes. The model accurately reproduces the spanwise structure and frequency content of the measured SPOD modes, demonstrating that sidewall reflections lead to the formation of standing wave-like patterns. The analysis further indicates that the observed dynamics are caused by the lift-up mechanism driving the formation of large-scale streaks that span the domain width. Our findings highlight the critical influence of spanwise boundary conditions on the selection and structure of low-frequency modes in TSBs. This has direct implications for both experimental and numerical studies, particularly those relying on spanwise-periodic boundary conditions, and offers a low-order framework for predicting sidewall-induced modal dynamics in separated flows.</description>

      <title>Cone-jet Stokes solutions in strong viscous flows: the vanishing flow rate limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady tip streaming in the vanishing flow rate limit has been evidenced both experimentally and numerically in the literature. However, local conical Stokes flow solutions supporting these results at vanishing small scales around the emitting tip have remained elusive. This work presents approximate local conical solutions in liquid-liquid flow focusing and tip streaming, in general, as the limit of a macroscopic vanishing issued flow rate. This provides mathematical foundations for the existence of an asymptotically vanishing scale at the tip of an intermediate conical flow geometry with angle $\alpha$. For a sufficiently small inner-to-outer liquid viscosity ratio $\lambda$, these solutions exhibit a universal power-law relationship between this ratio and the cone angle as $\alpha=k \lambda^{1/2}$, where the prefactor $k$, of the order of unity, depends on the geometric details of the macroscopic flow. This confirms the existing proposals that anticipate the use of flow focusing and tip streaming technologies for tight control of microscopic scales, down to those where diffuse liquid-liquid interfaces become manifested.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive regularized score-based diffusion models for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in scientific machine learning and generative modeling for computational fluid dynamics, we propose a conditional score-based diffusion model designed for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction. Our model integrates an energy constraint rooted in the statistical properties of turbulent flows, improving prediction quality with minimal training, while enabling efficient sampling at low cost. The method features a simple and general architecture that requires no problem-specific design, supports plug-and-play enhancements, and enables fast and flexible solution generation. It also demonstrates an efficient conditioning mechanism that simplifies training across different scenarios without demanding a redesign of existing models. We further explore various stochastic differential equation formulations to demonstrate how thoughtful design choices enhance performance. We validate the proposed methodology through extensive experiments on complex fluid dynamics datasets encompassing a variety of flow regimes and configurations. Results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves stable, robust, and physically faithful predictions, even under challenging turbulent conditions. With properly tuned parameters, it achieves accurate results across multiple scenarios while preserving key physical and statistical properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of stochastic differential equation impact and discuss our approach across diverse fluid mechanics tasks.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical (finite-amplitude) dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore subcritical convective dynamo action in a spherical shell, using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic field generation. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first approaching an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion and Decay of an Expanding Turbulent Blob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence, left unforced, decays and invades the surrounding quiescent fluid. Though ubiquitous, this simple phenomenon has proven hard to capture within a simple and general framework. Experiments in conventional turbulent flow chambers are inevitably complicated by proximity to boundaries and mean flow, obscuring the fundamental aspects of the relaxation to the quiescent fluid state. Here, we circumvent these issues by creating a spatially-localized blob of turbulent fluid using eight converging vortex generators focused towards the center of a tank of water, and observe its decay and spread over decades in time, using particle image velocimetry with a logarithmic sampling rate. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret these dynamics within the framework of a nonlinear diffusion equation, which predicts that the ideal quiescent-turbulent fluid boundary is sharp and propagates non-diffusively, driven by turbulent eddies while decaying with characteristic scaling laws. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe, in contrast to earlier studies. Our work provides a detailed spatially-resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.</description>
