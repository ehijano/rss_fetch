      <title>Biomechanical Mapping of Tumor Growth: A Novel Method to Quantify Glioma Infiltration and Mass Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits two principal growth phenotypes: infiltrative, characterized by diffuse invasion with minimal mass effect, and proliferative, characterized by pronounced tissue compression. Their quantitative delineation and prognostic implications remain uncertain. We introduce an MRI-derived biomarker, the dynamic infiltration rate (DIR), defined as the ratio of tumor-volume expansion to mass-effect--induced peritumoral compression, and evaluate it in silico and clinically. In a synthetic dataset spanning realistic infiltrative-proliferative spectra, DIR correlates strongly with ground truth ($R^{2}=0.85$). Applied to patient data, a data-driven threshold separates high- and low-infiltration groups with markedly different overall survival (median 16.0 versus 35.2 weeks; log-rank $p&lt;0.001$; hazard ratio 2.49). Multivariate Cox analysis adjusted for age, sex, and MGMT status confirms DIR as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; $p=0.0027$). DIR therefore differentiates proliferative from infiltrative GBM phenotypes and provides prognostic information that could inform personalized therapy and follow-up.</description>

      <title>MR sequence design to account for non-ideal gradient performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17575</link>

Abstract: MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process typically happens invisibly to the pulse sequence designer, allowing them to assume the achieved gradient waveform will be as desired. Whilst convenient, this imposes stricter limits on sequence design than the hardware can handle (e.g. pre-emphasis adds an extra overhead to the waveforms). This strategy is particularly undesirable for lower performance or resource-limited hardware. Instead, we propose a 'non-ideal system optimization' (NISO) method to design pre-compensated gradient waveforms that: (i) explicitly respect hardware constraints and (ii) improve imaging performance by correcting k-space samples directly. Gradient waveforms are numerically optimized by including a model for system imperfections. This is first investigated in simulation using an exponential eddy current model, then experimentally using an empirical gradient system transfer function. NISO discovers solutions that simultaneously produce negligible reconstruction errors and satisfy gradient system limits, even when classic pre-emphasis produces infeasible results. Experimentally, NISO substantially reduced artefacts in both phantom and in vivo echo planar images on a 7T MR scanner. NISO designs MR pulse sequences for imperfect hardware. This work demonstrates that prospective correction of EPI sequences is possible given a model for system imperfections. We envisage that NISO could enable more efficient hardware usage and this may prove particularly important for maximizing imaging performance of lower-cost systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Chebyshev Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Equilibrium Model in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</description>
