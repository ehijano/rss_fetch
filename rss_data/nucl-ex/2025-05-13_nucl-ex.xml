      <title>Dielectron measurements in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies with the STAR experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectrons, emitted during the evolution of the hot and dense QCD medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, offer an effective probe of the hot medium properties, as they do not involve strong interactions. The dielectron emission rate is proportional to the medium's electromagnetic spectral function. In the dielectron mass range from 400 to 800 MeV/$c^2$, the spectral function probes the in-medium $\rho$ meson propagator which is sensitive to the medium's properties including the total baryon density and the temperature. By measuring thermal dielectron production, we can study the microscopic interactions between the electromagnetic current and the medium. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program provides a unique opportunity to systematically study dielectron production in a collision energy range where the total baryon density and temperatures are varying substantially. In these proceedings, STAR measurements of thermal electrons produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6 and 19.6 GeV will be reported. The results will include the thermal dielectron spectra, differential/total excess yield, and the temperature extracted from the low invariant mass range, as well as their collision energy dependence.</description>

      <title>The 76Cu conundrum remains unsolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near the doubly-magic nucleus \nuc{Ni}{78} ($Z=28$, $N=50$), there has been a decades-long debate on the existence of a long-lived isomer in \nuc{Cu}{76}. A recent mass measurement claimed to have settled the debate, by measuring the energy of the isomer and shedding light on the structure of the nucleus. In this work, we present new, more accurate, and precise values of the half-lives of the isomeric and ground states in \nuc{Cu}{76}. Our findings suggest that both states have very similar half-lives, in the 600-700 ms range, in disagreement with the literature values, implying that they cannot be differentiated by their decay curves. These results raise more questions than they answer, reopening the debate and showing that the structures in \nuc{Cu}{76} are still not fully understood.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the non-spin- and spin-transfer isovector responses via the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(^{10}\mathrm{Be},{}^{10}\mathrm{B}+\gamma)^{12}\mathrm{B}$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isovector response in $^{12}$B was investigated via the $^{12}$C($^{10}\mathrm{Be}$,$^{10}\mathrm{B}$+$\gamma$) reaction at $100 A \, \mathrm{MeV}$. By utilizing the $\gamma$-decay properties of the 1.74 MeV $0^{+}$ and 0.718 MeV $1^{+}$ states in $^{10}\mathrm{B}$, the separate extraction of the non-spin-transfer ($\Delta S=0$) and spin-transfer ($\Delta S=1$) isovector responses up to an excitation energy of 50 MeV in $^{12}$B in a single experiment is demonstrated. The experimental setup employed the S800 spectrometer to detect and analyze the $^{10}\mathrm{B}$ ejectiles and the Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Nuclear Array (GRETINA) for obtaining the Doppler-reconstructed spectrum for $\gamma$-rays emitted in-flight by $^{10}\mathrm{B}$. Contributions from transitions associated with the transfer of different units of angular momentum in the non-spin- and spin-transfer responses were analyzed using a multipole decomposition analysis. The extracted non-spin-dipole ($\Delta S=0$, $\Delta L=1$) and spin-dipole ($\Delta S=1$, $\Delta L=1$) responses were found to be consistent with available data from other charge-exchange probes, validating the non-spin- and spin-transfer filters used. While statistical uncertainties and experimental resolutions were relatively large due to the modest intensity of the $^{10}\mathrm{Be}$ secondary beam, the results show that, with the much higher intensities that will be available at new rare-isotope beam facilities, the ($^{10}\mathrm{Be}$,$^{10}\mathrm{B}$+$\gamma$) reaction and its $\Delta T_{z}=-1$ partner, the ($^{10}$C,$^{10}\mathrm{B}$+$\gamma$) reaction, are powerful tools for elucidating the isovector non-spin- and spin-transfer responses in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of baryon dynamics with directed flow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis aims to elucidate the role of initial baryon stopping and its diffusion in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) using hydrodynamic model. In this regard, we have studied the observable-directed flow ($v_1$) of identified hadrons, particularly the $v_1$ of baryons and antibaryons, as well as the splitting observed between them in detail. We propose a new ansatz for the initial baryon distribution. By employing this initial baryon deposition model alongside a tilted energy distribution as inputs to a hybrid framework, we successfully describe the rapidity-odd $v_1$ of identified hadrons, including the elusive baryon-antibaryon splitting of $v_1$ across a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Our model, incorporating baryon stopping and it's subsequent diffusion within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework and employing a crossover equation of state derived from lattice QCD calculations, establishes a non-critical baryonic baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate that recent STAR measurements of the centrality and system-size dependence of $v_1$ splitting between oppositely charged hadrons-attributed to electromagnetic field effects-are significantly influenced by background contributions from baryon stopping and its diffusion. Furthermore, we show that the rapidity dependence of the splitting of the rapidity-even component of $v_1$ between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ is highly sensitive to the initial baryon deposition scheme. If measured experimentally, this could constraint the rapidity dependence of the initial baryon deposition profile. Moreover, it could offer valuable phenomenological insights into the baryon junction picture and help refine constraints on the baryon diffusion coefficient of the medium. Notably, utilizing this phenomenologically successful baryon deposition model, we present the first estimation of the baryon diffusion coefficient for the strongly interacting QCD matter created in HIC.</description>

      <title>Continuum Lambda spectra for a 6Li_Lambda hypernucleus in the 6Li(K-, pi-) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Lambda production via a (K-, pi-) reaction on a 6Li target, using the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) with a Fermi-averaged K-n --&gt; pi-Lambda amplitude. We calculate Lambda production spectra using the Green's function method for a 5Li nuclear core + Lambda system, employing a Lambda folding-model potential based on the 5Li nuclear density, which is constructed from alpha-p and 3He-d cluster wave functions. The results show that the calculated spectrum, which includes Lambda bound, resonance, and continuum states, agrees well with the experimental data from the (K-, pi-) reaction at p_K- = 790 MeV/c (0 deg.), where substitutional (0p_Lambda, 0p^{-1}_n) and (0s_Lambda, 0s^{-1}_n) configurations dominate in the near-recoilless reactions. A narrow peak corresponds to a high-lying excited state with spin-parity J^P= 1+ at E_Lambda= 13.8 MeV near the 3He + d + Lambda threshold, arising from interference effects between 5Li(3/2+)x(0s1/2)_Lambda and 5Li(1/2+)x(0s1/2)_Lambda components. This study offers a valuable framework for extracting essential information on the structure and production mechanisms of hypernuclear states from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Violation of NCQ scaling in hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-7.7 \,\mathrm{GeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow for various hadrons in non-central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0\text{--}7.7\,\mathrm{GeV}$ using the AMPT model with string melting (SM) and pure hadron cascade (HC) modes. For the SM case, NCQ scaling is absent at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}$ but is largely restored by $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.9\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Although quark coalescence occurs at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}$, the lack of NCQ scaling is attributed to the insufficient development of quark elliptic flow and the limited production of strange quarks and antiquarks. This finding suggests that NCQ scaling could not be considered a definitive signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in the RHIC fixed-target energy region. For the HC case, as expected, no NCQ scaling is observed. However, a mass ordering in the elliptic flow emerges at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =4.5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, indicating that full thermalization may not be a prerequisite for mass ordering.</description>

      <title>A two-stage time-stretching TDC with discrete components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and testing of a time-stretching-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented with discrete components. The TDC utilizes capacitor charging and discharging to achieve a time resolution of under 100 ps using a 100 MHz clock counter on a low-power, low-cost FPGA, achieving a time amplification factor of over 100. A two-stage time-stretching architecture is employed to reduce the conversion time to below 300 ns for a 10 ns input range. An onboard calibration system, including a pulse generation circuit, is implemented, and calibration results are presented. This system serves as a proof-of-concept platform for circuit optimization toward an ASIC implementation of a front-end TDC targeting future 4D pixel detectors at hadron colliders, with goals of sub-50 ps resolution and power consumption at the $\mu$W/channel level. Additionally, the design offers a modular, low-cost solution for extracting signal arrival times with 100 ps precision in particle physics experiments, such as photoelectron timing extraction for photodetector readout in neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei Femtoscopy and Baryon Interactions in 3 GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the measurements of proton-deuteron ($p$-$d$) and deuteron-deuteron ($d$-$d$) correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3 GeV using fixed-target mode with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). For the first time, the source size ($R_{G}$), scattering length ($f_{0}$), and effective range ($d_{0}$) are extracted from the measured correlation functions with a simultaneous fit. The spin-averaged $f_0$ for $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ interactions are determined to be -5.28 $\pm$ 0.11(stat.) $\pm$ 0.82(syst.) fm and -2.62 $\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\pm$ 0.24(syst.) fm, respectively. The measured $p$-$d$ interaction is consistent with theoretical calculations and low-energy scattering experiment results, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting interaction parameters using the femtoscopy technique. The reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the calculations from the transport model indicates that deuteron production in these collisions is primarily governed by nucleon coalescence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the internal three-dimensional quark and gluon structures of hadrons through generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from hard exclusive scattering processes is one of the most challenging tasks in nuclear and particle physics. In this paper, we introduce a new optimized reference frame that, for the first time, enables a unified view of all the reactions sensitive to GPDs and facilitates the interpretation of a variety of phase-space patterns that were previously hardly accessible and interpretable. Similarly to how the heliocentric description advanced our understanding of the solar system and gravitation, our new frame centers around a quasireal state, allows for a consistent separation of physical scales, and reveals a novel quantum interference mechanism.</description>

      <title>Long term remote reactor power and fuel composition monitoring using antineutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron antineutrinos are emitted in the decay chains of the fission products inside a reactor core and could be used for remote monitoring of nuclear reactors. The DANSS detector is placed under the core of the 3.1 GW power reactor at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) and collects up to 5000 antineutrino events per day. DANSS measured changes of the reactor power by antineutrino counting rates over 7 years with 1.0% accuracy in one week periods. The fission fractions of four major isotopes for the reactor power calculations were provided by KNPP. The systematic uncertainty of this measurement is less than 0.8%. It is comparable to the accuracy of conventional methods of the reactor power measurements while it is based on completely different approach. For the first time the 239Pu and 235U fission fractions were reconstructed using antineutrino inverse beta-decay spectrum which is a completely new technique. This method was applied to the data from three reactor fuel campaigns (approximately 1.5 year each). The reconstructed fission fractions in about two-week measurements and the fission fractions provided by KNPP coincide within better than 3% accuracy. This provides confidence in both completely different approaches of the fission fraction determination.</description>

      <title>Deuterium-deuterium fusion charged particle detection using CR-39 and Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors are widely used in fusion research for detecting charged particles produced in fusion reactions. However, analyzing increasingly complex and large-scale CR-39 track images to extract meaningful information can be a tedious and time-consuming process, often prone to human errors and bias. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-based classification model capable of differentiating protons, tritons, and helions produced during D-D fusion, using CR-39 track images as input data. The CR-39 track images were processed and used to train a deep learning model. By preprocessing the track images for noise reduction and feature enhancement, we trained the YOLOv8 [1][2] network to distinguish the three particle types with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of over 96%, demonstrating its potential for improving automated track analysis in CR-39 detectors. Additionally, the model precisely identifies particle coordinates and counts, enabling comprehensive particle analysis. This study highlights the application of AI in track detection and classification, offering a robust solution for particle identification in CR-39 detector-based experiments.</description>

Abstract: We report on empirical parameterizations of longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic form factors for elastic scattering and the excitations of nuclear states in ${\rm ^{27}Al}$ and ${\rm ^{40}Ca}$. The parameterizations are needed for the calculations of radiative corrections in measurements of electron scattering cross sections on ${\rm ^{27}Al}$ and ${\rm ^{40}Ca}$ in the quasi-elastic, resonance and inelastic continuum regions, provide the contribution of nuclear excitations in investigations of the Coulomb Sum Rule, and test theoretical model predictions for excitation of nuclear states in electron and neutrino interactions on nuclear targets at low energies.</description>

      <title>Manifest Gauge Invariance for Structure Dependent Radiative Corrections to Processes Involving Atoms and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to reactions involving atoms or nuclei can become sensitive to the structure of the bound state. Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.</description>
