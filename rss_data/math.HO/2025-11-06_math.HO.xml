      <title>Carl St{\o}rmer and his Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</description>

      <title>Huygens and $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens refined Archimedes' celebrated geometrical computation of $\pi$ to its highest point. Yet the rich content of his beautiful treatise \emph{De circuli magnitudine inventa} (1654) has apparently never been presented in modern form. Here we offer a detailed and contemporary development of several of his most striking results. We also make a historical conjecture concerning Archimedes' trisection figure.</description>

Abstract: In this arxiv-post I present my solutions (published or not) to Problems that appeared in Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Magazine, Elemente der Mathematik and CRUX, that were mostly done in collaboration with Rudolf Rupp. Some of them (including a few own proposals which were published) were also done in cooperation with Rainer Br\"uck, Bikash Chakraborty, Pamela Gorkin, Gerd Herzog, J\'er\^ome No\"el, Peter Pflug and Amol Sasane.</description>

      <title>On unsolvable equations of prime degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kronecker observed that either all roots or only one root of a solvable irreducible equation of odd prime degree with integer coefficients are real. This gives a possibility to construct specific examples of equations not solvable by radicals. A relatively elementary proof without using the full power of Galois theory is due to Weber. We give a rather short proof of Kronecker's theorem with a slightly different argument from Weber's. Several modern presentations of Weber's proof contain inaccuracies, which can be traced back to an error in the original proof. We discuss this error and how it can be corrected.</description>
