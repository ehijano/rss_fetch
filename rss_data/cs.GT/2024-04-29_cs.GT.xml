      <title>The Division Problem of Chances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frequently repeated matching scenarios, individuals may require diversification in their choices. Therefore, when faced with a set of potential outcomes, each individual may have an ideal lottery over outcomes that represents their preferred option. This suggests that, as people seek variety, their favorite choice is not a particular outcome, but rather a lottery over them as their peak for their preferences.
  We explore matching problems in situations where agents' preferences are represented by ideal lotteries. Our focus lies in addressing the challenge of dividing chances in matching, where agents express their preferences over a set of objects through ideal lotteries that reflect their single-peaked preferences.
  We discuss properties such as strategy proofness, replacement monotonicity, (Pareto) efficiency, in-betweenness, non-bossiness, envy-freeness, and anonymity in the context of dividing chances, and propose a class of mechanisms called URC mechanisms that satisfy these properties. Subsequently, we prove that if a mechanism for dividing chances is strategy proof, (Pareto) efficient, replacement monotonic, in-between, non-bossy, and anonymous (or envy free), then it is equivalent in terms of welfare to a URC mechanism.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterizations for these extensions.</description>

      <title>Merchants of Vulnerabilities: How Bug Bounty Programs Benefit Software Vendors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities enable exploitation by malicious hackers, compromising systems and data security. This paper examines bug bounty programs (BBPs) that incentivize ethical hackers to discover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to software vendors. Using game-theoretic models, we capture the strategic interactions between software vendors, ethical hackers, and malicious hackers. First, our analysis shows that software vendors can increase expected profits by participating in BBPs, explaining their growing adoption and the success of BBP platforms. Second, we find that vendors with BBPs will release software earlier, albeit with more potential vulnerabilities, as BBPs enable coordinated vulnerability disclosure and mitigation. Third, the optimal number of ethical hackers to invite to a BBP depends solely on the expected number of malicious hackers seeking exploitation. This optimal number of ethical hackers is lower than but increases with the expected malicious hacker count. Finally, higher bounties incentivize ethical hackers to exert more effort, thereby increasing the probability that they will discover severe vulnerabilities first while reducing the success probability of malicious hackers. These findings highlight BBPs' potential benefits for vendors beyond profitability. Earlier software releases are enabled by managing risks through coordinated disclosure. As cybersecurity threats evolve, BBP adoption will likely gain momentum, providing vendors with a valuable tool for enhancing security posture and stakeholder trust. Moreover, BBPs envelop vulnerability identification and disclosure into new market relationships and transactions, impacting software vendors' incentives regarding product security choices like release timing.</description>

      <title>Full Characterization of Adaptively Strong Majority Voting in Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowdsourcing, quality control is commonly achieved by having workers examine items and vote on their correctness. To minimize the impact of unreliable worker responses, a $\delta$-margin voting process is utilized, where additional votes are solicited until a predetermined threshold $\delta$ for agreement between workers is exceeded. The process is widely adopted but only as a heuristic. Our research presents a modeling approach using absorbing Markov chains to analyze the characteristics of this voting process that matter in crowdsourced processes. We provide closed-form equations for the quality of resulting consensus vote, the expected number of votes required for consensus, the variance of vote requirements, and other distribution moments. Our findings demonstrate how the threshold $\delta$ can be adjusted to achieve quality equivalence across voting processes that employ workers with varying accuracy levels. We also provide efficiency-equalizing payment rates for voting processes with different expected response accuracy levels. Additionally, our model considers items with varying degrees of difficulty and uncertainty about the difficulty of each example. Our simulations, using real-world crowdsourced vote data, validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model in characterizing the consensus aggregation process. The results of our study can be effectively employed in practical crowdsourcing applications.</description>

      <title>ZeroSwap: Data-driven Optimal Market Making in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are major centers of matching liquidity supply and demand in Decentralized Finance. Their functioning relies primarily on the presence of liquidity providers (LPs) incentivized to invest their assets into a liquidity pool. However, the prices at which a pooled asset is traded is often more stale than the prices on centralized and more liquid exchanges. This leads to the LPs suffering losses to arbitrage. This problem is addressed by adapting market prices to trader behavior, captured via the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. In this paper, we propose the first optimal Bayesian and the first model-free data-driven algorithm to optimally track the external price of the asset. The notion of optimality that we use enforces a zero-profit condition on the prices of the market maker, hence the name ZeroSwap. This ensures that the market maker balances losses to informed traders with profits from noise traders. The key property of our approach is the ability to estimate the external market price without the need for price oracles or loss oracles. Our theoretical guarantees on the performance of both these algorithms, ensuring the stability and convergence of their price recommendations, are of independent interest in the theory of reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate the robustness of our algorithms to changing market conditions.</description>

      <title>Designing Shared Information Displays for Agents of Varying Strategic Sophistication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven predictions are often perceived as inaccurate in hindsight due to behavioral responses. In this study, we explore the role of interface design choices in shaping individuals' decision-making processes in response to predictions presented on a shared information display in a strategic setting. We introduce a novel staged experimental design to investigate the effects of design features, such as visualizations of prediction uncertainty and error, within a repeated congestion game. In this game, participants assume the role of taxi drivers and use a shared information display to decide where to search for their next ride. Our experimental design endows agents with varying level-$k$ depths of thinking, allowing some agents to possess greater sophistication in anticipating the decisions of others using the same information display. Through several extensive experiments, we identify trade-offs between displays that optimize individual decisions and those that best serve the collective social welfare of the system. We find that the influence of display characteristics varies based on an agent's strategic sophistication. We observe that design choices promoting individual-level decision-making can lead to suboptimal system outcomes, as manifested by a lower realization of potential social welfare. However, this decline in social welfare is offset by a reduction in the distribution shift, narrowing the gap between predicted and realized system outcomes, which potentially enhances the perceived reliability and trustworthiness of the information display post hoc. Our findings pave the way for new research questions concerning the design of effective prediction interfaces in strategic environments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer in Content Moderation: The Human-AI Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successful content moderation in online platforms relies on a human-AI collaboration approach. A typical heuristic estimates the expected harmfulness of a post and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to remove it and whether to send it for human review. This disregards the prediction uncertainty, the time-varying element of human review capacity and post arrivals, and the selective sampling in the dataset (humans only review posts filtered by the admission algorithm).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture the human-AI interplay in content moderation. The algorithm observes contextual information for incoming posts, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules posts for human review. Only admitted posts receive human reviews on their harmfulness. These reviews help educate the machine-learning algorithms but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The classical learning-theoretic way to capture this human-AI interplay is via the framework of learning to defer, where the algorithm has the option to defer a classification task to humans for a fixed cost and immediately receive feedback. Our model contributes to this literature by introducing congestion in the human review system. Moreover, unlike work on online learning with delayed feedback where the delay in the feedback is exogenous to the algorithm's decisions, the delay in our model is endogenous to both the admission and the scheduling decisions.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems and hence our analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>
