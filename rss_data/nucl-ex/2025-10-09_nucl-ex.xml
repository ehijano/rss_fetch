      <title>Precise measurement of the $\gamma$-decay probability of the Hoyle state with a new triple coincidence-detection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the $\gamma$-decay probability of the Hoyle state with a new method of triple coincidence detection of a scattered $\alpha$ particle, a recoil $\rm ^{12}C$ nucleus, and a $\gamma$ ray in inelastic alpha scattering on $\rm ^{12}C$. This method successfully enabled a low-background measurement and a precise determination of the $\gamma$-decay probability of the Hoyle state as $\Gamma_\mathrm{\gamma}/\Gamma=[4.00 \pm 0.22 \mathrm{(sta.)} \pm 0.18 \mathrm{(sys.)}]\times10^{-4}$, which is consistent with the previous literature value. Therefore, we concluded that the literature value can be reliably used in the study of nucleosynthesis in the universe.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section at the CERN n\_TOF facility from subthermal energy to 120 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ reaction is of special interest in three different applications. First, in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy due to the presence of $^{35}Cl$ in brain and skin tissue. Second, it is involved in the creation of $^{36}S$, whose astrophysical origin remains unresolved. Third, in the designing of fast nuclear reactors of new generation based on molten salts. Purpose: To measure the $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section from thermal energy to 120 keV, determine the resonance parameters in this range and Maxwellian Averaged Cross-Section (MACS). Method: We made use of the Time-of-Flight technique with microMEGAS detectors at Experimental Area 2 (EAR-2) of n\_TOF facility at CERN. The $^{10}B(n, \alpha)^{7}Li$ and $^{235}U(n, f)$ reactions were used as references. Rutherford Back-scattering Spectrometry technique was performed at Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Sevilla, in order to accurately determine the masses of the irradiated samples. Results: We obtain a thermal cross-section of $0.470 \pm 0.009$ barns. The $1/v$ energy dependence of the cross-section is observed up to the first resonance at 0.398 keV, the resonances up to 120 keV are analyzed and MACS calculated for $k_{B} T$ from 1 to 100 keV. Conclusions: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section has been obtained over a wide energy range for the first time, with high accuracy across the aforementioned range. The thermal cross-section and first two resonances are in agreement with latest evaluation in ENDF/B-VIII.1, while lower resonance strength was found for high energy resonances. These data are used to calculate the MACS for different $k_{B} T$.</description>

      <title>SHADES -- $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction rate in the Gamow window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron capture reactions are the main contributors to the synthesis of the heavy elements through the s-process. Together with $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)16O, which has recently been measured by the LUNA collaboration in an energy region inside the Gamow peak, 22Ne({\alpha},n)25Mg is the other main neutron source in stars. Its cross section is mostly unknown in the relevant stellar energy (450 keV &lt; Ecm &lt; 750 keV), where only upper limits from direct experiments and highly uncertain estimates from indirect sources exist. The ERC project SHADES (UniNa/INFN) aims to provide for the first time direct cross section data in this region and to reduce the uncertainties of higher energy resonance parameters. High sensitivity measurements will be performed with the new LUNA-MV accelerator at the INFN-LNGS laboratory in Italy: the energy sensitivity of the SHADES hybrid neutron detector, together with the low background environment of the LNGS and the high beam current of the new accelerator promises to improve the sensitivity by over 2 orders of magnitude over the state of the art, allowing to finally probe the unexplored low-energy cross section. Here we present an overview of the project and first results on the setup characterization.</description>

      <title>Detectors and Shieldings: Past and Future at LUNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions are responsible for the chemical evolution of stars, galaxies and the Universe. Unfortunately, at temperatures of interest for nuclear astrophysics, the cross-sections of the thermonuclear reactions are in the pico-femto-barn range and thus measuring them in the laboratory is extremely challenging. In this framework, major steps forward were made with the advent of underground nuclear astrophysics, pioneered by the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). The cosmic background reduction by several orders of magnitude obtained at LUNA, however, needs to be combined with high-performance detectors and dedicated shieldings to obtain the required sensitivity. In the present paper, we report on the recent and future detector-shielding designs at LUNA.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Flow Networks</title>

Abstract: Jet substructure provides one of the most exciting new approaches for searching for physics in and beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Modern jet substructure searches are often performed with Neural Network (NN) taggers which study the jets' radiation distributions in great detail, far beyond what is theoretically described by parton shower generators. While this represents a great opportunity, as NNs look deeper into the structure of jets they become increasingly sensitive both to perturbative and non-perturbative theoretical uncertainties. It is therefore important to be able to control which aspects of both regimes the networks focus on, and to develop techniques for quantifying these uncertainties. In this paper we take two steps in this direction: First, we introduce EnFNs, a generalization of the Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) which directly probes higher point correlations in jets, as motivated by recent advances in the study of energy correlators. Second, we introduce a number of techniques to quantify and visualize their robustness to non-perturbative corrections. We highlight the importance of such considerations in a toy study incorporating systematics into a search, and maximizing for the network's discovery significance, as opposed to absolute tagging performance. We hope this study continues the interest in understanding the role QCD systematics play in Machine Learning applications and opens the door to a better interplay between theory and experiment in HEP.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of a new channel of the DD reaction at very-low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of a new, strong reaction channel of the deuteron-deuteron fusion at very low energies might have major consequences for the construction of a future clean and efficient energy source. Following the first theoretical and experimental indications for the existence of the deuteron-deuteron threshold resonance in the $^4$He nucleus and its dominant decay by the internal $e^+e^-$ pair creation, we present here an extensive experimental study confirming emission of high-energy electrons and positrons. A simultaneous use of Si charged particle detectors of different thicknesses and large volume NaI(Tl) and HPGe detectors has allowed for the first time to determine the branching ratio between emitted protons, neutrons and $e^+e^-$ pairs for deuteron energies down to 5 keV. The high-energy positrons could be unambiguously detected by their bremsstrahlung spectra and annihilation radiation, supported by the Monte Carlo Geant4 simulations. The theoretical calculations, based on a destructive interference between the threshold resonance and the known broad resonance in $^4$He, agree very well with experimentally observed increase of branching ratios for lowering projectile energies. The partial width of the threshold resonance for the $e^+e^-$ pair creation should be at least 10 times larger than that of the proton channel.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the radii of oxygen isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an {\em ab initio} study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from $^{16}$O to $^{20}$O using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N$^3$LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the {\em partial pinhole algorithm}, significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for $^{16}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{18}$O closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of $2.810(32)$ fm for $^{20}$O. The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Realistic shell model for ordinary muon capture of sd-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report about a study of the ordinary muon capture in nuclei belonging to the sd shell, an electroweak process that occurs with exchange momenta far larger than ordinary beta decays (approximately 100 MeV). Such a characteristic places this transition in an energy range that is consistent with the neutrinoless double-beta decay, and represents an interesting test for nuclear models to support their predictions of the nuclear matrix elements for such an unobserved process. For the first time, the calculations are carried out within the realistic shell model (RSM), namely employing effective shell-model Hamiltonians and decay operators derived from realistic nuclear forces, without resorting to any empirical adjustment of the coupling constants. This is a chapter of a research program that is aimed to assess the realistic shell model in reproducing the observables related to electroweak processes in nuclei, and then to evaluate the reliability of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay that are calculated within this approach. We calculate the partial capture rates for many nuclear systems in the sd-shell region, as well as their spectroscopic properties, and compare the results with the available experimental counterparts. Such a comparison tests the relevance of a microscopic approach to the renormalization of transition operators to reproduce data and provide solid predictions of unknown observables.</description>
