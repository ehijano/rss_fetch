      <title>Mechanically Regulated Cranial Growth in Infancy: A Computational Approach to Predicting Craniosynostosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In early years of life, the cranium rapidly changes in size and shape to accommodate brain growth, primarily driven by mechanical stress from brain expansion. Developmental disorders such as premature fusion of sutures in craniosynostosis, disrupts normal growth process, leading to abnormal skull shapes. Thus, understanding the interplay between biomechanical forces, soft tissues, and individual bone plates is crucial for understanding their role in shaping infant skulls. This study develops a mechanically-driven growth model to simulate healthy cranial growth in the first year. The algorithm considers simultaneous and coupled growth of brain, cranial bones, sutures, with volumetric brain expansion as the primary driver, with strain-based feedback governing growth in bone and suture tissues. A bulk bone formation approach accounts for evolving mechanical properties, with elastic moduli of bone and sutures increasing monthly. The model was applied on individual fused sutures and skull dysmorphologies due to craniosynostosis were predicted, and results showed good agreement with clinically observations. Stress at bone-suture interfaces and elevated intracranial pressure under fused sutures highlighted biomechanical impacts due to the disorders. Sensitivity analysis explored how material properties and growth rates affect skull shape. This framework enhances understanding of cranial growth and supports treatment planning for craniosynostosis.</description>

      <title>Self-organized epithelial reticulum inhibits cell proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).</description>
