      <title>Building robust surrogate models of laser-plasma interactions using large scale PIC simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the repetition rates of ultra-high intensity lasers increase, simulations used for the prediction of experimental results may need to be augmented with machine learning to keep up. In this paper, the usage of gaussian process regression in producing surrogate models of laser-plasma interactions from particle-in-cell simulations is investigated. Such a model retains the characteristic behaviour of the simulations but allows for faster on-demand results and estimation of statistical noise. A demonstrative model of Bremsstrahlung emission by hot electrons from a femtosecond timescale laser pulse in the $10^{20} - 10^{23}\;\mathrm{Wcm}^{-2}$ intensity range is produced using 800 simulations of such a laser-solid interaction from 1D hybrid-PIC. While the simulations required 84,000 CPU-hours to generate, subsequent training occurs on the order of a minute on a single core and prediction takes only a fraction of a second. The model trained on this data is then compared against analytical expectations. The efficiency of training the model and its subsequent ability to distinguish types of noise within the data are analysed, and as a result error bounds on the model are defined.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ornstein-Zernike Theory for Two-Temperature Two-Component Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the new idea of a nonlinear active plasma lens, as part of a larger transport lattice for achromatic electron beam transport. The proposed implementation is based on using the Hall effect in a plasma and is motivated by 1D-hydrodynamic simulations. The manufactured design is presented, including its undergoing experimental characterisation on the CLEAR beam-line at CERN.</description>

      <title>Induced Compton scattering in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.</description>

      <title>Generation of fast magnetoacoustic waves in the corona by impulsive bursty reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. We here simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of $\mathrm{10^{5}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the current sheet. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a $"$Symbiosis of WAves and Reconnection (SWAR)$"$.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid waves during asymmetric reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data to investigate electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid drift waves during magnetopause reconnection. We analyze waves observed in an electron-scale plasma mixing layer at the edge of the magnetospheric outflow. Using high-resolution 7.5 ms electron moments, we obtain an electron current density with a Nyquist frequency of ~66 Hz, sufficient to resolve most of the lower hybrid drift wave power observed in the event. We then employ wavelet analysis to evaluate dJ.dE, which accounts for the phase differences between the fluctuating quantities. The analysis shows that the energy exchange is localized within the plasma mixing layer, and it is highly fluctuating, with energy bouncing between waves and electrons throughout the analyzed time and frequency range. However, the cumulative sum over time indicates a net energy transfer from the waves to electrons. We observe an anomalous electron flow toward the magnetosphere, consistent with diffusion and electron mixing. These results indicate that waves and electrons interact dynamically to dissipate the excess internal energy accumulated by sharp density gradients. We conclude that the electron temperature profile within the plasma mixing layer is produced by a combination of electron diffusion across the layer, as well as heating by large-scale parallel potential and lower hybrid drift waves.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that show outstanding agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce muon beams with GeV energies and fluxes, at a few meters from the source, up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than cosmic ray muons. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high fluxes which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonaxisymmetric standard magnetorotational instability induced by a free-shear layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) is widely believed to be responsible for the observed accretion rates in astronomical disks. It is a linear instability triggered in the differentially rotating ionized disk flow by a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis. Most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI in conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile for accretion disks or an ideal Couette profile for Taylor-Couette flows, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number Rm more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI can be destabilized in a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm $\gtrsim$ 1, the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally (Nat. Commun. 13, 4679 (2022)) is the nonaxisymmetric SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications since free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factors of Warm Dense Matter from Time-Dependent Orbital-Free and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first calculations of the inelastic part of the dynamical structure factor (DSF) for warm dense matter (WDM) using Time-Dependent Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (TD-OF-DFT) and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic (mixed) Kohn Sham TD-DFT (KS TD-DFT). WDM is an intermediate phase of matter found in planetary cores and laser-driven experiments, where the accurate calculation of the DSF is critical for interpreting X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements. Traditional TD-DFT methods, while highly accurate, are computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of TD-OF-DFT and mixed TD-KS-DFT as more efficient alternatives. We applied these methods to experimentally measured WDM systems, including solid-density aluminum and beryllium, compressed beryllium, and carbon-hydrogen mixtures. Our results show that TD-OF-DFT requires a dynamical kinetic energy potential in order to qualitatively capture the plasmon response. Additionally, it struggles with capturing bound electron contributions and accurately modeling plasmon dynamics without the inclusion of a dynamic kinetic energy potential. In contrast, mixed TD-KS-DFT offers greater accuracy in distinguishing bound and free electron effects, aligning well with experimental data, though at a higher computational cost. This study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that TD-OF-DFT remains a valuable tool for rapid scans of parameter space, while mixed TD-KS-DFT should be preferred for high-fidelity simulations. Our findings provide insight into the future development of DFT methods for WDM and suggest potential improvements for TD-OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Proton Acceleration in Low-beta Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by non-thermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDE), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-beta magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from non-thermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are widely observed in various astronomical contexts, yet much remains unknown about their significance across different systems and cosmic epochs. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. To address this gap, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ percent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ percent across the 3 kpc extention, indicating the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. The polarised dust emission is patchy, offset from the total dust emission and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>
