      <title>Implicit Numerical Scheme for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Quasi-Variational Inequality in the Optimal Market-Making Problem with Alpha Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of combined stochastic and impulse control for a market maker operating in a limit order book. The problem is formulated as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJBQVI). We propose an implicit time-discretization scheme coupled with a policy iteration algorithm. This approach removes time-step restrictions typical of explicit methods and ensures unconditional stability. Convergence to the unique viscosity solution is established by verifying monotonicity, stability, and consistency conditions and applying the comparison principle.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time asset price bubbles with short sales prohibitions under model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate asset price bubbles in a discrete-time, discrete-state market under model uncertainty and short sales prohibitions. Building on a new fundamental theorem of asset pricing and a superhedging duality in this setting, we introduce a notion of bubble based on a novel definition of the fundamental price, and analyze their types and characterization. We show that two distinct types of bubbles arise, depending on the maturity structure of the asset. For assets with bounded maturity and no dividend payments, the $G$-supermartingale property of prices provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of bubbles. In contrast, when maturity is unbounded, the infi-supermartingale property yields a necessary condition, while the $G$-supermartingale property remains sufficient. Moreover, there is no bubble under a strengthened no dominance condition. As applications, we examine price bubbles for several standard contingent claims. We show that put-call parity generally fails for fundamental prices, whereas it holds for market prices under no dominance assumption. Furthermore, we establish bounds for the fundamental and market prices of American call options in terms of the corresponding European call prices, adjusted by the associated bubble components.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium investment under dynamic preference uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time portfolio choice problem for an investor whose state-dependent preferences are determined by an exogenous factor that evolves as an It\^o diffusion process. Since risk attitudes at the end of the investment horizon are uncertain, terminal wealth is evaluated under a set of utility functions corresponding to all possible future preference states. These utilities are first converted into certainty equivalents at their respective levels of terminal risk aversion and then (nonlinearly) aggregated over the conditional distribution of future states, yielding an inherently time-inconsistent optimization criterion. We approach this problem by developing a general equilibrium framework for such state-dependent preferences and characterizing subgame-perfect equilibrium investment policies through an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. This system gives rise to a coupled nonlinear partial integro-differential equation for the value functions associated with each state. We then specialize the model to a tractable constant relative risk aversion specification in which the preference factor follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. In this setting, the equilibrium policy admits a semi-explicit representation that decomposes into a standard myopic demand and a novel preference-hedging component that captures incentives to hedge against anticipated changes in risk aversion. Numerical experiments illustrate how features of the preference dynamics -- most notably the drift of the preference process and the correlation between preference shocks and asset returns -- jointly determine the sign and magnitude of the hedging demand and the evolution of the equilibrium risky investment over time.</description>

      <title>Asset pricing under model uncertainty with discrete time and states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the asset pricing under model uncertainty with discrete time and states structure. For the single-period securities model, we give a novel definition of arbitrage under a family of probability, and explore of its relationship with risk neutral probability measure. Focusing on the financial market with short sales prohibitions, we separately investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for no-arbitrage asset pricing based on nonlinear expectation which composed with a family of probability. When each linear expectation driven by the probability in the family of probability becomes a martingale measure, the necessary and sufficient conditions are same, which coincide with the existing results. Furthermore, we expand the main results of single-period securities model to the case of multi-period securities model. By-product, we obtain the superhedging prices of contingent claim under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Liquidity and Risk Offsetting in Decentralised Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an economic model of decentralised exchanges (DEXs) in which risk-averse liquidity providers (LPs) manage risk in a centralised exchange (CEX) based on preferences, information, and trading costs. Rational, risk-averse LPs anticipate the frictions associated with replication and manage risk primarily by reducing the reserves supplied to the DEX. Greater aversion reduces the equilibrium viability of liquidity provision, resulting in thinner markets and lower trading volumes. Greater uninformed demand supports deeper liquidity, whereas higher fundamental price volatility erodes it. Finally, while moderate anticipated price changes can improve LP performance, larger changes require more intensive trading in the CEX, generate higher replication costs, and induce LPs to reduce liquidity supply.</description>
