      <title>Remarks on Lipschitz geometry on globally conic singular manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metric properties of manifolds with conic singularities and present a natural interplay between metrically conic and metrically asymptotically conic behaviour. As a consequence, we prove that a singular sub-manifold is Lipschitz normally embedded, i.e. its inner and outer metric structures are equivalent, in an ambient singular manifold, wheneverthe singularities are conic and the ends of the manifold are asymptotically conic, which answers positively a question raised in our last work.</description>

      <title>Some observations on Erd\H{o}s matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that every $n\times n$ bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\|A\|_{F}^2\leq \max_{\sigma\in S_n}A_{i,\sigma(i)}$ where $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices for which the equality holds in the Marcus-Ree inequality. We refer to such matrices as Erd\H{o}s matrices. While this problem is trivial in dimension $n=2$, the case of dimension $n=3$ was resolved in~\cite{bouthat2024question} in 2023. We prove that for every $n$, there are only finitely many $n\times n$ Erd\H{o}s matrices. We also give a characterization of Erd\H{o}s matrices that yields an algorithm to generate all Erd\H{o}s matrices in any given dimension. We also prove that Erd\H{o}s matrices can have only rational entries. This answers a question of~\cite{bouthat2024question}.</description>

      <title>Stability of reverse isoperimetric inequalities in the plane: area, Cheeger, and inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present sharp stability results for various reverse isoperimetric problems in $\mathbb R^2$. Specifically, we prove the stability of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for $\lambda$-convex bodies -- convex bodies with the property that each of their boundary points $p$ supports a ball of radius $1/\lambda$ so that the body lies inside the ball in a neighborhood of $p$. For convex bodies with smooth boundaries, $\lambda$-convexity is equivalent to having the curvature of the boundary bounded below by $\lambda &gt; 0$. Additionally, within this class of convex bodies, we establish stability for the reverse inradius inequality and the reverse Cheeger inequality. Even without its stability version, the sharp reverse Cheeger inequality is new in dimension $2$.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic finiteness properties of locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare finiteness properties of locally compact groups that generalize the properties of being compactly generated and of being compactly presented. Three such families of properties have been proposed: Abels--Tiemeyer's type $C_n$, coarse $(n-1)$-connectedness, and Castellano--Corob-Cook's type $F_n$. The first was defined for locally compact groups, the second can be defined for general topological groups, while the third was defined only for tdlc groups. We prove that all three families lead to the same notion for locally compact groups. This justifies working with these properties despite the fact that it is still unclear in which sense they describe finiteness properties of free classifying spaces for locally compact groups. Various parts of the arguments are well-known to various experts. By putting them together we hope to clarify the literature.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasisymmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar, combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called iterated graph systems (IGS), which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counterexamples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

Abstract: Here we propose a class of frameworks in the plane, braced polygons, that may be globally rigid and are analogous to convex polyopes in 3 space that are rigid by Cauchy's rigidity Theorem in 1813.</description>

      <title>Bounding Shortest Closed Geodesics with Diameter on compact 2-dimensional Orbifolds Homeomorphic to $S^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Length bounded sweepouts give a way to bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a closed manifold. In this paper, we generalized to the case of compact 2-dimensional orbifolds homeomorphic to $S^2$ as well as compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with finite orbifold fundamental groups. We proved an inequality for the length of the shortest closed orbifold geodesic in terms of the diameter.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on a Riemannian manifold endowed with an exact magnetic field, replacing geodesics by minimizers of an action functional given by the length minus the integral of the magnetic potential. We prove that nonnegativity of a suitably defined magnetic Ricci curvature is equivalent to a magnetic Brunn-Minkowski inequality. More generally, given an arbitrary volume form on the manifold, we introduce a weighted magnetic Ricci curvature, and prove a magnetic version of the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>A generalized Legendre duality relation and Gaussian saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the barycenter problem in optimal transportation theory, Kolesnikov--Werner recently extended the notion of the Legendre duality relation for two functions to the case for multiple functions. We further generalize the duality relation and then establish the centered Gaussian saturation property for a Blaschke--Santal\'{o} type inequality associated with it. Our approach to the understanding such a generalized Legendre duality relation is based on our earlier observation that directly links Legendre duality with the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. More precisely, for a large family of degenerate Brascamp--Lieb data, we prove that the centered Gaussian saturation property for the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality holds true when inputs are restricted to even and log-concave functions.
  As an application to convex geometry, we establish the most important case of a conjecture of Kolesnikov and Werner about the Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality for multiple even functions as well as multiple symmetric convex bodies. Furthermore, in the direction of information theory and optimal transportation theory, this provides an affirmative answer to another conjecture of Kolesnikov--Werner about a Talagrand type inequality for multiple even probability measures that involves the Wasserstein barycenter.</description>
