      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for Internet of Vehicles AFDM Communications With Sparse Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has been considered as a promising waveform to enable high-reliable connectivity in the internet of vehicles. However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Stochastic Analysis of Random Linear Streaming Codes in Multi-Hop Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the stochastic performance limit of large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) in multi-hop relay networks. In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be "detained" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept "information debt" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a "band fashion" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.</description>

      <title>Rotatable IRS-Assisted 6DMA Communications: A Two-timescale Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) are promising technologies to enhance wireless communication by reconfiguring channels at the environment and transceiver sides. However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol.</description>

      <title>Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Energy Profile Dependent Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sparse principal component analysis in the high-dimensional, sample-limited regime, aiming to recover a leading component supported on a few coordinates. Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \(s(p)\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \(p\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \(\max_{1\le p\le k} p\,s^2(p)\,\log n\), which matches the classical \(k^2\log n\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \(k\log n\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Symbol Detection in Ambient Backscatter Communications Under Residual Time Synchronization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC), where a backscatter transmitter (BT) modulates and reflects ambient signals to a backscatter receiver (BR), have been deemed a low-power communication technology for the Internet of Things. Previous work on symbol detection in AmBC assumed perfect time synchronization (TS), which is unrealistic in practice. The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples. The analytical results are verified by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation For Fluid Antenna System Exploiting Geographical and Angular Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) refers to a family of reconfigurable antenna technologies that provide substantial spatial gains within a compact, predefined small space, thereby offering extensive degrees of freedom in the physical layer for future communication networks. The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design. Extensive numerical results validate the promising efficacy of the proposed algorithm designs and the derived analytical findings.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Radio Localization: A Channel Charting-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting creates a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment in a self-supervised manner using manifold learning. Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.</description>

      <title>Variational Robust Kalman Filters: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness and adaptivity are two competing objectives in Kalman filters (KF). Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Anti-Interference AFDM System: Interference Impacts Analyses and Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an anti-interference affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) system to ensure reliability and resource efficiency under malicious high-power interference originating from adversarial devices in high-mobility scenarios. Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reducing Pilots in Channel Estimation With Predictive Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is essential for modern wireless systems, which becomes increasingly difficult under large antenna arrays, strict pilot overhead constraints, and diverse deployment environments. Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Phase Retrieval: Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the sample complexity and develop efficient optimal algorithms for 1-bit phase retrieval: recovering a signal $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ phaseless bits $\{\mathrm{sign}(|\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{x}|-\tau)\}_{i=1}^m$ generated by standard Gaussian $\mathbf{a}_i$s. By investigating a phaseless version of random hyperplane tessellation, we show that (constrained) hamming distance minimization uniformly recovers all unstructured signals with Euclidean norm bounded away from zero and infinity to the error $\mathcal{O}((n/m)\log(m/n))$, and $\mathcal{O}((k/m)\log(mn/k^2))$ when restricting to $k$-sparse signals. Both error rates are shown to be information-theoretically optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. Intriguingly, the optimal rate for sparse recovery matches that of 1-bit compressed sensing, suggesting that the phase information is non-essential for 1-bit compressed sensing. We also develop efficient algorithms for 1-bit (sparse) phase retrieval that can achieve these error rates. Specifically, we prove that (thresholded) gradient descent with respect to the one-sided $\ell_1$-loss, when initialized via spectral methods, converges linearly and attains the near optimal reconstruction error, with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for unstructured signals and $\mathcal{O}(k^2\log(n)\log^2(m/k))$ for $k$-sparse signals. Our proof is based upon the observation that a certain local (restricted) approximate invertibility condition is respected by Gaussian measurements. Our results establish the major findings of (memoryless) 1-bit compressed sensing in a phaseless setting.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have substantially improved communication performance, but their high computational cost hinders practical deployment. Moreover, certain applications require the ability to dynamically adapt computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a Feature Importance-Aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC) model for image transmission that is both computationally efficient and adjustable. FAJSCC employs axis-dimension specialized computation, which performs efficient operations individually for each spatial and channel axis, significantly reducing computational cost while representing features effectively. It further incorporates selective deformable self-attention, which applies self-attention only to selected and adaptively adjusted features, leveraging the importance and relations of input features to efficiently capture complex feature correlations. Another key feature of FAJSCC is that the number of selected important areas can be controlled separately by the encoder and the decoder, depending on the available computational budget. It makes FAJSCC the first deepJSCC architecture to allow independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. Experimental results show that FAJSCC achieves superior image transmission performance under various channel conditions while requiring less computational complexity than recent state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, experiments independently varying the encoder and decoder's computational resources reveal, for the first time in the deepJSCC literature, that understanding the meaning of noisy features in the decoder demands the greatest computational cost. The code is publicly available at github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCCv2.</description>

      <title>Curved representational Bregman divergences and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy to the terminology of curved exponential families in statistics, we define curved Bregman divergences as Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter subspaces and sub-dimensional Bregman divergences when the restrictions are linear. A common example of curved Bregman divergence is the cosine dissimilarity between normalized vectors. We show that the barycenter of a finite weighted set of parameters under a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the right Bregman projection onto the nonlinear subspace of the barycenter with respect to the full Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences, (2) pointwise symmetrized Bregman divergences, and (3) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We explain how to reparameterize sub-dimensional Bregman divergences on simplicial sub-dimensional domains. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Shannon Index: A Geometric-Aware Measure of Clustering Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI) for clustered continuous data is introduced as a normalized measure that captures the relationship between geometry-based and frequency-based probability distributions defined over the clusters. In essence, it quantifies the similarity across densities of the clusters, which are defined by a given labeling. This labeling may originate from a geometric partitioning of the state space itself, but need not in general. We illustrate its performance on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark data set, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the BSI provides a coherent assessment in cases where traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in the resource-allocation setting where equal density may be associated with a "fair" distribution, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects inequality with high sensitivity, but also offers a numerically smooth measure that can be easily embedded in optimization frameworks as a regularization term for modern policy-making. Finally, the BSI also offers a new measure of the effectiveness for a given symbolic representation, i.e. coarse-grain states, for continuous-valued data recorded from complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Algebra in Algorithmic Coding Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the notion and history of error-correcting codes and the algorithms needed to make them effective in information transmission. We then give some basic as well as more modern constructions of, and algorithms for, error-correcting codes that depend on relatively simple elements of applied algebra. While the role of algebra in the constructions of codes has been widely acknowledged in texts and other writings, the role in the design of algorithms is often less widely understood, and this survey hopes to reduce this difference to some extent.</description>

      <title>Algorithmizing the Multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma asserts that over a field, a low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a sufficiently large product set. Since its discovery in a work of Dvir, Kopparty, Saraf and Sudan [SIAM J. Comput., 2013], the lemma has found numerous applications in both math and computer science; in particular, in the definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014].
  In this work, we show how to algorithmize the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma for arbitrary product sets over any field. In other words, we give an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of multivariate multiplicity codes from half their minimum distance on arbitrary product sets over all fields. Previously, such an algorithm was known either when the underlying product set had a nice algebraic structure: for instance, was a subfield (by Kopparty [ToC, 2015]) or when the underlying field had large (or zero) characteristic, the multiplicity parameter was sufficiently large and the multiplicity code had distance bounded away from $1$ (Bhandari, Harsha, Kumar and Sudan [STOC 2021]). In particular, even unique decoding of bivariate multiplicity codes with multiplicity two from half their minimum distance was not known over arbitrary product sets over any field.
  Our algorithm builds upon a result of Kim and Kopparty [ToC, 2017] who gave an algorithmic version of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (without multiplicities) or equivalently, an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of Reed-Muller codes over arbitrary product sets. We introduce a refined notion of distance based on the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma and design a unique decoding algorithm for this distance measure. On the way, we give an alternate analysis of Forney's classical generalized minimum distance decoder that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of discrete entropy for log-concave random vectors on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the following type of discrete entropy monotonicity for sums of isotropic, log-concave, independent and identically distributed random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$: $$ H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n+1}) \geq H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n}) + \frac{d}{2}\log{\Bigl(\frac{n+1}{n}\Bigr)} +o(1), $$ where $o(1)$ vanishes as $H(X_1) \to \infty$. Moreover, for the $o(1)$-term, we obtain a rate of convergence $ O\Bigl({H(X_1)}{e^{-\frac{1}{d}H(X_1)}}\Bigr)$, where the implied constants depend on $d$ and $n$. This generalizes to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ the one-dimensional result of the second named author (2023). As in dimension one, our strategy is to establish that the discrete entropy $H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n})$ is close to the differential (continuous) entropy $h(X_1+U_1+\cdots+X_{n}+U_{n})$, where $U_1,\dots, U_n$ are independent and identically distributed uniform random vectors on $[0,1]^d$ and to apply the theorem of Artstein, Ball, Barthe and Naor (2004) on the monotonicity of differential entropy. In fact, we show this result under more general assumptions than log-concavity, which are preserved up to constants under convolution. In order to show that log-concave distributions satisfy our assumptions in dimension $d\ge2$, more involved tools from convex geometry are needed because a suitable position is required. We show that, for a log-concave function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in isotropic position, its integral, barycenter and covariance matrix are close to their discrete counterparts. Moreover, in the log-concave case, we weaken the isotropicity assumption to what we call almost isotropicity. One of our technical tools is a discrete analogue to the upper bound on the isotropic constant of a log-concave function, which extends to dimensions $d\ge1$ a result of Bobkov, Marsiglietti and Melbourne (2022).</description>

      <title>Visible Light Indoor Positioning with a Single LED and Distributed Single-Element OIRS: An Iterative Approach with Adaptive Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first, the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position. Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</description>

      <title>Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</description>
