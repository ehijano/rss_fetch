      <title>InspireMusic: Integrating Super Resolution and Large Language Model for High-Fidelity Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InspireMusic, a framework integrated super resolution and large language model for high-fidelity long-form music generation. A unified framework generates high-fidelity music, songs, and audio, which incorporates an autoregressive transformer with a super-resolution flow-matching model. This framework enables the controllable generation of high-fidelity long-form music at a higher sampling rate from both text and audio prompts. Our model differs from previous approaches, as we utilize an audio tokenizer with one codebook that contains richer semantic information, thereby reducing training costs and enhancing efficiency. This combination enables us to achieve high-quality audio generation with long-form coherence of up to $8$ minutes. Then, an autoregressive transformer model based on Qwen 2.5 predicts audio tokens. Next, we employ a super-resolution flow-matching model to generate high-sampling rate audio with fine-grained details learned from an acoustic codec model. Comprehensive experiments show that the InspireMusic-1.5B-Long model has a comparable performance to recent top-tier open-source systems, including MusicGen and Stable Audio 2.0, on subjective and objective evaluations. The code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/InspireMusic.</description>

      <title>Synthetic data enables context-aware bioacoustic sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for training foundation models that enhances their in-context learning capabilities within the domain of bioacoustic signal processing. We use synthetically generated training data, introducing a domain-randomization-based pipeline that constructs diverse acoustic scenes with temporally strong labels. We generate over 8.8 thousand hours of strongly-labeled audio and train a query-by-example, transformer-based model to perform few-shot bioacoustic sound event detection. Our second contribution is a public benchmark of 13 diverse few-shot bioacoustics tasks. Our model outperforms previously published methods by 49%, and we demonstrate that this is due to both model design and data scale. We make our trained model available via an API, to provide ecologists and ethologists with a training-free tool for bioacoustic sound event detection.</description>

      <title>Language Model Mapping in Multimodal Music Learning: A Grand Challenge Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have seen remarkable success in representation learning and language models (LMs) using deep neural networks. Many studies aim to build the underlying connections among different modalities via the alignment and mappings at the token or embedding level, but so far, most methods are very data-hungry, limiting their performance in domains such as music where paired data are less abundant. We argue that the embedding alignment is only at the surface level of multimodal alignment. In this paper, we propose a grand challenge of \textit{language model mapping} (LMM), i.e., how to map the essence implied in the LM of one domain to the LM of another domain under the assumption that LMs of different modalities are tracking the same underlying phenomena. We first introduce a basic setup of LMM, highlighting the goal to unveil a deeper aspect of cross-modal alignment as well as to achieve more sample-efficiency learning. We then discuss why music is an ideal domain in which to conduct LMM research. After that, we connect LMM in music with a more general and challenging scientific problem of \textit{learning to take actions based on both sensory input and abstract symbols}, and in the end, present an advanced version of the challenge problem setup.</description>

      <title>PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

      <title>Acoustic Anomaly Detection on UAM Propeller Defect with Acoustic dataset for Crack of drone Propeller (ADCP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imminent commercialization of UAM requires stable, AI-based maintenance systems to ensure safety for both passengers and pedestrians. This paper presents a methodology for non-destructively detecting cracks in UAM propellers using drone propeller sound datasets. Normal operating sounds were recorded, and abnormal sounds (categorized as ripped and broken) were differentiated by varying the microphone-propeller angle and throttle power. Our novel approach integrates FFT and STFT preprocessing techniques to capture both global frequency patterns and local time-frequency variations, thereby enhancing anomaly detection performance. The constructed Acoustic Dataset for Crack of Drone Propeller (ADCP) demonstrates the potential for detecting propeller cracks and lays the groundwork for future UAM maintenance applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Speech Translation Systems through Targeted Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As speech translation (ST) systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable communication. However, limited work has explored this issue in depth. This paper explores methods of compromising these systems through imperceptible audio manipulations. Specifically, we present two innovative approaches: (1) the injection of perturbation into source audio, and (2) the generation of adversarial music designed to guide targeted translation, while also conducting more practical over-the-air attacks in the physical world. Our experiments reveal that carefully crafted audio perturbations can mislead translation models to produce targeted, harmful outputs, while adversarial music achieve this goal more covertly, exploiting the natural imperceptibility of music. These attacks prove effective across multiple languages and translation models, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in current ST architectures. The implications of this research extend beyond immediate security concerns, shedding light on the interpretability and robustness of neural speech processing systems. Our findings underscore the need for advanced defense mechanisms and more resilient architectures in the realm of audio systems.

      <title>Voice Cloning for Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Addressing Data Scarcity in Speech-Language Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores voice cloning to generate synthetic speech replicating the unique patterns of individuals with dysarthria. Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria.
  We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.</description>

      <title>Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>FlowDec: A flow-based full-band general audio codec with high perceptual quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose FlowDec, a neural full-band audio codec for general audio sampled at 48 kHz that combines non-adversarial codec training with a stochastic postfilter based on a novel conditional flow matching method. Compared to the prior work ScoreDec which is based on score matching, we generalize from speech to general audio and move from 24 kbit/s to as low as 4 kbit/s, while improving output quality and reducing the required postfilter DNN evaluations from 60 to 6 without any fine-tuning or distillation techniques. We provide theoretical insights and geometric intuitions for our approach in comparison to ScoreDec as well as another recent work that uses flow matching, and conduct ablation studies on our proposed components. We show that FlowDec is a competitive alternative to the recent GAN-dominated stream of neural codecs, achieving FAD scores better than those of the established GAN-based codec DAC and listening test scores that are on par, and producing qualitatively more natural reconstructions for speech and harmonic structures in music.</description>

      <title>Spark-TTS: An Efficient LLM-Based Text-to-Speech Model with Single-Stream Decoupled Speech Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, existing foundation models rely on multi-stage processing or complex architectures for predicting multiple codebooks, limiting efficiency and integration flexibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spark-TTS, a novel system powered by BiCodec, a single-stream speech codec that decomposes speech into two complementary token types: low-bitrate semantic tokens for linguistic content and fixed-length global tokens for speaker attributes. This disentangled representation, combined with the Qwen2.5 LLM and a chain-of-thought (CoT) generation approach, enables both coarse-grained control (e.g., gender, speaking style) and fine-grained adjustments (e.g., precise pitch values, speaking rate). To facilitate research in controllable TTS, we introduce VoxBox, a meticulously curated 100,000-hour dataset with comprehensive attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spark-TTS not only achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning but also generates highly customizable voices that surpass the limitations of reference-based synthesis. Source code, pre-trained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS.</description>

      <title>BGM2Pose: Active 3D Human Pose Estimation with Non-Stationary Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose BGM2Pose, a non-invasive 3D human pose estimation method using arbitrary music (e.g., background music) as active sensing signals. Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>UniWav: Towards Unified Pre-training for Speech Representation Learning and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training and representation learning have been playing an increasingly important role in modern speech processing. Nevertheless, different applications have been relying on different foundation models, since predominant pre-training techniques are either designed for discriminative tasks or generative tasks. In this work, we make the first attempt at building a unified pre-training framework for both types of tasks in speech. We show that with the appropriate design choices for pre-training, one can jointly learn a representation encoder and generative audio decoder that can be applied to both types of tasks. We propose UniWav, an encoder-decoder framework designed to unify pre-training representation learning and generative tasks. On speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech tokenization, UniWav achieves comparable performance to different existing foundation models, each trained on a specific task. Our findings suggest that a single general-purpose foundation model for speech can be built to replace different foundation models, reducing the overhead and cost of pre-training.</description>

Despite their improved performance in controlled settings, there remains a critical gap in understanding their efficacy and equity in real-world scenarios. We analyze ASR biases w.r.t. gender, accent, and age group, as well as their effect on downstream tasks. In addition, we examine the environmental impact of ASR systems, scrutinizing the use of large acoustic models on carbon emission and energy consumption. We also provide insights into our empirical analyses, offering a valuable contribution to the claims surrounding bias and sustainability in ASR systems.</description>

      <title>Talking Turns: Benchmarking Audio Foundation Models on Turn-Taking Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent wave of audio foundation models (FMs) could provide new capabilities for conversational modeling. However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems.</description>

      <title>Developing a Multilingual Dataset and Evaluation Metrics for Code-Switching: A Focus on Hong Kong's Polylingual Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existing audio datasets are predominantly tailored towards single languages, overlooking the complex linguistic behaviors of multilingual communities that engage in code-switching. This practice, where individuals frequently mix two or more languages in their daily interactions, is particularly prevalent in multilingual regions such as Hong Kong, China. To bridge this gap, we have developed a 34.8-hour dataset of Mixed Cantonese and English (MCE) audio using our Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework (MADGF). We fine-tuned the open-source multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, with the MCE dataset, leading to impressive zero-shot performance. The traditional metrics overlook important factors such as latency in real-world applications and code-switching scenarios. We have introduced a novel evaluation metric called Fidelity to the Original Audio, Accuracy, and Latency (FAL). This metric aims to overcome the limitations of traditional metrics used to assess ASR systems.</description>

      <title>An Effective Automated Speaking Assessment Approach to Mitigating Data Scarcity and Imbalanced Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) typically involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hand-crafted feature extraction from the ASR transcript of a learner's speech. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss reweighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10% in CEFR prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning from Synthetic Audio Doppelg\"angers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning robust audio representations currently demands extensive datasets of real-world sound recordings. By applying artificial transformations to these recordings, models can learn to recognize similarities despite subtle variations through techniques like contrastive learning. However, these transformations are only approximations of the true diversity found in real-world sounds, which are generated by complex interactions of physical processes, from vocal cord vibrations to the resonance of musical instruments. We propose a solution to both the data scale and transformation limitations, leveraging synthetic audio. By randomly perturbing the parameters of a sound synthesizer, we generate audio doppelg\"angers-synthetic positive pairs with causally manipulated variations in timbre, pitch, and temporal envelopes. These variations, difficult to achieve through augmentations of existing audio, provide a rich source of contrastive information. Despite the shift to randomly generated synthetic data, our method produces strong representations, outperforming real data on several standard audio classification tasks. Notably, our approach is lightweight, requires no data storage, and has only a single hyperparameter, which we extensively analyze. We offer this method as a complement to existing strategies for contrastive learning in audio, using synthesized sounds to reduce the data burden on practitioners.</description>

      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>Compositional Audio Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human auditory perception is compositional in nature -- we identify auditory streams from auditory scenes with multiple sound events. However, such auditory scenes are typically represented using clip-level representations that do not disentangle the constituent sound sources. In this work, we learn source-centric audio representations where each sound source is represented using a distinct, disentangled source embedding in the audio representation. We propose two novel approaches to learning source-centric audio representations: a supervised model guided by classification and an unsupervised model guided by feature reconstruction, both of which outperform the baselines. We thoroughly evaluate the design choices of both approaches using an audio classification task. We find that supervision is beneficial to learn source-centric representations, and that reconstructing audio features is more useful than reconstructing spectrograms to learn unsupervised source-centric representations. Leveraging source-centric models can help unlock the potential of greater interpretability and more flexible decoding in machine listening.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Audio-Visual Adversarial Vulnerability from Temporal and Modality Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While audio-visual learning equips models with a richer understanding of the real world by leveraging multiple sensory modalities, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial robustness of audio-visual models, considering both temporal and modality-specific vulnerabilities. We propose two powerful adversarial attacks: 1) a temporal invariance attack that exploits the inherent temporal redundancy across consecutive time segments and 2) a modality misalignment attack that introduces incongruence between the audio and visual modalities. These attacks are designed to thoroughly assess the robustness of audio-visual models against diverse threats. Furthermore, to defend against such attacks, we introduce a novel audio-visual adversarial training framework. This framework addresses key challenges in vanilla adversarial training by incorporating efficient adversarial perturbation crafting tailored to multi-modal data and an adversarial curriculum strategy. Extensive experiments in the Kinetics-Sounds dataset demonstrate that our proposed temporal and modality-based attacks in degrading model performance can achieve state-of-the-art performance, while our adversarial training defense largely improves the adversarial robustness as well as the adversarial training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models. Unfortunately, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Dataset and code is available at https://github.com/ruohaoguo/avis.</description>

Abstract: A novel variant of the Janssen method for audio inpainting is presented. The new method is compared with a number of other popular audio inpainting methods based on autoregressive modeling. Main differences between the particular approaches are pointed out. In the experimental part, the importance of the choice of the AR model estimator is confirmed by objective metrics, and the effect of the chosen AR model order and window size is explored. The results of small-scale and mid-scale computational experiments are in agreement. The results show the superiority of the proposed gap-wise Janssen approach, which is confirmed by a listening test.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction with Reverse Selective Auditory Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) aims to extract the specific person's speech from the audio mixture given auxiliary visual cues. Previous methods usually search for the target voice through speech-lip synchronization. However, this strategy mainly focuses on the existence of target speech, while ignoring the variations of the noise characteristics, i.e., interference speaker and the background noise. That may result in extracting noisy signals from the incorrect sound source in challenging acoustic situations. To this end, we propose a novel selective auditory attention mechanism, which can suppress interference speakers and non-speech signals to avoid incorrect speaker extraction. By estimating and utilizing the undesired noisy signal through this mechanism, we design an AV-TSE framework named Subtraction-and-ExtrAction network (SEANet) to suppress the noisy signals. We conduct abundant experiments by re-implementing three popular AV-TSE methods as the baselines and involving nine metrics for evaluation. The experimental results show that our proposed SEANet achieves state-of-the-art results and performs well for all five datasets. The code can be found in: https://github.com/TaoRuijie/SEANet.git</description>

      <title>Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. This paper presents a comprehensive review of three interconnected digital aquaculture tasks, namely, fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis, using a novel and unified approach. Unlike previous reviews which focused on single modalities or individual tasks, we analyse vision-based (i.e. image- and video-based), acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods across all three tasks. We examine their advantages, limitations, and applications, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical cross-cutting research gaps. The review also includes emerging ideas such as applying multi-task learning and large language models to address various aspects of fish monitoring, an approach not previously explored in aquaculture literature. We identify the major obstacles hindering research progress in this field, including the scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards. To overcome the current limitations, we explore the potential of using emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning to improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of integrated fish monitoring systems. In addition, we provide a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. This holistic perspective offers a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and to promote their practical implementations in real-world settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.</description>

      <title>Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions.

      <title>Sylber: Syllabic Embedding Representation of Speech from Raw Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Syllables are compositional units of spoken language that efficiently structure human speech perception and production. However, current neural speech representations lack such structure, resulting in dense token sequences that are costly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber, that produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that bootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised syllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of speech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable segmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of 4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient spoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and generalizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By training token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be reconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than baseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech into a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we demonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech perception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more categorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the high efficiency of our tokenization. Together, we present a novel SSL approach for representing speech as syllables, with significant potential for efficient speech tokenization and spoken language modeling.</description>

      <title>XLSR-Mamba: A Dual-Column Bidirectional State Space Model for Spoofing Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers and their variants have achieved great success in speech processing. However, their multi-head self-attention mechanism is computationally expensive. Therefore, one novel selective state space model, Mamba, has been proposed as an alternative. Building on its success in automatic speech recognition, we apply Mamba for spoofing attack detection. Mamba is well-suited for this task as it can capture the artifacts in spoofed speech signals by handling long-length sequences. However, Mamba's performance may suffer when it is trained with limited labeled data. To mitigate this, we propose combining a new structure of Mamba based on a dual-column architecture with self-supervised learning, using the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model. The experiments show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and faster inference on the ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF datasets, and on the more challenging In-the-Wild dataset, it emerges as the strongest candidate for spoofing attack detection. The code has been publicly released in https://github.com/swagshaw/XLSR-Mamba.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted Multi-Modal Data Fusion Model for Real-Time Estimation of Underwater Sound Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>
