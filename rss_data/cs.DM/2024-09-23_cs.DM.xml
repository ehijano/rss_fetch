      <title>Expectation and Variance of the Degree of a Node in Random Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Gibbs distribution over all spanning trees of an undirected, edge weighted finite graph, where, up to normalization, the probability of each tree is given by the product of its edge weights. Defining the weighted degree of a node as the sum of the weights of its incident edges, we present analytical expressions for the expectation, variance and covariance of the weighted degree of a node across the Gibbs distribution. To generalize our approach, we distinguish between two types of weight: probability weights, which regulate the distribution of spanning trees, and degree weights, which define the weighted degree of nodes. This distinction allows us to define the weighted degree of nodes independently of the probability weights. By leveraging the Matrix Tree Theorem, we show that these degree moments ultimately depend on the inverse of a submatrix of the graph Laplacian. While our focus is on undirected graphs, we demonstrate that our results can be extended to the directed setting by considering incoming directed trees instead.</description>

      <title>Nesting of Touching Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygons are cycles embedded into the plane; their vertices are associated with $x$- and $y$-coordinates and the edges are straight lines. Here, we consider a set of polygons with pairwise non-overlapping interior that may touch along their boundaries. Ideas of the sweep line algorithm by Bajaj and Dey for non-touching polygons are adapted to accommodate polygons that share boundary points. The algorithms established here achieves a running time of $\mathcal{O}(n+N\log N)$, where $n$ is the total number of vertices and $N&lt;n$ is the total number of "maximal outstretched segments" of all polygons. It is asymptotically optimal if the number of maximal outstretched segments per polygon is bounded. In particular, this is the case for convex polygons.</description>

      <title>On the Identity and Group Problems for Complex Heisenberg Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Identity Problem, the problem of determining if a finitely generated semigroup of matrices contains the identity matrix; see Problem 3 (Chapter 10.3) in ``Unsolved Problems in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory'' by Blondel and Megretski (2004). This fundamental problem is known to be undecidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{4 \times 4}$ and decidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{2 \times 2}$. The Identity Problem has been recently shown to be in polynomial time by Dong for the Heisenberg group over complex numbers in any fixed dimension with the use of Lie algebra and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We develop alternative proof techniques for the problem making a step forward towards more general problems such as the Membership Problem. Using our techniques we also show that the problem of determining if a given set of Heisenberg matrices generates a group can be decided in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The number of random 2-SAT solutions is asymptotically log-normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that throughout the satisfiable phase, the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments of a random 2-SAT formula satisfies a central limit theorem. This implies that the log of the number of satisfying assignments exhibits fluctuations of order $\sqrt n$, with $n$ the number of variables. The formula for the variance can be evaluated effectively. By contrast, for numerous other random constraint satisfaction problems the typical fluctuations of the logarithm of the number of solutions are {\em bounded} throughout all or most of the satisfiable regime.</description>

      <title>Recognition of chordal graphs and cographs which are Cover-Incomparability graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set $V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and cographs which are C-I graphs.</description>

      <title>The Mixed Integer Trust Region Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing a general quadratic function over the mixed integer points in an ellipsoid. This problem is strongly NP-hard, NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor, and optimal solutions can be irrational. In our main result we show that an arbitrarily good solution can be found in polynomial time, if we fix the number of integer variables. This algorithm provides a natural extension to the mixed integer setting, of the polynomial solvability of the trust region problem proven by Ye, Karmarkar, Vavasis, and Zippel. Our result removes a key bottleneck in the design and analysis of model trust region methods for mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. The techniques introduced to prove this result are of independent interest and can be used in other mixed integer programming problems involving quadratic functions. As an example we consider the problem of minimizing a general quadratic function over the mixed integer points in a polyhedron. For this problem, we show that a solution satisfying weak bounds with respect to optimality can be computed in polynomial time, provided that the number of integer variables is fixed. It is well-known that finding a solution satisfying stronger bounds cannot be done in polynomial time, unless P=NP.</description>
