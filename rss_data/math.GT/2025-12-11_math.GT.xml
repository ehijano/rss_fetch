      <title>The Farey tree and embeddings of lens spaces and rational balls in $\mathbb{CP}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Koll\'ar, we study embeddings of multiple rational homology balls in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. To each node of the Farey tree, we associate such an embedding of three rational homology balls with lens space boundary, extending earlier work of the second author and of Lisca and Parma, using a recursive Kirby calculus argument. We also give further explicit constructions of embeddings of triples of rational homology balls into homotopy $\mathbb{CP}^2$s.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for the moduli space of genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weil-Petersson volume of genus-g hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundaries is known since work of Mirzakhani to be polynomial in the boundary lengths. We provide a bijective proof of this fact in the genus-0 case in the presence of a distinguished cusp. It is based on a generalization of a recent tree bijection, by the first author and Curien, to the setting with geodesic boundaries, requiring an extension of the Bowditch-Epstein-Penner spine construction. As an application of our tree bijection we establish an explicit formula for the distance-dependent three-point function, which records an exact metric statistic measuring the difference of two geodesic distances among a triple of distinguished cusps in a Weil-Petersson random surface. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of this function to the topological recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes and metric properties of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with many boundaries or cusps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives a self-contained proof of Mostow Rigidity that has no analytic black boxes. The proof should be accessible to grad students interested in geometry and topology. It has no new research, but I think that this is an unusually clean and analytically light proof of this famous result. I am posting this because I think it will be useful to geometry/topology students.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the number of ends of the mapping class group of a stable avenue surface. We prove that the mapping class group is one-ended whenever the stable avenue surface has at least one end of discrete type. Our method is to show that the associated translatable curve graph, which is quasi-isometric to the mapping class group, is one-ended.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric rigidity for a product of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate quasi-isometric rigidity for the product of a non-uniform rank one lattice and a nilpotent lattice. Specifically, we show that any finitely-generated group quasi-isometric to such a product is, up to finite noise, an extension of a non-uniform rank one lattice by a nilpotent lattice. Furthermore, we show under extra conditions that this extension is nilcentral, a notion which generalizes central extensions to extensions by a nilpotent group.</description>

      <title>Topological median algebra structures on ER homology manifolds I: local cubulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological median algebra structures on Euclidean spaces
  and, more generally, ER homology manifolds. We show that all such
  median structures have a local CAT(0) cubulation structure. We also
  show that topological median algebra structures are completely metrizable as
  median metric spaces if and only if intervals are compact. We give
  examples of both metrizable and non-metrizable such structures, as
  well as provide a construction for producing many non-locally
  cubulated topological median algebra structures on the unit ball in
  Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a way of encoding a Kauffman state as a set of tuples, similar to a Gauss code. Then we describe a procedure for using these state codes to determine the unoriented genus and crosscap number of any prime alternating knot or link. Finally, we compute these values for all such links through 14 crossings and all such knots through 19 crossings (this data is new for links with 10-14 crossings and knots with 14-19 crossings), and we identify several intriguing patterns in the resulting data.</description>

      <title>Equiaffine immersions and pseudo-Riemannian space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an explicit construction that produces immersions into the pseudosphere $\mathbb{S}^{n,n+1}$ and the pseudohyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ starting from equiaffine immersions in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and conversely. We describe how these immersions interact with a para-Sasaki metric defined on $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ via a principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure over a para-K\"ahler manifold. In the case where the immersion in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is an $n$-dimensional hyperbolic affine sphere, we obtain spacelike maximal immersions in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ that satisfy a transversality condition with respect to the principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure. As a first application, we show that, given a certain boundary set $\Lambda_\Omega \subset \partial_\infty \mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$, associated with a properly convex subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{RP}^n$ and homeomorphic to an $(n-1)$-sphere, there exists an $n$-dimensional maximal spacelike submanifold in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ whose boundary is precisely $\Lambda_\Omega$. As a second application, we show that the Blaschke lift of the hyperbolic affine sphere, introduced by Labourie for $n=2$, into the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{R})$ is a harmonic map.</description>

      <title>Random walks on cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of the singularity at infinity of the hitting measure of random walks has a long history, originating from the work of Furstenberg in the 1960s. In 2011, Kaimanovich and Le Prince conjectured that the hitting measure of any finitely supported random walk on a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{SL}_N(\mathbb R)$ is singular at infinity with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Using algebraic and geometric convergence and hyperbolic Dehn filling, we prove the singularity conjecture for certain measures on ``most'' cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups.</description>

      <title>Pants complex, TQFT and hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse perspective on relations of the $SU(2)$-Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT, the Weil-Petersson geometry of the Teichm\"uller space, and volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Using data from the asymptotic expansions of the curve operators in the skein theoretic version of the $SU(2)$-TQFT, we define the quantum intersection number between pants decompositions of a closed surface. We show that the quantum intersection number admits two sided bounds in terms of the geometric intersection number and we use it to obtain a metric on the pants graph of surfaces. Using work of Brock we show that the pants graph equipped with this metric is quasi-isometric to the Teichm\"uller space with the Weil-Petersson metric and that the translation length of our metric provides two sided linear bounds on the volume of hyperbolic fibered manifolds. We briefly discuss how these relations are interpeted from the view point of $SU(2)$-character varieties of 3-manifolds.
  We also obtain a characterization of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes in terms of asymptotics of the quantum intersection number under iteration in the mapping class group and relate these asymptotics with stretch factors. We also discuss how these results fit with a conjecture of Andersen, Masbaum and Ueno about quantum representations of mapping class groups.</description>

Abstract: For any link in the $3$-sphere, we give a visual construction of a stable map $f$ from the $3$-sphere into the real plane enjoying the following properties; $f$ has no cusp point, the set of definite fold points of $f$ coincides with the given link and $f$ only has certain type of fibers containing two indefinite fold points. As a corollary, we obtain a similar stable map from every closed orientable $3$-manifold into the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to model the topology of three-dimensional (3D) continua by Yin sets, regular open semianalytic sets with bounded boundary. Our model differs from manifold-based models in that singular points of a 3D continuum, i.e., boundary points where the tangent plane is not uniquely defined, are treated not as anomalies but as a central subject of our theoretical investigation. We characterize the local and global topology of Yin sets. Then we give a unique boundary representation of Yin sets based on the notion of a glued surface, a quotient space of an orientable compact 2-manifold along a one-dimensional CW complex. Our results apply to 3D continua with arbitrarily complex topology and may be useful in a number of scientific and engineering applications such as solid modeling, computer-aided design, and numerical simulations of multiphase flows with topological changes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by our study of the complex Banach conjecture, we characterize a complex ellipsoids $\mathcal E$ as compact subsets of $\mathbb C^n$, with the property that every complex line intersect $\mathcal E$ either in a single point or in the complex affine image of the unit disk. This characterization leads to the main interest of this paper. We study the topological behavior of compact subsets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with the property that any complex line that intersects them does either at a single point, at the boundary of a complex disk, or along the entire line. In particular, we are interested in quadratic $\R$-algebraic subsets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$.</description>

      <title>The multiple points of maps from sphere to Euclidean space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain some sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of multiple points of maps from $S^m$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main tool is the ideal-valued index of $G$-space defined by E. Fadell and S. Husseini. We obtain more detailed relative positional relationship of multiple points. It is proved that for a continuous real value function $f: S^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(-p)=-f(p)$, if $m+1$ is a power of $2$, then there are $m+1$ points $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ in $S^m$ such that $f(p_1)=\cdots=f(p_{m+1})$, where $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ are linearly dependent and any $m$ points of $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ are linearly independent. As a generalization of Hopf's theorem, we also prove that for any continuous map $f: S^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, if $m&gt; d$, then there exists a pair of mutually orthogonal points having the same image in addition to the antipodal points.</description>

      <title>A note on TQFTs for orientable 2-dimensional cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) are symmetric monoidal functors out of cobordism categories. In dimension two, oriented TQFTs are famously classified by commutative Frobenius algebras. In the unoriented setting, the classification requires additional data: an involution and a value assigned to the M\"obius strip. In this work, we describe an intermediate framework that classifies 2-dimensional TQFTs for orientable cobordisms, in an appropriate sense. Our motivation arises from skein-theoretic models of surfaces embedded in 3-manifolds and Khovanov homology, where surfaces are often treated as unoriented, even though the associated 2-dimensional TQFTs themselves need not be fully unoriented.</description>

Abstract: Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\'esz\'aros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an (2024). In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's aforementioned beautiful result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view.</description>
