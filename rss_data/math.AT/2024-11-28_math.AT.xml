      <title>Combinatorial examples and applications of 2-Segal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introduction to the theory of 2-Segal sets, and two of the main applications of them: Hall algebras and a discrete version of Waldhausen's $S_\bullet$-construction. We present several combinatorial examples and how these constructions can be applied to them.</description>

      <title>Homotopy limits of model categories, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of the homotopy limit of a diagram of left Quillen functors of model categories has been useful in a number of applications. In this paper we review its definition and summarize some of these applications. We conclude with a discussion of why we could work with right Quillen functors instead, but cannot work with a combination of the two.</description>

      <title>Simplicial sets in topology, category theory, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a simplicial set originated in algebraic topology, and has also been utilized extensively in category theory, but until relatively recently was not used outside of those fields. However, with the increasing prominence of higher categorical methods in a wide range of applications, it is important for researchers in a range of fields to have a good working knowledge of them. This paper is intended as an introduction to simplicial sets, both as an overview of their development from other concepts, and as a user's guide for someone wanting to read modern literature that makes use of them.</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- may remain underappreciated as a cohomology theory.
  In illustration and amplification of its cohomological nature, we construct the non-abelian generalization of the Chern character map on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantized 7-Cohomotopy -- in fact on its "twistorial" version classified by complex projective 3-space -- essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model, and we highlight some interesting integral cohomology classes which are extracted this way.
  We end with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>Mix-GENEO: A Flexible Filtration for Multiparameter Persistent Homology Detects Digital Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two important tasks in the field of Topological Data Analysis are building practical multifiltrations on objects and using TDA to detect the geometry. Motivated by the tasks, we build multiparameter filtrations by operators on images named multi-GENEO, multi-DGENEO and mix-GENEO, and we prove the stability of both the interleaving distance and multiparameter persistence landscape of multi-GENEO with respect to the pseudometric on bounded functions. We also give the estimations of upper bound for multi-DGENEO and mix-GENEO. In practical applications, we regard image as a discrete function space, and then we build multifiltrations on the discrete function space. Finally, we construct comparable experiment on MNIST dataset to demonstrate our bifiltrations are superior to 1-parameter filtrations including lower-star filtration and upper-star filtration. For instance, 6 and 9 can be distinguished by our bifiltrations, while they cannot be distinguished by 1-parameter filtrations. The experiment results demonstrate our bifiltrations have ability to detect geometric and topological differences of digital images.</description>

      <title>On a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morse functions are important objects and tools in understanding topologies of manifolds since the 20th century. Their classification has been natural and difficult problems, and surprisingly, this is recently developing. Since the 2010's, results for cases of surfaces have been presented by Gelbukh, Marzantowicz and Michalak for example. We have also longed for higher dimensional cases. We present a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one. We concentrate on Morse functions such that preimages of single points containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori. Existence of such functions implies that the $3$-dimensional closed and connected manifolds are of such manifolds. This has been shown by Saeki in 2006 and we further study structures of these functions.</description>
