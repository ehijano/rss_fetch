      <title>Berezin-Toeplitz quantization revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to a series of works, where we studied the local aspects of the asymptotic action of deformation quantization on the Hilbert spaces $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ of geometric quantization for a K\"ahler manifold $X$; here $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $X$. In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$:
  (1). For a general smooth function $f \in C^\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ as $k \to \infty$. An immediate consequence is their asymptotic locality.
  (2). If $f \in C^\infty(X)$ is furthermore the symbol of a level $k$ quantizable function, then we prove that the associated Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are all holomorphic differential operators. Conversely, Berezin-Toeplitz operators that are holomorphic differential operators all arise in this way. This gives a complete characterization of when Berezin-Toeplitz operators are holomorphic differential operators.
  To prove these results, we construct higher order analgoues of Kostant-Souriau's pre-quantum differential operators using our Fedosov-type constructions in previous works, establish new orthogonality relations which generalize the classical Tuynman's Lemma, and employ various differential-geometric and analytic technqiues such as H\"ormander's estimates.</description>

      <title>Teaching quantum computing to computer science students: Review of a hands-on quantum circuit simulation practical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.</description>

      <title>Algebraic quantum groups and duality I</title>

Abstract: Let $(A,\Delta)$ be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The linear dual $B$ of $A$ is again a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The duality is given by an element $V\in B\otimes A$, defined by $\langle V,a\otimes b\rangle=\langle a,b\rangle$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. We use $\langle\,\cdot\, , \,\cdot\,\rangle$ for the pairings. In the introduction of this paper, we recall the various properties of this element $V$ as sitting in the algebra $B\otimes A$. More generally, we can consider an algebraic quantum group $(A,\Delta)$. We use the term here for a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with integrals. For $B$ we now take the dual $\widehat A$ of $A$. It is again an algebraic quantum group. In this case, the duality gives rise to an element $V$ in the multiplier algebra $M(B\otimes A)$. Still, most of the properties of $V$ in the finite-dimensional case are true in this more general setting. The focus in this paper lies on various aspects of the duality between $A$ and its dual $\widehat A$. Among other things we include a number of formulas relating the objects associated with an algebraic quantum group and its dual. This note is meant to give a comprehensive, yet concise (and sometimes simpler) account of these known results. This is part I of a series of three papers on this subject. The case of a multiplier Hopf $^*$-algebra with positive integrals is treated in detail in part II and part III.</description>

      <title>BPS Lie algebras for totally negative 2-Calabi-Yau categories and nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a sheaf-theoretic cohomological Hall algebra for suitably geometric Abelian categories $\mathcal{A}$ of homological dimension at most two, and a sheaf-theoretic BPS algebra under the conditions that $\mathcal{A}$ is 2-Calabi-Yau and has a good moduli space. We show that the BPS algebra for the preprojective algebra $\Pi_Q$ of a totally negative quiver is the free algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of the closure of the locus parameterising simple $\Pi_Q$-modules in the coarse moduli space.
  We define and study the BPS Lie algebra of arbitrary 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{A}$ for which the Euler form is negative on all pairs of non-zero objects, which recovers the BPS algebra as its universal enveloping algebra for such "totally negative" 2CY categories. We show that for totally negative 2CY categories the BPS algebra is freely generated by intersection complexes of certain coarse moduli spaces as above, and the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of objects in such $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a Yangian-type PBW theorem for the BPS Lie algebra. In this way we prove the cohomological integrality theorem for these categories.
  We use our results to prove that for $C$ a smooth projective curve, and for $r$ and $d$ not necessarily coprime, there is a nonabelian Hodge isomorphism between the Borel-Moore homologies of the stack of rank $r$ and degree $d$ Higgs bundles, and the appropriate stack of twisted representations of the fundamental group of $C$. In addition we prove the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for totally negative quivers; we prove that their polynomials counting cuspidal functions in the constructible Hall algebra for $Q$ have positive coefficients, strengthening the positivity theorem for the Kac polynomials of such quivers.</description>

      <title>BPS algebras and generalised Kac-Moody algebras from 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12592v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of the BPS algebra of 2-Calabi-Yau Abelian categories for which the stack of objects admits a good moduli space. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of certain connected components (corresponding to roots) of the good moduli space. Some major examples include the BPS algebras of (1) the category of semistable coherent sheaves of given slope on a K3 surface or, more generally, quasiprojective symplectic surface, (2) semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve, (3) preprojective algebras of quivers, (4) multiplicative preprojective algebras and (5) fundamental groups of (quiver) Riemann surfaces. We define the BPS Lie algebras of 2-Calabi-Yau categories and prove that they coincide with the ones obtained by dimensional reduction from the critical cohomological Hall algebra in the case in which the 2-Calabi-Yau category is the category of representations of a preprojective algebra. Consequences include (1) A proof in full generality of the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for absolutely cuspidal polynomials, a strengthening of the Kac positivity conjecture (2) A proof of the cohomological integrality conjecture for the category of semistable coherent sheaves on local K3 surfaces (3) A description of the cohomology (in all degrees) of Nakajima quiver varieties as direct sums of irreducible lowest weight representations over the BPS Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Fusion and specialization for type ADE shuffle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Root vectors in quantum groups (of finite type) generalize to fused currents in quantum loop groups ([5]). In the present paper, we construct fused currents as duals to specialization maps of the corresponding shuffle algebras ([7,8,9]) in types ADE. Both root vectors and fused currents depend on a convex order of the positive roots, and the choice we make in the present paper is that of the Auslander-Reiten order ([24]) corresponding to an orientation of the type ADE Dynkin diagram.</description>
