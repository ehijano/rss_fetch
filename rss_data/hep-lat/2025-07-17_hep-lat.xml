      <title>High-precision baryon number cumulants from lattice QCD in a finite box: cumulant ratios, Lee-Yang zeros and critical endpoint predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.</description>

      <title>Efficient Qudit Circuit for Quench Dynamics of $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations $S&gt;1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Probing Hadron Scattering in Lattice Gauge Theories on Qudit Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions and their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter $\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.</description>
