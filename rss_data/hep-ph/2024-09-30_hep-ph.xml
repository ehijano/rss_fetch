      <title>Investigation of the internal structure of the deuteron against the background of two-photon contributions in elastic electron-deuteron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate the simultaneous influence of two-photon effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and logarithmic corrections in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on certain observable experimental quantities (structure factors $A$ and $B$) in elastic electron-deuteron scattering. Analyzing these effects broadens our understanding of particle physics, particularly the manifestations of quark-gluon degrees of freedom in the deuteron.
  Keywords: elastic electron-deuteron scattering, deuteron, QCD, QED, quark, gluon, two-photon exchange effects.</description>

      <title>Tracking Energy Loss in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main modification to high $p_t$ jets evolving in the quark gluon plasma is the depletion of their energy to the thermal background. Despite the prominent role played by energy loss effects in jet quenching, their theoretical description is still limited, being, to a large extent, driven by phenomenological considerations. As the field moves towards the measurement of multi-scale jet substructure observables, it is necessary to develop new field theoretic techniques to describe energy loss. In this letter, we highlight a formal similarity between energy loss, and the renormalization group based track function formalism for computing jet substructure observables on charged particles. We introduce an energy loss function, $L_i(x)$, tracking the energy fraction $x$ flowing from an initial hard parton $i$ down to the measured hadrons, and show that its renormalization group evolution can be studied in perturbative QCD, and is related to that of the track functions. The features of this new approach are illustrated in the computation of projected energy correlators, opening the window to a better theoretical treatment of these observables in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Non-decoupling scalars at future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of BSM models where a generic scalar electroweak multiplet obtains a significant fraction of its mass from a coupling to the Higgs. Such models are non-decoupling: their new states are necessarily at the TeV scale or below, they can significantly alter the electroweak phase transition, and they have a pattern of low energy effects that are distinct from those predicted by SMEFT. Using their minimal gauge and Higgs couplings, we show that a future precision lepton collider (such as FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, or CLIC) can probe all the non-decoupling parameter space of scalar electroweak multiplets, providing fundamental information on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of vacuum-polarization corrections to the self-energy in muonic bound systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In muonic bound systems, the dominant radiative correction is due to vacuum polarization. Yet, for the interpretation of precision experiments, self-energy effects are also important. In turn, additional vacuum-polarization loops perturb the self-energy. Here, we show that combined self-energy vacuum-polarization effects can perturb the bound-state self-energy at the percent level in one-muon bound systems with nuclear charges Z = 1-6. We also update previous treatments of the corrections for muonic hydrogen, muonic deuterium, and muonic helium bound systems.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy neutral leptons coupled to axion-like particles at the LHC far detectors and SHiP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hidden-sector models, axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), leading to rich phenomenologies.We study ALPs produced from $D$- and $B$-meson decays via quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decaying exclusively into a pair of HNLs which mix with active neutrinos. The ALP can be either short- or long-lived, depending on the masses of the ALP and the HNL, as well as the corresponding coupling strength.Such GeV-scale HNLs are necessarily long-lived given the current bounds on their mixing parameters.We assess the sensitivities of the LHC far detectors and SHiP, to the long-lived HNLs in such theoretical scenarios.We find that for currently allowed values of the ALP couplings, most of these experiments can probe the active-sterile-neutrino mixing parameters beyond the parameter regions targeted with the type-I seesaw mechanism in the kinematically allowed mass range. Compared to the case of a promptly decaying ALP, considering an ALP of longer lifetimes weakens the sensitivities of the considered experiments to the long-lived HNLs.</description>

      <title>Hunting for bileptons at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review possible signals at hadron colliders of bileptons, namely doubly-charged vectors or scalars with lepton number L=+/- 2, as predicted by a 331 model, based on a SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x U(1)_X$ symmetry.In particular, I account for a version of the 331 model, wherein the embedding of the hypercharge is obtained with the addition of 3 exotic quarks and vector bileptons. Furthermore, a sextet of SU(3)_L, necessary to give masses to leptons, yields an extra scalar sector, including a doubly-charged Higgs, i.e. scalar bileptons. As bileptons are mostly produced in pairs at hadron colliders, their main signal is given by two same-sign lepton pairs at high invariant mass. Nevertheless, they can also decay according to non-leptonic modes, such as a TeV-scale heavy quark, charged 4/3 or 5/3, plus a Standard Model quark. I explore both leptonic and non-leptonic decays and the sensitivity to such processes of present and future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Axion-Inflation Baryogenesis via New U(1) gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axion-inflation baryogenesis models, embedded into U(1) gauge symmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM), in which the new gauge field couples to the pseudo-scalar inflaton via the Chern-Simons coupling. The motion of the inflaton induces a techyonic instability for one of the two helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of the helical gauge field. It further leads to the generation of the SM particle number densities via anomalies during the reheating, which is sufficient to generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Our numerical results show that this mechanism works for the $U(1)_{\mathbf L}$, $U(1)_{\mathbf R}$ and $U(1)_{\mathbf{B-L}}$ gauge symmetry cases, where subscripts ${\mathbf L}$, $\mathbf{R}$, $\mathbf{B-L}$ indicate the lepton number, the right-handed fermion and the baryon number minus the lepton number respectively. The key point for these mechanisms to work is that the evolution of the number density for right-handed neutrinos is decoupled from those of the SM particles, which shares the same merit as the Dirac Leptogenesis mechanism.</description>

      <title>A comparison of Bayesian sampling algorithms for high-dimensional particle physics and cosmology applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several decades now, Bayesian inference techniques have been applied to theories of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics to obtain the probability density functions of their free parameters. In this study, we review and compare a wide range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling techniques to determine their relative efficacy on functions that resemble those encountered most frequently in the particle astrophysics literature. Our first series of tests explores a series of high-dimensional analytic test functions that exemplify particular challenges, for example highly multimodal posteriors or posteriors with curving degeneracies. We then investigate two real physics examples, the first being a global fit of the $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic microwave background data from the Planck experiment, and the second being a global fit of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using a wide variety of collider and astrophysics data. We show that several examples widely thought to be most easily solved using nested sampling approaches can in fact be more efficiently solved using modern MCMC algorithms, but the details of the implementation matter. Furthermore, we also provide a series of useful insights for practitioners of particle astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A New Avenue for Discovering Charged Higgs Bosons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest searching for charged Higgs bosons via $c \bar b \to H^+ \to W^+ H \to \ell^+\nu t\bar c$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) that possesses flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) couplings, the process is induced by the FCNH top-charm coupling $\rho_{tc}$ without Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) suppression, and may occur if $m_{H^+} &gt; m_{W^+} + m_H$, giving rise to the same sign dilepton signal. We perform a signal-to-background analysis at 14 TeV LHC and find that discovery might be possible with LHC Run 2 data already at hand.</description>

      <title>Improved modeling of $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CERN LHC is not only the current energy-frontier collider for parton-parton collisions, but has proven a powerful photon collider providing photon-photon ($\gamma\gamma$) collisions at center-of-mass energies and luminosities never reached before. The latest theoretical developments implemented in the gamma-UPC Monte Carlo (MC) event generator, which can calculate arbitrary exclusive final state produced via $\gamma\gamma$ fusion in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of protons and/or nuclei at the LHC, are presented. These include azimuthal modulations of dilepton pairs produced in the $\gamma\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-$ process, and neutron emission probabilities for photoexcited lead ions in PbPb UPCs. A few comparisons of the results of the updated gamma-UPC v.1.6 code to relevant RHIC and LHC data are presented.</description>

      <title>Decay behavior of hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically discuss the decay patterns of the hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$ which is assumed as an S-wave $K^\ast\Sigma^\ast$ shallow bound state with its possible quantum numbers $J^P$ which are ${1/2}^-$, ${3/2}^-$ and ${5/2}^-$. By using the effective Lagrangian approach and considering pseudo-scalar meson and vector meson exchanges, we have thoroughly calculated and discussed the decay behavior of the $N(2270)$ molecular state, including hadronic and radiative decay and the cutoff dependence, for different $J^P$ values. For all three cases, $K^\ast \Lambda$, $K^\ast \Sigma$, and $\rho N$ final states are always included as the main decay channels. However, the $K \Lambda$, $\pi N$ and $\pi \Delta$ final states exhibit notable differences. These different decay properties will provide valuable guidance for future experimental searches and aid in distinguishing different $J^P$ assumptions and understanding their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Phenomenology of the Dirac Scotogenic Model: Novel Low Mass Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac Scotogenic model provides an elegant mechanism for generating small Dirac neutrino masses at the one loop level. A single abelian discrete $Z_{6}$ symmetry, simultaneously protects the ``Diracness'' of the neutrinos and the stability of the dark matter candidate. This symmetry originates as an unbroken subgroup of the so-called 445 $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. Here we thoroughly explore the phenomenological implications of such a construction including analysis of electroweak vacuum stability, charged lepton flavor violation and the dark matter phenomenology. After taking all the constraints into account, we also show that the model allows for the possibility of novel low mass scalar as well as fermionic dark matter, a feature not shared by its canonical Majorana counterpart.</description>

      <title>Model Independent Bounds on Left-Right Gauge Boson Masses from LHC Run 2 and Flavour Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left-Right Models (LRMs) are one of the most relevant extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. They introduce an extended gauge sector and can restore parity (P) or charge conjugation (C) symmetries at high enough energies. These theories can be embedded in other more fundamental ones with larger gauge groups. Consequently, the restoration of the C or P symmetries can be pushed towards higher energy scales compared to the scale of the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) of the LRM gauge group. We study three LRMs with different specific realizations of the scalar sector without imposing any additional discrete symmetry on the theory. We present bounds on the masses of the new gauge bosons using data from the LHC Run 2 and study rare meson decays, discussing the structure of the right-handed quark mixing matrix and the impact of the neutrino and scalar sectors. Collider bounds valid for specific LRM realizations are alleviated bringing New Physics (NP) effects in flavour observables closer to an observable level.</description>

      <title>Generation of the CMB cosmic Birefringence through Axion-like particles, Sterile and Active neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic birefringence (CB) angle refers to the rotation of the linear polarization plane of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiations when parity-violating theories are considered. We analyzed the Quantum Boltzmann equation for an ensemble of CMB photons interacting with the right-handed sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) and axion-like particles (ALPs) DM in the presence of the scalar metric perturbation. We used the birefringence angle of CMB to study those probable candidates of DM. It is shown that the CB angle contribution of sterile neutrino is much less that two other sources considered here. Next, we combined the results of the cosmic neutrinos' contribution and the contribution of the ALPs to producing the CMB birefringence and discussed the uncertainty on the parameter space of axions caused by the share of CMB-cosmic neutrino interaction in generating this effect. Finally, we plotted the EB power spectrum of the CMB and showed that this spectrum behaves differently in the presence of cosmic neutrinos and ALPs interactions in small $l$. Hence, future observed data for $C^{l}_{EB}$, will help us to distinguish the CB angle value due to the various sources of its production.</description>

      <title>Preponderant Orbital Polarization in Relativistic Magnetovortical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function clarifies the importance of orbital angular momentum to bulk thermodynamics in addition to the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. In particular, we make an experimentally testable prediction that the orbital contribution should preponderate over the spin contribution, and thus flip the sign of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the strong decays of singly charmed baryons into another singly charmed baryon and a light pseudo scalar meson by means of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory (HHChPT) which combines heavy quark symmetry with chiral symmetry. HHChPT worked excellently for describing the strong decays of $1S$-wave charmed baryons. The strong decay widths of well-established singly charmed baryons are well reproduced. Further, the strong decay width of $1P$ states are calculated in this approach by using the calculated masses in the relativistic flux tube (RFT) model. By analysing the mass spectra from the RFT model with strong decays in HHChPT, we investigate the spin-parity assignments. We identify $\Sigma_{c}(2800)$ and $\Xi_{c}(2939)$ as $1P$-wave states having $J^{P}=\frac{3}{2}^{-}$.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief overview on some of the latest results on the transversity function. We focus on some recent extractions from azimuthal asymmetries data measured in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering processes, and on the impact of transverse single-spin asymmetry data measured in polarised proton-proton collisions on these extractions.</description>

      <title>Distance-dependent interaction between cosmic strings inspired by higher-dimensional gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) strings with the one-loop effective potentials induced by higher-dimensional gauge theory. As our starting point, we consider a five-dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory with an extra-dimensional space $S^1/Z_2$. We numerically show the properties of the strings in our model. Especially, we investigate the interaction force between two parallel strings. We find that the interaction force switches from attraction to repulsion as two strings approach each other at a certain parameter region. This interaction is not observed for the ANO strings with the Mexican hat potential. Furthermore, we find that each different factor determines the interaction between large and small interstring distances. We interpret this difference as the origin of the distance-dependent interaction. Our interpretation can also be applied to other scalar potentials. The results in our study give us a new perspective to understand the interaction between the ANO strings with various scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>The medium-temperature dependence of jet transport coefficient in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medium-temperature $T$ dependence of the jet transport coefficient $\hat q$ was studied via the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_{\rm T})$ and elliptical flow parameter $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ for large transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ hadrons in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Within a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD parton model for hard scatterings with modified fragmentation functions due to jet quenching controlled by $\hat q$, we check the suppression and azimuthal anisotropy for large $p_{\rm T}$ hadrons, and extract $\hat q$ by global fits to $R_{AA}(p_{\rm T})$ and $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ data in A + A collisions at RHIC and LHC, respectively. The numerical results from the best fits show that $\hat q/T^3$ goes down with local medium temperature $T$ in the parton jet trajectory. Compared with the case of a constant $\hat{q}/T^3$, the going-down $T$ dependence of $\hat{q}/T^3$ makes a hard parton jet to lose more energy near $T_{\rm c}$ and therefore strengthens the azimuthal anisotropy for large $p_{\rm T}$ hadrons. As a result, $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ for large $p_{\rm T}$ hadrons was enhanced by approximately 10% to better fit the data at RHIC/LHC. Considering the first-order phase transition from QGP to the hadron phase and the additional energy loss in the hadron phase, $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ is again enhanced by 5%-10% at RHIC/LHC.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum correlators of fermions at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equal-time commutators of different components of the energy-momentum tensor at spatially separated points are calculated for a relativistic quantum Fermi gas at finite temperature and density. Different definitions of such components, also known as different pseudogauges, are used and smeared with a Gaussian profile characterized by the width $\sigma$. In this way, we introduce observables that may represent measurements of energy and momentum in a spatial region of size $\sigma$. We find that the obtained commutators are sensitive to the pseudogauge chosen if the probed systems or the spatial separation are small. The pseudogauge dependence is expected as different quantum operators are analyzed in this case. On the other hand, we find that for sufficiently large probed systems or with large separation, the studied commutators are pseudogauge independent.</description>

      <title>First Principle Predictions for Cold Fermionic Gases Near Criticality via Critical Boson Dominance and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the authors have developed an effective field theory formalism to systematically describe cold fermionic gases near the unitary limit. The theory has enhanced predictive power due to the fact that interactions are dominated by the exchange of a gapped critical boson whose couplings and mass are fixed by matching the dilatation anomaly between the UV and IR theories. We utilize this theory to give analytic predictions for the compressibility and magnetic susceptibility for fermions near unitarity with attractive interactions above the critical temperature $T_c$, with a well defined theoretical error. The inputs to the predictions are: the scattering length $a$, the effective mass $m^\star$ and contact parameter $\tilde C(a)$. We then compare our predictions to numerical simulations and find excellent agreement within the window of scattering lengths where the EFT is valid ($10\geq \mid \! k_F a \! \mid\geq 1$). Experimental corroboration of this theory supports critical point that can be describe by the inclusion of a scalar dilaton mode, whose action is fixed by symmetries.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in the Carrollian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ meson masses at the physical point using rooted staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ meson masses at the physical point and in the continuum limit, based on $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors of rooted staggered quarks. Our analysis includes gauge ensembles at the physical pion and kaon masses spread over six lattice spacings in the range [0.064-0.1315]~fm. Our main results read $m_{\eta} = 543.5(5.6)~$MeV and $m_{\eta^{\prime}} = 986(38)~$MeV, consistent with the experimental values. This is an important numerical test that supports the validity of the fourth root procedure used in the staggered quark formalism. This calculation was the first step towards extracting the pseudoscalar transition form factors of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ mesons that play a crucial role in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, properties of charmonium, bottomonium and charmed-bottom mesons for S, P, D states are calculated with the selection of suitable trial wave functions for the non-relativistic potential model along with the incorporation of spin interactions. These trial wave functions are tested by calculating the masses of ground, radial and orbital excited states of mesons with the variational method. The mass predictions show good agreement with the available experimental data and theoretical predictions found by different methods. This indicates that these trial wave functions are appropriate for further study on mesons. These trial wave functions are used to calculate RMS radii, form factors and charged radii. Results show that RMS radii and charged radii have inverse relation with the masses of mesons, i.e., heavier mesons have smaller radii and vice versa. Momentum dependence of the form factors is studied graphically.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter from inflationary Schwinger production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simple setup with a dark sector containing dark electrons charged under an abelian $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. We show that if the massless dark photon associated to the $U(1)_D$ is produced during inflation in such a way as to form a classical dark electric field, then dark electron-positron pairs are also produced close to the end of inflation via the Schwinger effect even if they are very massive. For large enough dark electric force, dark electrons with masses larger than the Hubble scale can be produced which are non-relativistic at production and throughout their cosmic evolution. They can account for the dark matter abundance today for masses in the range $\sim$ 100 GeV to $10^{17}$ GeV and up to six orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble scale at the end of inflation where purely gravitational production is exponentially suppressed. We examine the regime where the dark electrons do not thermalize with the dark photons throughout their cosmic history and assume negligible kinetic mixing with the visible $U(1)$ so they remain decoupled from the Standard Model thermal bath as well. Thus the final dark matter relic abundance is determined only by the initial inflationary Schwinger production and redshifting after reheating.</description>

Abstract: The paper reports an analytical formula for the production cross section of $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation to hadrons in the vicinity of a narrow resonance, particularly in the $\tau$-charm region, while considering initial state radiation. Despite some approximations in its derivation, the comparison between the analytical formula and direct integration of ISR shows good accuracy, indicating that the analytical formula meets current experimental requirements. Furthermore, the paper presents a comparison of the cross section between the analytical formula and calculations using the {\sc ConExc} Monte Carlo generator. The efficiency of the analytical formula in significantly reducing computing time makes it a favorable choice for the regression procedure to extract the parameters of narrow charmonium resonances in experiments.</description>

      <title>Categorizing $SU(3)_f$ representations of scalar mesons by $J/\psi$ decays</title>

Abstract: The scalar mesons are established for a long time, but their nature is still an open question. In this paper, we investigate the potential of categorizing their $SU(3)_f$ representations via $J/\psi\to SV$ and $\gamma S$, offering a criterion that may illuminate this issue. Here, $S$ ($V$) denotes scalar (vector) mesons. Using the $SU(3)_f$ symmetry with the current data, we find that $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ are mostly made of singlet and octet $SU(3)_f$ representations, respectively, with the singlet-octet mixing angle of $\theta = (82.9\pm4.4)^{\circ}$. This conclusion is consistent with the caculations of the quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) hypothesis. For the scalar mesons in the range of 1-2 GeV, we discuss the mixings between $q\bar{q}$ and glueballs. Our numerical results suggest that $f_0(1710)$ is likely composed of the scalar glueball. We urge our experimental colleagues to measure $J/\psi \to \rho a_0(980,\ 1450,\ 1710), $ $ K^*(892)^{\pm} K^*(700,\ 1430,\ 1950)^{\mp}$ and $\omega f_0(500)$, which provide useful information in the $SU(3)_f$ analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the observed alignment of spots in the X-ray films in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of selected most energetic particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism of generating CP violation through the imaginary part of the interference of two amplitudes is proposed. This mechanism has shown clear evidence in decays such as $B^\pm\to \pi^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$. The proposed mechanism is helpful in searching for CP violation in bottom and charmed baryon decay processes.</description>

      <title>$\rho$ meson transverse momentum dependent parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the $\rho$ meson are evaluated in the framework of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using the proper time regularization scheme. The transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the $\rho$ meson are derived from the overlap representations of the LFWFs. We investigate the $\bm{k}_{\perp}$-weighted moments and the $x$-dependent average transverse momentum $\langle k_{\perp}^n(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ of $\rho$ meson TMDs, $\langle k_{\perp}^n(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ shows the typical transverse momenta of quark TMDs in our model. Our findings indicate that the average transverse momenta of $\langle k_{\perp}(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ fall within the range of $[0.3, 0.45]$ GeV, while $\langle k_{\perp}^2(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ are in the region of $[0.15, 0.30]$ GeV. Our TMDs and parton distribution function (PDFs) satisfy the positive constraints very well. The spin densities inside the $\rho$ meson in the transverse momentum space are investigated, the results show that the quark and the target polarized in the longitudinal or in the transverse directions the distribution are axially symmetric. The unpolarized symmetric distribution when the quark is longitudinally polarized and the target is transversely polarized, or on the contrary exhibit the dipolar distortions. The results of TMDs from LFWFs and the covariant approach are compared. The results show that TMDs from LFWFs satisfy the positive constraints better than TMDs from the covariant approach. The $x$-moments of $\rho$ meson PDFs, $\langle x\rangle_{g_L}$ is larger than the covariant approach. In addition, the quark spin densities of the $\rho$ meson, particularly the $\rho_{\uparrow \downarrow}\left(k_x,k_y\right)=f-\frac{1}{3}f_{LL}-g_L$ in the covariant approach it is negative, but $\rho_{\uparrow \downarrow}\left(k_x,k_y\right)$ from LFWFs is positive.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the weak mixing angle in direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current ton-scale dark matter direct detection experiments have reached an important milestone with the detection of solar neutrinos. In this paper, we show that these data can be used to determine a critical parameter of the Standard Model in particle physics, across an energy regime that has never been probed before. In particular, we show that the value of the weak mixing angle ($\theta_W$) which relates the mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons can be derived from 1) the recent measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T and XENONnT in the sub-GeV energy range -- a regime which is usually only probed by low energy neutrino experiments -- and from 2) XENONnT electron recoil data through neutrino-electron scattering at energy scale $\simeq 0.1 ~ \rm{ MeV}$, corresponding to a momentum transfer region over an order of magnitude smaller than that explored by atomic parity violation experiments. Future observation of neutrinos in the next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments have therefore the potential to provide accurate tests of the Standard Model weak interactions in the keV-MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for the D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the ALICE preliminary results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP may slightly widen the angularity distributions of both inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $10&lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. Additionally, by comparing the averaged angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged one, will suffer more distinct modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities could be obtained because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles. It is also noted that the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite or the large astronomical evidence for its existence, the nature of dark matter remains enigmatic. Particles that interact only, or almost only, gravitationally, in particular with masses around the Planck mass -- the fundamental scale in quantum gravity, are intriguing candidates. Here we show that there is a theoretical possibility to directly detect such particles using highly sensitive gravity-mediated quantum phase shifts. In particular, we consider a protocol utilizing Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axion-photon couplings in compactifications of type IIB string theory. We find that these couplings are systematically suppressed compared to the inverse axion periodicity, as a result of two effects. First, couplings to the QED theta angle are suppressed for axion mass eigenstates that are light compared to the mass scale set by stringy instantons on the cycle supporting QED. Second, in compactifications with many axions the intersection matrix is sparse, making kinetic mixing weak. We study the resulting phenomenology in an ensemble of $200{,}000$ toy models constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke database up to the maximum Hodge number $h^{1,1}=491$. We examine freeze-in production and decay of thermal axions, birefringence of the cosmic microwave background, X-ray spectrum oscillations, and constraints on the QCD axion from supernovae. We conclude that compactifications in this corner of the landscape involve many invisible axions, as well as a handful that may be detectable via photon couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Junction conditions play a crucial role in constructing new gravity solutions. In this paper, we derive the junction condition for gluing together an arbitrary number of spacetimes along a common interface. We develop a geometric technique of reverse extension and provide precise definitions of geometric quantities at the interface. This leads to a geometric derivation of the multiway junction condition. As a cross-check, we independently re-derive the junction condition by varying the action of some specific gravitational models including both Einstein gravity and dilaton gravity. We demonstrate that the junction condition is invariant under a change of frames, and the form of the junction condition is the same for both spacelike and timelike interfaces.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame with a dynamical magnetic field perturbed on a constant configuration. We develop a simple and general algorithm for an analytic solution search that works on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion. This method can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. Applying our method to the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the method finds a complete set of solutions. We obtain two sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time due to the difficulties originating from coupled degrees of freedom and strong anisotropy provided by a magnetic field. The newly developed method resolves these difficulties. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. This identifies the origin of a discrepancy found in recent works. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.</description>
