      <title>Altermagnetic and dipolar splitting of magnons in FeF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeF$_2$ is a prototypical rutile antiferromagnet recently proposed as an altermagnet, with a magnetic symmetry that permits spin-split electronic bands and chiral magnons. Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\sim$35 $\mu$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak.</description>

      <title>Dynamical instability in a Floquet-Driven Dissipative System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the magnon spectrum and distribution function of the antiferromagnetic phase of the Floquet-driven Hubbard model. Above a critical drive strength, we find a dynamical instability, resulting from a change in sign of the magnon damping at a non-zero wavevector. The change in sign means that infinitesimal fluctuations grow with time, corresponding to an instability of the driven state. Implications for the nonequilibrium distribution function and the strong drive nonlinear dynamics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Artificial Gauge Field Engineered Excited-State Topology: Control of Dynamical Evolution of Localized Spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum critical crossover via impurity renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Switching magnetization of quantum antiferromagnets: Schwinger boson mean-field theory compared to exact diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention because of their considerable potential in engineering high-density and ultrafast memory devices, a crucial and increasingly demanded component of contemporary high-performance information technology. Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the N\'eel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \, al.$, \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets. Thereby, the findings of current article pave the way for further theoretical and computational progress in the study of antiferromagnets for engineering spintronic devices with ultrahigh density and ultrafast speed.</description>

      <title>Affordable Five-Orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for Layered Iridates and Rhodates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full $d$-manifold DMFT with numerically exact solvers has remained computationally prohibitive for spin-orbit materials due their scaling and severe sign problem, forcing the community to rely on simplified one- and three-band models that omit the $e_g$ states despite their proximity with the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. We present the first full five-orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations including spin-orbit coupling for the layered iridates and rhodates \bio~and \bro, revealing that the correlation effects shift significantly the $e_g$ states through static mean-field corrections rather than dynamical fluctuations. Motivated by this insight, we introduce hybrid-DMFT (hDMFT), which treats these orbitals and their coupling to the low-energy manifold at the mean-field level while maintaining near quantitative accuracy at a drastically reduced computational cost. These calculation establish hDMFT as a practical and accurate method for full $d$-manifold studies of layered iridates and rhodates, enabling systematic investigations of temperature, doping and pressure dependence that were previously computationally intractable.</description>

      <title>Coupled sawtooth chain exchange network in olivine Mn$_2$GeO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sawtooth chain magnets have been a subject of historical interest in the field of frustrated magnetism, with classical olivine family $M_2TX_4$, ($M$ - 3d, $T$ - 4p, $X$ - chalcogen elements) typically realizing simple $\mathbf{k} = (000)$ states. The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability. We use the best-fit Hamiltonian as the basis for Langevin dynamics simulations and Luttinger-Tisza calculations of the high-temperature commensurate transition.</description>

      <title>Kitaev interactions in the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals materials hosting Kitaev interactions are promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering investigations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, which forms a honeycomb lattice structure at room temperature and exhibits zigzag-type magnetic order below 26.5 K. Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signatures of the field-induced electronic-topological transitions in YbNi$_4$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein paradox describes an incoming electron being scattered at a supercritical barrier to create electron-positron pairs, a phenomenon widely discussed in textbooks. While demonstrating this phenomenon experimentally with the fundamental particles remains challenging, condensed matter analogs are more accessible to experimental realization. For spinless quasi-particles, theoretical works show an enhancement of the pair production rate, and analogs of this effect in condensed matter systems have been studied theoretically. Here, we present another condensed matter system, a heterostructure comprised of two materials with strongly and weakly interacting electrons, that allows for constructing analytical solutions using the hierarchy-of-correlations method. The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.</description>

      <title>Surface chiral Abelian topological order on multilayer cluster Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface states of a symmetry protected topological state can have many possibilities. Here we propose a chiral Abelian topological order on a distinct surface of a multilayer-stacked cluster Mott insulating system. The first-principle calculation and the slave-rotor mean-field theory are applied to study the surface states of the relevant material system. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurement is further suggested to detect the anomalous surface fractionalization of the chiral Abelian topological order on the surface. The connection with real materials is further discussed. We expect our results to inspire the interest in the emergent exotic and correlation physics among the cluster Mott insulating systems and in the interplay between the two different branches of topological phases.</description>

      <title>Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Local Ni$^{2+}$ Electronic Structure to $A$-site Disorder in the Pyrochlore Antiferromagnet NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is a unique example of spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice, but the presence of Na$^{1+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ $A$-site disorder complicates the local electronic and magnetic environment of the Ni$^{2+}$ $B$-site. We utilize resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the influence of $A$-site disorder on the $B$-site electronic structure of NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Ni L-edge RIXS measurements reveal a Ni$^{2+}$ electronic structure in nearly ideal octahedral coordination, with only a small trigonal compression ($\delta$ = -200$\;$meV) required to capture all spectral features. Within the $D_{3d}$ symmetry of the Ni local environment, we extract an anisotropic $g$-factor of $g_{\parallel} = 2.26$ and $g_{\perp} = 2.27$, and a corresponding paramagnetic moment of $\mu_{\rm{eff}}=3.2\;\mu_B$. To simulate disorder, RIXS spectra were calculated with realistic distributions of crystal field parameters; however, these spectra are invariant relative to a disorder-free model, demonstrating the robustness of the Ni$^{2+}$ electronic environment to the $A$-site disorder, within the resolution of our measurement.</description>

      <title>Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Symmetry Disentanglers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Dynamics of False Vacuum Decay in the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.</description>

      <title>Framing Anomaly in Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\pi/12$ as expected: $-2\pi/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\pi/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\pi/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Four-point function of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that, for a range of chemical potentials, the infrared behavior of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) model is governed by a 1D Nearly Conformal Field Theory (NCFT$_{1}$), thereby realizing a continuous line of NCFTs. A finite chemical potential $\mu$ introduces an asymmetry parameter $\mathscr{E}$ into the cSYK fermion two-point function in the conformal limit. In this work, we compute the cSYK four-point function in the conformal limit for an arbitrary value of $\mathscr{E}$ at leading order in $1/N$. We show that the result is fully consistent with the NCFT$_{1}$ structure of the cSYK model and use it to extract the structure constants for correlation functions of two complex fermions with bilinear operators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Correlated Electron Molecular Orbital Materials using Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated electron molecular orbital (CEMO) materials host emergent electronic states built from molecular orbitals localized over clusters of transition metal ions, yet have historically been discovered sporadically and generally been treated as isolated case studies. Here we establish CEMO materials as a systematically discoverable class and introduce a graph-based framework to identify, classify, and organize transition-metal cluster motifs in inorganic solids. Starting from crystal structures in the Materials Project, we construct transition metal connectivity graphs, extract cluster motifs using a bond-cutting algorithm, and determine cluster point groups, effective cluster sublattice dimensionality, and translational symmetry. Applying this approach in a high-throughput screen of 34,548 compounds yields 5,306 cluster-containing materials, including 2,627 stable or metastable compounds with isolated clusters and 984 materials featuring mixed-metal clusters. The resulting dataset reveals symmetry and element-dependent trends in cluster formation. By integrating cluster classification with flat-band lattice topology and battery-relevant information, we provide further relevant information to multiple scientific communities. The accompanying open dataset, Cluster Finder software, and interactive web platform enable systematic exploration of cluster-driven electronic phenomena and establish a general pathway for discovering correlated quantum materials and functional materials with cluster-based or extended metal-metal bonding in inorganic solids.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Classical solution of the FeMo-cofactor model to chemical accuracy and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main source of reduced nitrogen for living things comes from nitrogenase, which converts N2 to NH3 at the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.
  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.
  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Condensation mechanism of high-$T_c$ cuprates: the key role of pairon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that the condensation mechanism in cuprates involves the strong coupling of the condensate to pairon excited states. We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $\Delta(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $\beta_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $\Delta_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments.
  An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $\beta_c$, and not the gap $\Delta_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $\beta_c/k_BT_c\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $\delta_M \simeq 1\,$meV in the excitation spectrum. These results strongly suggest that the same `all-electron' mechanism is at work all along the $T_c$-dome.</description>

      <title>Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</description>

      <title>Triple-well ferroelectricity and kagome-like Chern flat band in two-dimensional multiferroic CuVP$_2$Se$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics that host nontrivial topological bands offer a rich platform for correlated and tunable quantum phenomena, yet such materials remain rare. Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Magnetic Topological Materials Combining Spin and Magnetic Space Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of predicted magnetic topological materials (MTMs) by magnetic space group (MSG) hinders further exploration towards realistic device applications. Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future.</description>

      <title>Beyond the imbalance: site-resolved dynamics probing resonances in many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</description>

      <title>How many-body chaos emerges in the presence of quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic kagome materials has emerged as a versatile platform for dissipationless electronic and spintronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta = 90^{\circ}, \phi)$. In contrast, for fixed $\phi$, the transitions driven by varying $\theta$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Fermionic spinon theory of the hourglass spin excitation spectrum of the cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave (`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Detection of a R\'enyi Index Dependent Transition in Entanglement Entropy Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second R\'enyi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some highly constrained spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and \ren entropies can differ, varying from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the \ren index. Here, we construct a number-conserving many-body state that demonstrates a R\'enyi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling, generalizing previous results to the case of interacting fermions. We introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved R\'enyi entropies that can provide a protocol for diagnosing anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Hidden order in dielectrics: string condensation, solitons, and the charge-vortex duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Description of electrons in a dielectric as solitons of the polarization field requires that the interaction between the solitons (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism) is short-ranged. We present an analytical study of the mechanism by which this is achieved. The mechanism is unusual in that it enables screening of electrically neutral soliton cores by polarization charges. We also argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, which give rise to a topological contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. Recent advancements on these topics are presented including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. The scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures is also highlighted. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models and holographic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare different limits of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ complex fermion with $p$-fermion interactions. First, we compute the fermion Green's function and free energy in the limit of large $N$ followed subsequently by the limit of large $p$. Next, we examine the `double-scaling' limit in which the large $N,p$ limits are taken at fixed $\lambda = p^2/N$. Earlier results on the latter limit are resummed for small $\lambda$, and shown to match our results for the first limit. We also describe the holographic match of our results to two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an additional $U(1)$ gauge field.</description>

      <title>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</description>
