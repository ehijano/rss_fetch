      <title>Substitution in the perturbed utility route choice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers substitution patterns in the perturbed utility route choice model. We provide a general result that determines the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We give a general condition on the network structure under which all paths are necessarily substitutes and an example in which some paths are complements. The presence of complementarity contradicts a result in a previous paper in this journal; we point out and correct the error.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Dynamic Factor Models for High-dimensional Matrix-valued Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional matrix-valued time series are of significant interest in economics and finance, with prominent examples including cross region macroeconomic panels and firms' financial data panels. We introduce a class of Bayesian matrix dynamic factor models that utilize matrix structures to identify more interpretable factor patterns and factor impacts. Our model accommodates time-varying volatility, adjusts for outliers, and allows cross-sectional correlations in the idiosyncratic components. To determine the dimension of the factor matrix, we employ an importance-sampling estimator based on the cross-entropy method to estimate marginal likelihoods. Through a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we show the properties of the factor estimators and the performance of the marginal likelihood estimator in correctly identifying the true dimensions of the factor matrices. Applying our model to a macroeconomic dataset and a financial dataset, we demonstrate its ability in unveiling interesting features within matrix-valued time series.</description>

      <title>The Clustered Dose-Response Function Estimator for continuous treatment with heterogeneous treatment effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many treatments are non-randomly assigned, continuous in nature, and exhibit heterogeneous effects even at identical treatment intensities. Taken together, these characteristics pose significant challenges for identifying causal effects, as no existing estimator can provide an unbiased estimate of the average causal dose-response function. To address this gap, we introduce the Clustered Dose-Response Function (Cl-DRF), a novel estimator designed to discern the continuous causal relationships between treatment intensity and the dependent variable across different subgroups. This approach leverages both theoretical and data-driven sources of heterogeneity and operates under relaxed versions of the conditional independence and positivity assumptions, which are required to be met only within each identified subgroup. To demonstrate the capabilities of the Cl-DRF estimator, we present both simulation evidence and an empirical application examining the impact of European Cohesion funds on economic growth.</description>

      <title>A Distance Covariance-based Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an estimator that considerably weakens the conventional relevance condition of instrumental variable (IV) methods, allowing for instruments that are weakly correlated, uncorrelated, or even mean-independent but not independent of endogenous covariates. Under the relevance condition, the estimator achieves consistent estimation and reliable inference without requiring instrument excludability, and it remains robust even when the first moment of the disturbance term does not exist. In contrast to conventional IV methods, it maximises the set of feasible instruments in any empirical setting. Under a weak conditional median independence condition on pairwise differences in disturbances and mild regularity assumptions, identification holds, and the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler-based characterizations of score-driven updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-driven models have been applied in some 400 published articles over the last decade. Much of this literature cites the optimality result in Blasques et al. (2015), which, roughly, states that sufficiently small score-driven updates are unique in locally reducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence relative to the true density for every observation. This is at odds with other well-known optimality results; the Kalman filter, for example, is optimal in a mean-squared-error sense, but occasionally moves away from the true state. We show that score-driven updates are, similarly, not guaranteed to improve the localized Kullback-Leibler divergence at every observation. The seemingly stronger result in Blasques et al. (2015) is due to their use of an improper (localized) scoring rule. Even as a guaranteed improvement for every observation is unattainable, we prove that sufficiently small score-driven updates are unique in reducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence relative to the true density in expectation. This positive, albeit weaker, result justifies the continued use of score-driven models and places their information-theoretic properties on solid footing.</description>
