      <title>Detecting self-organising patterns in crowd motion: Effect of optimisation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating process of urbanization has raised concerns about incidents arising from overcrowding, necessitating a deep understanding of large human crowd behavior and the development of effective crowd management strategies. This study employs computational methods to analyze real-world crowd behaviors, emphasizing self-organizing patterns. Notably, the intersection of two streams of individuals triggers the spontaneous emergence of striped patterns, validated through both simulations and live human experiments. Addressing a gap in computational methods for studying these patterns, previous research utilized the pattern-matching technique, employing the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm for fitting a two-dimensional sinusoidal function to pedestrian coordinates. This paper advances the pattern-matching procedure by introducing Simulated Annealing as the optimization algorithm and employing a two-dimensional square wave for data fitting. The amalgamation of Simulated Annealing and the square wave significantly enhances pattern fitting quality, validated through statistical hypothesis tests. The study concludes by outlining potential applications of this method across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Epidemic risk perception and social interactions lead to awareness cascades on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The course of an epidemic is not only shaped by infection transmission over face-to-face contacts, but also by preventive behaviour caused by risk perception and social interactions. This study explores the dynamics of coupled awareness and biological infection spread within a two-layer multiplex network framework. One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge. Under these conditions, the combination of a small-world face-to-face and a scale-free social layer, but not vice versa, make that the extent of the infections decreases with increasing transmission probability.</description>

      <title>AMEP: The Active Matter Evaluation Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations, laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as experimental data) of active matter systems. In particular, AMEP also allows it to analyze simulations that combine particle-based and continuum techniques such as used to study the motion of bacteria in chemical fields or for modeling particle motion in a flow field. AMEP is available at https://amepproject.de and can be installed via conda and pip.</description>

      <title>Structural insulators and promotors in networks under generic problem-solving dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective coordination of distributed tasks in a complex system can be represented as decision dynamics on a graph. This abstract representation allows studying the performance of local decision heuristics as a function of task complexity and network architecture. Here we identify hard-to-solve and easy-to-solve networks in a social differentiation task within the basic model of small-world graphs. We show that, depending on the details of the decision heuristic as well as the length of the added links, shortcuts can serve as structural promotors, which speed up convergence towards a solution, but also as structural insulators, which make the network more difficult to solve. Our findings have implications for situations where, in distributed decision systems, regional solutions emerge, which are globally incompatible as for example during the emergence of technological standards.</description>
