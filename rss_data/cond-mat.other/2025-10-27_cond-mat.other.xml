      <title>Suppressing excitations using quantum-Brachistochrone and nearest-neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine excitation suppression in the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where finite-time drive across a quantum critical point is assisted by the presence of a time-dependent coupling parameter. While conventional counterdiabatic protocols are designed to eliminate excitations, they often require complex many-body terms that are difficult to realize experimentally. In contrast, our approach employs a local, time-dependent modulation of an existing coupling term in the Hamiltonian. Within the framework of quantum optimal control, we find that under a linear ramp of the transverse field, the optimal evolution of the second parameter follows a non-monotonic trajectory. For the TFIM, this protocol yields higher fidelity and improved robustness against noise compared to several orders of approximate counterdiabatic driving. Furthermore, we provide an analytical demonstration of anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the presence of noise acting on either the transverse field or the longitudinal coupling. These results highlight the potential of this approach for developing simple, noise-resilient protocols for finite-time quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Validation of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Achieving Pulse Width-Modulated Singular Reflection Angles Without External Power Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a design concept that leverages pulse width variation to enable a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and to autonomously switch reflection properties between two angles without any active control system. Our RIS alters its beam pattern from a singular specular reflection to another unique singular anomalous reflection when the incoming waveform changes from a short pulse to a continuous wave, even at the same frequency. Unlike conventional RISs, our passive control mechanism eliminates the requirements of active components and precise symbol-level synchronization with the transmitting antennas, reducing the system complexity level while offering dynamic material adaptability. We numerically show that the proposed RIS design is capable of varying the received magnitude of an incident wave by a factor of ten, which is also experimentally validated for the first time. Employing binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, we further report that the communication characteristics can be varied by 7 dB or more, which indicates that the proposed design is not limited to a single frequency component as long as the bandwidth of the given signal is covered by that of the RIS design. These results may present new opportunities for exploring and deploying pulse width-dependent RISs in practical scenarios involving next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</description>

      <title>Emission Properties of a Hybrid Metallized Diamond(001) Photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral emission characteristics of a proof-of-concept hybrid metallized diamond(001) photocathode are presented. The quantum efficiency (QE) is shown to be determined by the photo-injection efficiency across the ohmic contact at the back metallized face, whereas the mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted electrons is consistent with a (optical)phonon-assisted and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon mechanism [Phys. Rev. Applied 23, 054065 (2025)] following electron drift transport to the untreated diamond(001) front emission face. Emission is observed from both the lower and upper conduction bands of diamond with positive and negative electron affinity respectively. A potential route to the realization of a red-visible photocathode based on this concept with a sub-50meV MTE and a QE greater than 0.1% is discussed.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Origins of Interfacial Catalysis: Why Electric Fields are Inseparable from Solvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a surge of experiments showing that certain chemical reactions undergo an enormous boost when taken from bulk aqueous conditions to microdroplet environments. The microscopic basis of this phenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key driving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface including the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the surface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we place these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system, we demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous or unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field fluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in activating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a recently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance, which detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric field and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field on the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration including the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution that the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in enhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their actual importance.</description>

      <title>Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\deg}, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</description>
