      <title>The Derivation of Phase-Space Metric in a Geometric Quantization Approach: General Relativity with Quantized Phase-Space Metric and Relative Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various extensions to Riemann geometry have been proposed since the inception of general relativity (GR). The aim has been and continues to be to construct a quantum and dynamic spacetime that incorporates the well-known classical (static) spacetime. Apparently, this seems to enable the principles of GR and quantum mechanics (QM) to be reconciled into a coherent relativity and quantum theory. A canonical geometric quantization approach that presents kinematics of free-falling quantum particles within a tangent bundle, expands QM to incorporate relativistic gravitational fields, and generalizes the four-dimensional Riemann manifold into an eight-dimensional one likely discretizes, if not fully quantizes, the Finsler and Hamilton structures. The Finsler and Hamilton metrics can be directly derived from the Hessian matrix. As introduced in [Physics, 7 (2025) 52], the quantized four-dimensional metric tensor can be deduced by means of approximations including proper parameterization of coordinates and the equating line elements on all these manifolds including Riemann manifold. This research, on the contrary, goes beyond all these approximations and proposes the incorporation of a phase-space metric tensor into GR. The derivation of a quantized eight-dimensional metric tensor is not only presented, but also the implications of it and the corresponding relative spacetime are examined.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in space, time, and motion on the special Galilean group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical mechanics unfolds within absolute time and Euclidean space, yet our knowledge of where events occur, when they occur, and how motion evolves is inherently uncertain. The special Galilean group provides a natural setting for describing classical spacetime, combining absolute time, Euclidean space, and inertial motion within a single Lie group structure. Although this framework is well known, representing and propagating uncertainty on the group has received comparatively little attention. In this work, we bring together existing results on the structure of the Galilean group and use this unified framework to express uncertainty directly on the group manifold. A main contribution is a compact, closed-form expression for the Galilean group Jacobian, which enables principled uncertainty propagation when composing Galilean transformations. We show that uncertainty in spatial position and orientation, temporal displacement, and inertial motion are intrinsically coupled through the underlying group structure. To illustrate the usefulness of the Galilean framework, we consider the problem of estimating a time-varying transformation between inertial frames from noisy observations collected at distinct instants in time. We show that performing estimation directly on the Galilean group yields substantially more statistically consistent estimates than formulations that treat time independently. Together, these results provide a geometric foundation for reasoning about uncertainty in space, time, and motion in classical mechanics, navigation, and robotics.</description>

      <title>Biefeld-Brown effect and space curvature of electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0810</link>
      <description>arXiv:1004.0810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With applying of new proposed electromagnetic gravity Lagrangian together with Einstein-Hilbert equation not zero space curvature was derived. The curvature gives "a priory" postulate of equivalence of mass and electromagnetic field gravity properties. The non zero trace of energy-stress tensor of electrical field changes space curvature of gravity mass, which yields to prediction of dependence of capacitor gravity mass from capacitor capacitance and voltage values, observed in Biefeld-Brown effect. The other, not observed prediction could be applied to coil gravity mass dependence from coil inductance and current values. New physical constant, electromagnetic field gravity constant, was introduced to conform with theoretical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Theoretical calculation of the fine-structure constant and the permittivity of the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.11068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light traveling through the vacuum interacts with vacuum fluctuations similarly to the way that light traveling through a dielectric interacts with ordinary matter. And just as the permittivity of a dielectric can be calculated, the permittivity $\epsilon_0$ of the vacuum can be calculated, yielding an equation for the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. The most important contributions to the value of $\alpha$ arise from the interaction of photons with charged lepton-antilepton vacuum fluctuations that appear in the vacuum as on-shell, bound states. Considering these contributions only to first order in alpha, the fully screened $\alpha \cong 1/(8^2\sqrt{3\pi/2}) \cong 1/139$.</description>
