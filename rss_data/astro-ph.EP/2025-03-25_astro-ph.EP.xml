      <title>Future evolution of 12P and other Halley-type comets in near-polar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the future 100 kyr evolution of six selected HTCs to show their basic commonalities and differences in dynamical behaviour. This includes estimating the probability of sungrazing and flipping. We combined three complementary numerical methods to study the dynamical features: the numerical integrations forwards in time, the Lyapunov time estimations, and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). For each comet, we obtain the osculation orbits from the available observations. We then construct swarms of virtual comets as the basis for all dynamical studies. We show that two comets with q&lt;1.3 au achieve the sungrazing state in the future with high probability: 161P with the likelihood of about 80% will be a sungrazing object with q&lt;0.005 au in the next 13 kyr, and 122P with 50% in the next 100 kyr. We found that both these HTCs reach the sungrazing states due to Kozai resonances with other planets than Jupiter; for example, Uranus acts as the agent of Kozai resonance for 161P. We indicate that the high sungrazing probability for both comets is connected with a high likelihood of orbit flipping. The other four HTCs have a slight chance to be sungrazers after 100 kyr (&lt;2.2%); however, three of them can achieve a high flipping probability. We show that the Lyapunov time and MEGNO indicator give a complementary picture of the orbital stability after 10,000 yr. Results allow us to rank comets from the most to least chaotic, where 161P is a particular case with its high probability to disintegrate due to the Kozai mechanism.</description>

      <title>Influence of jet depth on the equatorial jet direction on giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains puzzling why, despite their similar nature, Jupiter and Saturn possess a prograde equatorial jet, whereas Uranus and Neptune have a retrograde one. To understand this discrepancy, we use a 2-D quasi-geostrophic model to explore how the penetration depth of the jet, regulated by Ohmic dissipation, influences jet patterns. When jets penetrate deeply into the planet's interior, the Taylor column height decreases equatorward in the equatorial jet region, yielding a negative gradient of planetary potential vorticity (i.e., a negative beta effect). The tendency to eliminate such a gradient leads to a prograde equatorial jet, as observed on Jupiter and Saturn. In contrast, a relatively shallow system favors retrograde jets along the equator due to the positive beta effect of geometry. If the proposed mechanism applies to Uranus and Neptune, the observed jet structure may suggest the presence of a stratified layer or Ohmic dissipation layer near their surfaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient and inefficient hydrodynamic escape of exo-satellite atmospheres driven by irradiation from their young giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bolometric radiation from a central body is potentially a powerful driver of atmospheric escape from planets or satellites. When heated above their equilibrium temperatures those satellites, due to their low surface gravity, are be prone to significant atmospheric erosion. Such high temperatures can be reached through a known mechanism: a large ratio of the irradiation to re-radiation opacities of the atmospheric species. We investigate this mechanism for irradiating black-bodies of sub-stellar temperatures and find that specific molecules exist, such as $\rm NH_3$ and $\rm CH_4$, which develop temperature inversions under the irradiation of young post-formation giant planets. These non-isothermal temperature profiles lead to escape rates that can significantly exceed isothermal Parker-model escape rates evaluated at the satellite's equilibrium temperature. Our results indicate that exo-satellites can lose most of their atmospheric mass through this mechanism if the cooling of the exo-satellite's interior is not too rapid. In all scenarios, we find a hierarchical ordering of escape rates of atmospheric species due to thermal decoupling in the upper atmosphere. This thermal decoupling leads to a natural depletion of $\rm CH_4$ and retention of $\rm NH_3$ in our models. We find that giant planets with masses above 2$m_{\rm Jup}$, for cold starts and above 1$m_{\rm Jup}$ in hot start scenarios are able to remove the majority of a Titan analogue's atmosphere. Hence, finding and characterizing exomoon atmospheres in hypothetical future surveys can constrain the post-formation cooling behaviour of giant planets.</description>

      <title>A PR drag origin for the Fomalhaut disk's pervasive inner dust: constraints on collisional strengths, icy composition, and embedded planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the Fomalhaut debris disk have revealed a significant abundance
  of dust interior to the outer planetesimal belt,
  raising questions about its origin and maintenance.
  In this study, we apply an analytical model to the Fomalhaut system,
  that simulates the dust distribution interior to a planetesimal belt,
  as collisional fragments across a range of sizes are dragged inward under Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag.
  We generate spectral energy distributions and synthetic JWST/MIRI images of the model disks,
  and perform an extensive grid search for particle parameters -- pertaining to
  composition and collisional strength -- that best match the observations.
  We find that a sound fit can be found for particle properties
  that involve a substantial water ice component, around 50--80% by total volume,
  and a catastrophic disruption threshold, $Q_D^\star$, at a particle size of
  $D\!\approx\!30\,$um of 2--4$\,\times\,10^6\,$erg/g.
  Based on the expected dynamical depletion of migrating dust by an intervening planet
  we discount planets with masses
  $&gt;1\,M_\mathrm{Saturn}$ beyond $\sim50\,$au in the extended disk,
  though a planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt of up to $\sim2\,M_\mathrm{Saturn}$
  is reconcilable with the PR-drag-maintained disk scenario, contingent upon higher collisional strengths.
  These results indicate that PR drag transport from the outer belt alone can account
  for the high interior dust contents seen in the Fomalhaut system,
  which may thus constitute a common phenomenon in other belt-bearing systems.
  This establishes a framework for interpreting mid-planetary system dust
  around other stars, with our results for Fomalhaut providing a valuable calibration of the models.</description>

      <title>A Refined Cometary Fluorescence Model for the $\nu_{3}$ Vibrational Band of Cyanogen : Application to JWST/NIRSPEC Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanogen ($C_2N_2$) was among the many molecules identified in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Rosetta mission. As a potential parent species of the CN radical, its abundance relative to other species such as HCN should be generalized to comets observed from ground-based facilities. To investigate its presence from infrared spectra in other comets, we developed a new fluorescence model for the $\nu_3$ fundamental band. From new high-resolution infrared spectra of cyanogen, we analyzed the region of the $\nu_3$ band of $C_2N_2$, centered around 4.63 $\mu$m 2158 cm$^{-1}$). In addition to line positions and intensities, ground and excited molecular parameters were obtained. The spectroscopic analysis allowed us to develop a new fluorescence model for cyanogen. Excitation rates of the $\nu_3$ band of cyanogen are presented. An attempt to detect cyanogen in a high-resolution spectrum of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Abiogenesis Timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If two physical timescales are independent, i.e. they depend on different physics, then (statistically) there is no reason to believe that their values should be equal, even to an order of magnitude. The timescale for abiogenesis $\tau_{AB}$, which depends primarily on prebiotic-chemistry, is expected to be independent of the planetary habitability timescale $\tau_{Hab}$, which depends primarily on the sun and therefore on nuclear forces and gravity. Therefore, we expect that either $\tau_{AB} \ll \tau_{Hab}$ or $\tau_{AB} \gg \tau_{Hab}$. The correct inequality is universal and a single example should suffice to resolve this binary choice. Here I argue that, contrary to a well known anthropic selection effect, our existence (which entails life on Earth) can be considered evidence that the correct choice is the former. A Bayesian analysis, taking into account that our existence is old evidence, implies that the probability of the hypothesis $\tau_{AB} \ll \tau_{Hab}$ is &gt; 0.91, assuming equal priors. The Bayes factor, which depends only on the evidence, is &gt; 10 and suggests strong to decisive support for the short abiogenesis timescale hypothesis, according to the Jeffreys interpretation.</description>

      <title>Detection method for periodic radio emissions from an exoplanet's magnetosphere or a star-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exoplanetary or star-planet interaction radio signals is a major challenge, as it is one of the only way of detecting a planetary magnetic field. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations. Identification of periodic radio signal is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique on simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows for characterizing of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as identifying peaks due to resonance or beat periods. We then validate this method on a real signal, using ~1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years to detect jovian radio emissions periodicities (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram allows to correctly identify periodic radio signal, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the synodic period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, but also maybe weaker signal such as the one produced by the interaction between Jupiter and Europa or between Jupiter and Ganymede. It is important to note that secondary peaks in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram will be observed at the synodic and resonance periods between all the detected signal periodicities (i.e. real signals, but also periodicities in the observation). These secondary peaks can then be used to strengthen the detections of weak signals.</description>

      <title>Absence of dehydration due to superionic transition at Earth's core-mantle boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties and stability of hydrous phases are key to unraveling the mysteries of the water cycle in Earth's interior. Under the deep lower mantle conditions, hydrous phases transition into a superionic state. However, the influence of the superionic effect on their stability and dehydration processes remains poorly understood. Using ab initio calculations and deep-learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in delta-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of ionic hydrogen and aluminum within the oxygen sub-lattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute significant external entropy into the system, resulting in exceptional thermostability. Free energy calculations indicate that dehydration is energetically and kinetically unfavorable when water exists in a superionic state under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. Consequently, water can accumulate in the deep lower mantle over Earth's history. This deep water reservoir plays a crucial role in the global deep water and hydrogen cycles.</description>

      <title>Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A benchmark companion at the hydrogen-burning limit imaged in the core cluster of the Fornax-Horologium association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stellar and substellar companions are indispensable objects for verifying evolutionary models that transition from low-mass stars to planets. Their formation is likely also affected by the surrounding stellar environment. The Fornax-Horologium (FH) association is a recently classified young association in the solar neighbourhood with a dissolving open cluster in its centre. It has not been searched widely for substellar companions and exoplanets with direct imaging. We search for companions of stars in the FH and investigate the formation and evolution of companions during the expansion and dissolution of a star cluster. We conduct a direct-imaging survey of 49 stars in FH with VLT/SPHERE. We present HD 24121B, a companion at the hydrogen-burning limit that orbits star HD 24121 in the core cluster of the FH. The companion is located at a projected angular separation of 2.082 $\pm$ 0.004 arcsec from the central star and has contrasts of $\Delta$H2 = 5.07 $\pm$ 0.05 mag and $\Delta$H3= 4.98 $\pm$ 0.05 mag. We estimate a photometric mass of 74.9 $\pm$ 7.5 $M_J$ for HD 24121B, which places it at the boundary of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. It is a new benchmark object for evolutionary models at the hydrogen-burning boundary, especially at the age of 30 - 40 Myr. Orbital fitting with joint Gaia and SPHERE relative astrometry found a high eccentricity for HD 24121B. This suggests that it may have undergone dynamic scattering. Future chemical composition measurements such as high-resolution spectroscopic observations will provide more clues on its formation history.</description>

      <title>A Disintegrating Rocky Planet with Prominent Comet-like Tails Around a Bright Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU. The brightness of the host star, combined with the planet's relatively deep transits ($0.8-2.0\%$), presents BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab as a prime target for compositional studies of rocky exoplanets and investigations into the nature of catastrophically evaporating planets.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

Abstract: When searching for exoplanets, one wants to count how many planets orbit a given star, and to determine what their characteristics are. If the estimated planet characteristics are too far from those of a planet truly present, this should be considered as a false detection. This setting is a particular instance of a general one: aiming to retrieve parametric components in a dataset corrupted by nuisance signals, with a certain accuracy on their parameters. We exhibit a detection criterion minimizing false and missed detections, either as a function of their relative cost or when the expected number of false detections is bounded. If the components can be separated in a technical sense discussed in detail, the optimal detection criterion is a posterior probability obtained as a by-product of Bayesian evidence calculations. Optimality is guaranteed within a model, and we introduce model criticism methods to ensure that the criterion is robust to model errors. We show on two simulations emulating exoplanet searches that the optimal criterion can significantly outperform other criteria. Finally, we show that our framework offers solutions for the identification of components of mixture models and Bayesian false discovery rate control when hypotheses are not discrete.</description>

      <title>Cryoscope: A Cryogenic Infrared Survey Telescope in Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope--a new 50 deg$^2$ field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, $K_{dark}$ survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, and NEO Surveyor. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the $K_{dark}$ passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation. We plan to deploy the Cryoscope Pathfinder to Dome C in December 2026 and the full-scale telescope by 2030.</description>
