      <title>Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA) vs Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA): A Critical Review of Approaches in Operational Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed replacing all approaches for operational risk capital, including the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), with a simplified formula called the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA). This paper examines and criticizes the weaknesses and failures of SMA, such as instability, insensitivity to risk, superadditivity, and the implicit relationship between the SMA capital model and systemic risk in the banking sector. Furthermore, it discusses the issues of the proposed Operational Risk Capital (OpCar) model by the Basel Committee, a precursor to SMA. The paper concludes by advocating for the maintenance of the AMA internal model framework and suggests a series of standardization recommendations to unify internal operational risk modeling. The findings and viewpoints presented in this paper have been discussed and supported by numerous operational risk professionals and academics from various regions of the world.</description>

      <title>AlphaSharpe: LLM-Driven Discovery of Robust Risk-Adjusted Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial metrics like the Sharpe ratio are pivotal in evaluating investment performance by balancing risk and return. However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics to discover enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Supervised Similarity for High-Yield Corporate Bonds with Quantum Cognition Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of quantum cognition machine learning (QCML), a novel paradigm for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks rooted in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, to distance metric learning in corporate bond markets. Compared to equities, corporate bonds are relatively illiquid and both trade and quote data in these securities are relatively sparse. Thus, a measure of distance/similarity among corporate bonds is particularly useful for a variety of practical applications in the trading of illiquid bonds, including the identification of similar tradable alternatives, pricing securities with relatively few recent quotes or trades, and explaining the predictions and performance of ML models based on their training data. Previous research has explored supervised similarity learning based on classical tree-based models in this context; here, we explore the application of the QCML paradigm for supervised distance metric learning in the same context, showing that it outperforms classical tree-based models in high-yield (HY) markets, while giving comparable or better performance (depending on the evaluation metric) in investment grade (IG) markets.</description>

      <title>Defining and comparing SICR-events for classifying impaired loans under IFRS 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IFRS 9 accounting standard requires the prediction of credit deterioration in financial instruments, i.e., significant increases in credit risk (SICR). However, the definition of such a SICR-event is inherently ambiguous, given its current reliance on evaluating the change in the estimated probability of default (PD) against some arbitrary threshold. We examine the shortcomings of this PD-comparison approach and propose an alternative framework for generating SICR-definitions based on three parameters: delinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period. Having varied these framework parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit logistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage and macroeconomic data. For each definition and corresponding model, the resulting SICR-rates are analysed at the portfolio-level on their stability over time and their responsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we compare both the accuracy and dynamicity of the SICR-predictions, and discover several interesting trends and trade-offs. These results can help any bank with appropriately setting the three framework parameters in defining SICR-events for prediction purposes. We demonstrate this process by comparing the best-performing SICR-model to the PD-comparison approach, and show the latter's inferiority as an early-warning system. Our work can therefore guide the formulation, modelling, and testing of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting the timeous recognition of credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.</description>

      <title>Research on Financial Multi-Asset Portfolio Risk Prediction Model Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's complex and volatile financial market environment, risk management of multi-asset portfolios faces significant challenges. Traditional risk assessment methods, due to their limited ability to capture complex correlations between assets, find it difficult to effectively cope with dynamic market changes. This paper proposes a multi-asset portfolio risk prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By utilizing image processing techniques, financial time series data are converted into two-dimensional images to extract high-order features and enhance the accuracy of risk prediction. Through empirical analysis of data from multiple asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and foreign exchange, the results show that the proposed CNN model significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness, especially under extreme market conditions. This research provides a new method for financial risk management, with important theoretical significance and practical value.</description>

      <title>Quantifying firm-level risks from nature deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the loss of value that companies might suffer from nature overexploitation. We find that global equities shed 26.8% in a scenario of unabated nature decline, while the worst-performing firms lose ~75% of their value. Our risk framework considers five environmental hazards: biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change, human population and nature capital. We also introduce two metrics to assess nature-related risks: a Country Degradation Index that tracks the damage caused by environmental hazards in specific territories, including nonlinear dynamics and tipping points; and a Nature Risk Score that summarizes the risk that companies face due to the decline of nature and its services.</description>

      <title>Class-Imbalanced-Aware Adaptive Dataset Distillation for Scalable Pretrained Model on Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced credit scoring technologies. Despite the remarkable efficacy of advanced deep learning models, mainstream adoption continues to favor tree-structured models due to their robust predictive performance on tabular data. Although pretrained models have seen considerable development, their application within the financial realm predominantly revolves around question-answering tasks and the use of such models for tabular-structured credit scoring datasets remains largely unexplored. Tabular-oriented large models, such as TabPFN, has made the application of large models in credit scoring feasible, albeit can only processing with limited sample sizes. This paper provides a novel framework to combine tabular-tailored dataset distillation technique with the pretrained model, empowers the scalability for TabPFN. Furthermore, though class imbalance distribution is the common nature in financial datasets, its influence during dataset distillation has not been explored. We thus integrate the imbalance-aware techniques during dataset distillation, resulting in improved performance in financial datasets (e.g., a 2.5% enhancement in AUC). This study presents a novel framework for scaling up the application of large pretrained models on financial tabular datasets and offers a comparative analysis of the influence of class imbalance on the dataset distillation process. We believe this approach can broaden the applications and downstream tasks of large models in the financial domain.</description>
