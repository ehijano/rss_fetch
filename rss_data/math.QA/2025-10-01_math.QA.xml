      <title>Hochschild (co)homology for odd Khovanov arc algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Hochschild homology and cohomology to quasi-associative algebras, which were defined initially by Albuquerque and Majid and generalized by Naisse and Putyra via grading categories. As an application, we use our construction to give an alternative proof of up-to-sign functoriality for odd Khovanov homology, which was recently proven by Migdail and Wehrli. Our proof generalizes an argument of Khovanov: in doing so, we also give the first proof that the tangle theory of Naisse and Putyra is functorial with respect to tangle cobordisms, up to unit.</description>

      <title>Quantum cluster realization for projected stated ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum cluster algebra structure $\mathscr A_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$ inside the skew-field fractions ${\rm Frac}\bigl(\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})\bigr)$ of the projected stated ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$ (the quotient of the reduced stated ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra by the kernel of the quantum trace map) for any triangulable pb surface $\mathfrak{S}$ without interior punctures. To study the relationships among the projected ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$, the quantum cluster algebra $\mathscr A_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$, and its quantum upper cluster algebra $\mathscr U_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$, we construct a splitting homomorphism for $\mathscr U_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$ and show that it is compatible with the splitting homomorphism for $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$. When every connected component of $\mathfrak{S}$ contains at least two punctures, this compatibility allows us to prove that $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$ embeds into $\mathscr A_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$ by showing that the stated arcs joining two distinct boundary components of $\mathfrak{S}$ (which generate $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$) are, up to multiplication by a Laurent monomial in the frozen variables, exchangeable cluster variables. We further conjecture that these exchangeable cluster variables generate the quantum upper cluster algebra $\mathscr U_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$, which, if true, would imply the equality $\widetilde{\mathscr{S}}_\omega(\mathfrak{S})=\mathscr A_\omega(\mathfrak{S})=\mathscr U_\omega(\mathfrak{S})$.</description>

      <title>Kapranov $L_{\infty}[1]$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any K\"ahler manifold $X$, Kapranov discovered an $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$. Motivated by this result, we introduce, as a generalization of $L_\infty[1]$ algebras, a notion of $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is a differential graded commutative algebra with unit. We show that standard notions (such as quasi-isomorphism and linearization) and results (including homotopy transfer theorems) can be extended to this context. For instance, we provide a linearization theorem.
  As an application, we prove that, given any DG Lie algebroid $(\mathcal{L},Q_{\mathcal{L}})$ over a DG manifold $(\mathcal{M},Q)$, there exists an induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra structure on $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(C^\infty(\mathcal{M}),Q)$ -- its unary bracket is $Q_{\mathcal{L}}$ while its binary bracket is a cocycle representative of the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid. This $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid vanishes. However, the $L_\infty[1]$ ($\mathbb{K}$-)algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ induced by this $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra is necessarily homotopy abelian.
  As a special case, we prove that, given any complex manifold $X$, the Kapranov $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X,\bar{\partial})$, is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle $T_X$ vanishes. Nevertheless, the induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathbb{C}$-algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$ is necessarily homotopy abelian.</description>

      <title>Semisimple Field Theories Detect Stable Diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the work of the first author, we introduce a notion of semisimple topological field theory in arbitrary even dimension and show that such field theories necessarily lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants. The main result of this paper is a proof that this 'upper bound' is optimal: To this end, we introduce and study a class of `finite path integral' topological field theories which are semisimple and which generalize well known theories constructed by Dijkgraaf-Witten, Freed and Quinn. We show that manifolds satisfying a certain finiteness condition -- including 4-manifolds with finite fundamental group -- are indistinguishable to these field theories if and only if they are stably diffeomorphic. Subject to these finiteness conditions, such finite path integral theories therefore provide the strongest semisimple TFT invariants possible. These results hold for a large class of ambient tangential structures.
  We discuss a number of applications, including the constructions of unoriented 4-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish unoriented smooth structure and oriented higher-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish certain exotic spheres.
  Along the way, we show that dimensional reductions of finite path integral theories are again finite path integral theories, we utilize ambidexterity in the rational setting, and we develop techniques related to the $\infty$-categorical M\"obius inversion principle of G\'alvez-Carrillo--Kock--Tonks.</description>

      <title>The Tits construction for short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-super-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Tits construction for Lie superalgebras such that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ acts by even derivations and decompose, as $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module, into a direct sum of copies of the adjoint, the natural and the trivial representations.
  This construction generalizes the one provided by Elduque et al in \cite{EBCC23}, and it is possible to described the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superstructure in terms of $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebras as a super version of the defined by Allison. We extend the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction and the Tits-Allison-Gao functor that define a short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superalgebra from a $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebra $(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{M})$. Our setting includes and generalizes both \cite{EBCC23} and Shang's \cite{S22}.</description>

      <title>On Harish-Chandra's Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the text of a talk given by the first author at the Harish-Chandra centenary meeting held in Allahabad in October 2023. It reviews Harish-Chandra's isomorphism and its many applications to representation theory and mathematical physics. It also announces the existence and uniqueness of nonsymmetric shift operators for an arbitrary root system. These are differential-reflection operators with a transmutation property relative to Dunkl-Cherednik operators: they shift the parameter k of these operators by 1, and restrict on symmetric functions to the hypergeometric shift operators introduced by the first author.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, IV. When the invisible becomes crucial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kontsevich's graphs allow encoding multi-vectors whose coefficients are differential-polynomial in the coefficients of a given Poisson bracket on an affine real manifold. Encoding formulas by directed graphs adapts to the class of Nambu-determinant Poisson brackets, yet the graph topology becomes dimension-specific. To inspect whether a given Kontsevich graph cocycle $\gamma$ acts (non)trivially -- in the second Poisson cohomology -- on the space of Nambu brackets, taking a vector field solution $\smash{\vec{X}^\gamma_d}$ from dimension $d$ does not work in $d+1$. For $2 \leqslant d \leqslant 4$, the action of tetrahedron $\gamma_3$ on Nambu brackets is known to be a Poisson coboundary, $\dot{P} = [[ P,\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_d} (P)]]$. We explore which minimal (sub)sets of graphs, encoding (non)vanishing objects over $\mathbb{R}^d_{\text{aff}}$, generate the topological data that suffice for a solution $\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_{d+1}}$ to appear. We detect that there can be no solution in higher dimension without invisible graphs that vanish as formulas in $d=3$, but whose descendants do not all vanish over $d=4$.</description>

      <title>An introduction to representation-theoretic canonical bases of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
  * Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
  * Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
  * Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
  * Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
  $\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta$ is almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.</description>
