      <title>Vortex Mass in Superfluid Fermi Gases along the BEC--BCS Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex mass is a key concept in the study of superfluid dynamics, referring to the inertia of vortices in a superfluid, which affects their motion and behavior. Despite being an important quantity, the vortex mass has never been observed experimentally, and remains an unresolved issue in this field. As of now, a large body of research assumes that the vortex mass is a local parameter. In contrast, we present a calculation that suggests a logarithmic dependence on the system size, agreeing with some earlier predictions in the context of Bose gases. We analyze the problem using an effective field theory that describes ultracold atomic Fermi gases over the BEC--BCS crossover at both zero and nonzero temperatures. Our study reveals a strong dependence of the vortex mass on the scattering length; in particular, the vortex mass grows rapidly when moving towards the BCS side. Furthermore, we find that the system-size dependence of the vortex mass results in values an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by other models for realistic system sizes. This implies that the vortex mass could be observable in a wider parameter range than was previously expected. This is particularly relevant considering recent advances in experimental techniques that place the observation of vortex mass in superfluid Fermi gases within reach.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism is being actively explored on quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we study the KZ scaling around tricritical phase transition points, with Rydberg atom ladders as a concrete incarnation. The criticality is of Ising and Potts type for two- and three-leg ladders, respectively. When slowly ramping across or near the tricritical point from the disordered phase to the ordered phase, we obtain universal power-law scaling in agreement with conventional KZ predictions. We study a "tangential" KZ ramping that both begins and ends in the disordered phase, a novel protocol enabled by the two-dimensional phase diagram. The tangential KZ directly reveals subleading critical exponents of the critical point. Finally, we explore the regime of intermediate-speed ramping and find a dynamical analog of the celebrated Zamolodchikov's c-theorem. Practically, our work provides an immediately relevant protocol for current experiments to pinpoint the elusive tricritical points. More broadly, tangential and intermediate-speed rampings go beyond the conventional KZ paradigm and introduce new insights into critical quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reflection phase shifts of bouncing Bogoliubov waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved for an inhomogeneous condensate in the vicinity of a turning point, addressing the full continuous spectrum. A basis change in the space of the two Bogoliubov "particle" and "hole" amplitudes is introduced that decouples them approximately. We find a spatially extended mode that governs mainly excitations in the condensate phase, while another mode is localised to regions with density gradients. An analytical and numerical discussion of the phase shift is provided that incident matter waves suffer upon reflection at the turning point, forming standing waves. As an application, we compute eigenfrequencies in a gravitational trap, without recourse to the local density approximation. The non-condensate density at finite temperature and its quantum depletion are discussed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Tricitical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism, describing driven dynamics across critical points based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario (AIS), have attracted broad attentions. However, the driven dynamics in tricritical point with two independent relevant directions has not been adequately studied. Here, we employ time dependent variational principle to study the driven critical dynamics at a one-dimensional supersymmetric Ising tricritical point. For the relevant direction along the Ising critical line, the AIS apparently breaks down. Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\nu_\mu$ with $z$ and $\nu_\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively. For driven dynamics along other direction, the driving rate has the dimension $r=z+1/\nu_p$ with $\nu_p$ being the other correlation length exponent. Our work brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics near the tricritical point, which could be realized in programmable quantum processors in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Itinerant ferromagnetism in an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperature: A DMFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystals in the spin-s Central Spin Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose periodic driving protocols to realize discrete time crystals (DTCs) in a spin-s central spin model. Interestingly, we identify parameter regimes, where eternal period-doubling and higher-order(HO)-DTCs can be realized, even for finite-sized systems. We have determined the dependence of the DTC order on the number of satellite spins and the central spin value, s. Intriguingly, we find that certain classes of HO-DTCs produce a series of maximally entangled Bell cat and super-cat states during their dynamical evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the HO-DTCs can be employed for quantum-enhanced multiparameter sensing at the Heisenberg limit.</description>

Abstract: We review some unresolved theoretical issues in three-dimensional two-component Fermi gases, drawing on recent experiments on cold atoms in immaterial traps close to a magnetic Feshbach resonance. We distinguish successively (i) the open questions arising in the few-body problem with Wigner-Bethe-Peierls contact interactions - essentially the stability of the gas with respect to the Efimov effect and the calculation of the cluster (or virial) coefficients, (ii) those arising in the effective low-energy theory of Landau and Khalatnikov quantum hydrodynamics - essentially the damping of phonon modes and the coherence time of the condensate of pairs, and finally (iii) questions requiring a complete, microscopic solution of the many-body problem, such as the specific properties of the acoustic excitation branch (Goldstone) of the condensate of pairs, or its collective excitation branch (Higgs) in the broken-pair continuum.</description>

      <title>Observation of Brownian Motion of a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of classical Brownian motion in momentum space by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms prepared in a hexagonal optical lattice. Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional. These results suggest that combining the curved geometry with finite angular momentum may give rise to qualitatively new many-body phenomena in ultracold shell-shaped gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the right set of circumstances, ultracold quantum gases are able to change character and condense into a liquid state of quantum droplets. The size distribution of the droplets is determined dynamically in the condensation process. A semi-quantitative argument is presented which suggests that, at zero temperature, a multiple droplet system has is a preferred scale $\propto v^{-1/3}$, where $v$ is the rate of change of parameters at the time of droplet formation. Numerical simulations of two dimensional systems strongly support a power law $v^{-d}$, with an exponent $d\in(0.327,0.375)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Inverse Participation Ratio Estimation in multi-qubit and multi-qudit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) and the related Participation Entropies quantify the spread of a quantum state over a selected basis of the Hilbert space, offering insights into the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the system. In this work, we propose three quantum algorithms to estimate IPRs on multi-qubit and multi-qudit quantum devices. The first algorithm allows for the estimation of IPRs in the computational basis by single-qubit measurements, while the second one enables measurement of IPR in the eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian, without the knowledge about the eigenstates of the system. Next, we provide an algorithm for IPR in the computational basis for a multi-qudit system. We discuss resources required by the algorithms and benchmark them by investigating the one-axis twisting protocol, the thermalization in a deformed PXP model, and the ground state of a spin-$1$ AKLT chain in a transverse field.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>
