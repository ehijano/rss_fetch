      <title>Long coherence silicon spin qubit fabricated in a 300 mm industrial foundry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $\delta \varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum Polarization in Thouless Topological Charge Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O &gt; N_C$ or $N_C &gt; N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Approach to Relaxation Time of Magnetic Nanoparticles With Interactions: From Superparamagnetic Behavior to Spin-Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel theoretical expression for the relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticles with dipolar interactions is derived from Kramers' theory, extending the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework to incorporate Tsallis statistics. The model provides, for the first time, a unified description of magnetic relaxation from weakly to strongly interacting regimes, culminating in a spin-glass transition. It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of N\'eel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Charge Transfer and Electronic Structure Modulation in Ultrathin Graphene P3HT Hybrid Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin polymer-graphene heterostructures are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies, while the influence of the polymer's structural variation on interfacial charge transfer remains unclear. Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>A voltage-responsive strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin network with emergent dynamics for computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent behavior,which arises from local interactions between simple elements,is pervasive in nature. It underlies the exceptional energy-efficient computing in our brains. However,realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge.Here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients,i.e.strong dipolar coupling enabled by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, the largest reported to date, and a disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks calibrated to experiments, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, which are characteristic of strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions.It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable,low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.</description>

      <title>Holonomic multi-controlled gates for single-photon states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled and multi-controlled quantum gates, whose action on a target qubit depends on the state of multiple control qubits, represent a fundamental logical building block for complex quantum algorithms. We propose a scheme for realizing this class of gates based on non-Abelian holonomies in modulated photonic waveguide networks. Our approach relies on linear photonic cicuits formed by two star networks coupled via a two-path circuit. A star network with M peripheral waveguides coupled to a single central site, or M-pod, naturally generalizes the tripod structure used in non-Abelian Thouless pumping and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). In the present work, we first analyze the minimal case of two connected tripods and design adiabatic driving loops that implement single-qubit, CNOT, and SWAP gates. We then show how extending the approach to larger M-pod structures enables the realization of multiply controlled operations, which we exemplify by designing Toffoli and the OR gate on two coupled pentapods. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of connected tripods can implement the Deutsch quantum query algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling photothermal forces and backaction in nano-optomechanical resonators through strain engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning.</description>

      <title>3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\'e materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electron transport in molecular nanojunctions that are driven by incoherent radiation using Markovian quantum dynamics based on the Lindblad quantum master equation. General expressions for the transient electron and photon currents between system and reservoir are derived. For experimentally relevant nanojunction configurations that include on-site Coulomb repulsion, electron tunneling, spontaneous photon emission, and incoherent driving, we show that Lindblad theory can reproduce stationary conductance features reported in the literature such as negative differential conductance, Coulomb blockade, and current-induced light emission. Light-induced currents are predicted for two-site configurations with ground-level tunneling when the incoherent driving rate is comparable with the transfer rate to contact electrodes. Model extensions to include coherent light-matter interaction are suggested.</description>

Abstract: We consider a rhombohedral-stacked $N$-layer graphene coupled to a monolayer of Haldane model. We show that high order Dirac points in multilayer graphene can be gapped out by topological proximity effect of the Haldane model layer, leading to total Chern number $|C|=N+1$ quantum anomalous Hall states. This provides a new way to construct high Chern number quantum anomalous Hall states in realistic crystalline graphene systems.</description>

Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</description>

Abstract: Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena and engineering novel material properties in two dimensions, potentially revolutionizing developments in spintronics. This Review provides an overview of recent progress on emerging moir\'e spintronics in twisted vdW materials, with a particular focus on two-dimensional magnetic materials. Following a brief introduction to the general features of twisted vdW materials, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental studies on stacking-dependent interlayer magnetism, non-collinear spin textures, moir\'e magnetic exchange interactions, moir\'e skyrmions and moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the potential of machine learning to accelerate the discovery and design of multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics. Finally, we conclude by addressing the most pressing challenges and potential opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in large-angle twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge conservation and ballistic magnetotransport in a disordered Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved. This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Mott Insulator with Thermally Induced Melting Behavior in Kagome Compound Nb3Cl8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description>

Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekul\`{e} superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a unique multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90\degree$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens other avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>
