      <title>Accessing the Gluon Momentum Fraction of Nucleons through the Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon momentum fraction of the nucleon using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with a nonperturbative renormalization technique based on the gradient flow. The gluon momentum fraction is determined on a single Wilson-clover ensemble using Nf = 2+1 flavors with pion mass 358 MeV and lattice spacing 0.094 fm. We employ the variational method to reduce excited-state contamination and apply the distillation framework to ensure a large operator basis. To reduce systematic uncertainties, we apply Bayesian model averaging to all fit procedures. We apply matching coefficients to the flow-time dependent lattice results to recover the gluon momentum fraction in the MS-scheme at 2 GeV. Our final result is &lt;x&gt;_g(\mu = 2 GeV) = 0.482(35), where we quote only statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision solvers with half-precision floating point numbers for Lattice QCD on A64FX processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of half-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) in mixed-precision linear solvers for lattice QCD simulations. Since the emergence of GPUs for general-purpose, mixed-precision algorithms that combine single-precision (FP32) with double-precision (FP64) arithmetics have become widely used in this field and others. While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use. We believe that the proposed rescaling methods can also benefit other mixed precision preconditioners in avoiding underflows.</description>

      <title>Accelerating iterative linear equation solver using modified domain-wall fermion matrix in lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU.</description>

      <title>RG-Invariant Symmetry Ratio for QCD: A Study of $U(1)_A$ and Chiral Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $\kappa_{AB}$, for the quantitative characterization of symmetry breaking in QCD. As a first application, we employ $\kappa_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($\kappa_{PS}$), probing the $\pi$-$\delta$ system; the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($\kappa_{VA}$), probing the $\rho$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($\kappa_{TX}$), probing the $\rho$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $\kappa_{PS} &gt; \kappa_{TX} \sim \kappa_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are suppressed.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13124v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Predictions for the $\Sigma$ Dirac Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to the Dirac electromagnetic form factors of the $\Sigma$ hyperons within the hard-collinear factorization framework at leading power. The corresponding short-distance coefficient functions are extracted from the relevant seven-point partonic correlation functions. We find that the one-loop radiative corrections to the leading-twist hard-scattering contributions are numerically significant over a broad range of momentum transfer. Combining the perturbatively calculated hard kernels with nonperturbative $\Sigma$ distribution amplitudes determined from lattice QCD, we present state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for the $\Sigma$ hyperon electromagnetic form factors.</description>

      <title>Factorization formula connecting the $\Lambda_Q$ LCDA in QCD and boosted HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are essential to precision phenomenology in heavy baryon decays. In this work, we derive a factorization formula connecting the leading-twist QCD LCDA to the boosted HQET LCDA of the $\Lambda_Q$ baryon in the peak region. We demonstrate a significant simplification of the matching procedure by applying the method-of-regions to perturbative calculations. With this simplification, we calculate the required one-loop perturbative corrections to the QCD and boosted HQET LCDAs in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, and thereby obtain the one-loop jet function that serves as the matching kernel in the factorization formula. This result provides a critical step toward lattice QCD calculation of heavy baryon LCDAs in the future.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of chiral symmetry breaking and the conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the vacuum as a function of quark flavor number $N_f$ within the chiral limit. By self-consistently solving the coupled DSEs for the quark and gluon propagators in a minimal QCD scheme, we elucidate the nonperturbative dynamics governing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\langle\bar{\psi} {\psi}\rangle\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.</description>

      <title>Implementing the three-neutron quantization condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Study of multi-particle states with tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model using a spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method. We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using L\"uscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction.</description>

      <title>Exotic $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ states in Born-Oppenheimer approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration and study mass spectrum and root-mean-square radius values. For this purpose, we use dynamical diquark model. We assume that strange quark is a heavy for the usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Our results strongly indicate that the $T_{c\overline{s}0}^{a}(2900)$ states are best described as composed of axial-vector (spin-1) diquark pairs. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square radius, $\langle r^{2}\rangle^{1/2} \approx 0.70-0.80$ fm, which is significantly less than 1 fm, provides compelling evidence that these are compact tetraquarks rather than loosely bound hadronic molecules.</description>
