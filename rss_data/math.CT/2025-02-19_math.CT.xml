      <title>Gorenstein categories relative to G-admissible triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the notion of Gorenstein categories relative to G-admissible triples. This is a relativization of the concept of Gorenstein category (an abelian category with enough projective and injective objects, in which the suprema of the sets $\{ {\rm pd}(I) \ \text{:} \ I \text{ is injective} \}$ and $\{ {\rm id}(P) \ \text{:} \ P \text{ is projective} \}$ are finite). Such categories turn out to be a suitable setting on which it is possible to obtain hereditary abelian model structures where the (co)fibrant objects are Gorenstein injective (resp., Gorenstein projective) objects relative to GI-admissible (resp., GP-admissible) pairs. Applications and examples of these structures are given. Moreover, we link relative Gorenstein categories with tilting theory and obtain relations between different relative homological dimensions.</description>

      <title>On extensivity of morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensivity of a category may be described as a property of coproducts in the category, namely, that they are disjoint and universal. An alternative viewpoint is that it is a property of morphisms in a category. This paper explores this point of view through a natural notion of extensive and coextensive morphism. Through these notions, topics in universal algebra, such as the strict refinement and Fraser-Horn properties, take categorical form and thereby enjoy the benefits of categorical generalisation. On the other hand, the universal algebraic theory surrounding these topics inspire categorical results. One such result we establish in this paper is that a Barr-exact category is coextensive if and only if every split monomorphism in the category is coextensive.</description>

      <title>Classical notions of computation and the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. Building on the work of the third author, we devise the notion of dialogue duploid, which provides a non-associative and effectful counterpart to the notion of dialogue category introduced by the second author in his 2-categorical account, based on adjunctions, of logical polarities and continuations. We show that the syntax of the polarised calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).</description>

      <title>A categorical representation of games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strategic games admit a multi-graph representation, in which two kinds of relations, accessibility, and preferences, are used to describe how the players compare the possible outcomes. A category of games with a fixed set of players $\mathbf{Gam}_I$ is built from this representation, and a more general category $\mathbf{Gam}$ is defined with games having different sets of players, both being complete and cocomplete. The notion of Nash equilibrium can be generalized in this context. We then introduce two subcategories of $\mathbf{Gam}$, $\mathbf{NE}$ and $\mathbf{Gam}^{NE}$ in which the morphisms are equilibria-preserving. We illustrate the expressivity and usefulness of this framework with some examples.</description>

      <title>The Bicategory of Lie Groupoids within Diffeological Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the localisation of the 2-category of diffeological groupoids at weak equivalences from the perspective of anafunctors, and with this language, prove that the localisation of the 2-category of Lie groupoids is an essentially full sub-bicategory of that of diffeological groupoids. In particular, we solve the open problem affirmatively of whether two Lie groupoids that are diffeologically Morita equivalent are Morita equivalent in the usual Lie sense.</description>
