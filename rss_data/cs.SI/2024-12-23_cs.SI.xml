      <title>Deciphering Social Behaviour: a Novel Biological Approach For Social Users Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms continue to struggle with the growing presence of social bots-automated accounts that can influence public opinion and facilitate the spread of disinformation. Over time, these social bots have advanced significantly, making them increasingly difficult to distinguish from genuine users. Recently, new groups of bots have emerged, utilizing Large Language Models to generate content for posting, further complicating detection efforts. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses algorithms to measure the similarity between DNA strings, commonly used in biological contexts, to classify social users as bots or not. Our approach begins by clustering social media users into distinct macro species based on the similarities (and differences) observed in their timelines. These macro species are subsequently classified as either bots or genuine users, using a novel metric we developed that evaluates their behavioral characteristics in a way that mirrors biological comparison methods. This study extends beyond past approaches that focus solely on identical behaviors via analyses of the accounts' timelines. By incorporating new metrics, our approach systematically classifies non-trivial accounts into appropriate categories, effectively peeling back layers to reveal non-obvious species.</description>

      <title>From your Block to our Block: How to Find Shared Structure between Stochastic Block Models over Multiple Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) are a popular approach to modeling single real-world graphs. The key idea of SBMs is to partition the vertices of the graph into blocks with similar edge densities within, as well as between different blocks. However, what if we are given not one but multiple graphs that are unaligned and of different sizes? How can we find out if these graphs share blocks with similar connectivity structures? In this paper, we propose the shared stochastic block modeling (SSBM) problem, in which we model $n$ graphs using SBMs that share parameters of $s$ blocks. We show that fitting an SSBM is NP-hard, and consider two approaches to fit good models in practice. In the first, we directly maximize the likelihood of the shared model using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second, we first fit an SBM for each graph and then select which blocks to share. We propose an integer linear program to find the optimal shared blocks and to scale to large numbers of blocks, we propose a fast greedy algorithm. Through extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our methods work well in practice.</description>

      <title>Climate Policy Elites' Twitter Interactions across Nine Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identified the Twitter accounts of 941 climate change policy actors across nine countries, and collected their activities from 2017--2022, totalling 48 million activities from 17,700 accounts at different organizational levels. There is considerable temporal and cross-national variation in how prominent climate-related activities were, but all national policy systems generally responded to climate-related events, such as climate protests, in a similar manner. Examining patterns of interaction within and across countries, we find that these national policy systems rarely directly interact with one another, but are connected through consistently engaging with the same content produced by accounts of international organizations, climate activists, and researchers.</description>

      <title>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Tracking the 2024 US Presidential Election Chatter on TikTok: A Public Multimodal Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the TikTok 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Dataset, a large-scale, resource designed to advance research into political communication and social media dynamics. The dataset comprises 3.14 million videos published on TikTok between November 1, 2023, and October 16, 2024, encompassing video ids and transcripts. Data collection was conducted using the TikTok Research API with a comprehensive set of election-related keywords and hashtags, supplemented by third-party tools to address API limitations and expand content coverage, enabling analysis of hashtag co-occurrence networks that reveal politically aligned hashtags based on ideological affiliations, the evolution of top hashtags over time, and summary statistics that highlight the dataset's scale and richness. This dataset offers insights into TikTok's role in shaping electoral discourse by providing a multimodal view of election-related content. It enables researchers to explore critical topics such as coordinated messaging, misinformation spread, audience engagement, and linguistic trends. The TikTok 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Dataset is publicly available and aims to contribute to the broader understanding of social media's impact on democracy and public opinion.</description>

      <title>Safe Spaces or Toxic Places? Content Moderation and Social Dynamics of Online Eating Disorder Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become critical spaces for discussing mental health concerns, including eating disorders. While these platforms can provide valuable support networks, they may also amplify harmful content that glorifies disordered cognition and self-destructive behaviors. While social media platforms have implemented various content moderation strategies, from stringent to laissez-faire approaches, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how these different moderation practices interact with user engagement in online communities around these sensitive mental health topics. This study addresses this knowledge gap through a comparative analysis of eating disorder discussions across Twitter/X, Reddit, and TikTok. Our findings reveal that while users across all platforms engage similarly in expressing concerns and seeking support, platforms with weaker moderation (like Twitter/X) enable the formation of toxic echo chambers that amplify pro-anorexia rhetoric. These results demonstrate how moderation strategies significantly influence the development and impact of online communities, particularly in contexts involving mental health and self-harm.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Reliability Criteria for News Publishers with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of a large language model to assist in the evaluation of the reliability of the vast number of existing online news publishers, addressing the impracticality of relying solely on human expert annotators for this task. In the context of the Italian news media market, we first task the model with evaluating expert-designed reliability criteria using a representative sample of news articles. We then compare the model's answers with those of human experts. The dataset consists of 340 news articles, each annotated by two human experts and the LLM. Six criteria are taken into account, for a total of 6,120 annotations. We observe good agreement between LLM and human annotators in three of the six evaluated criteria, including the critical ability to detect instances where a text negatively targets an entity or individual. For two additional criteria, such as the detection of sensational language and the recognition of bias in news content, LLMs generate fair annotations, albeit with certain trade-offs. Furthermore, we show that the LLM is able to help resolve disagreements among human experts, especially in tasks such as identifying cases of negative targeting.</description>

      <title>The Content Moderator's Dilemma: Removal of Toxic Content and Distortions to Online Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an ongoing debate about how to moderate toxic speech on social media and how content moderation affects online discourse. We propose and validate a methodology for measuring the content-moderation-induced distortions in online discourse using text embeddings from computational linguistics. We test our measure on a representative dataset of 5 million US political Tweets and find that removing toxic Tweets distorts online content. This finding is consistent across different embedding models, toxicity metrics, and samples. Importantly, we demonstrate that content-moderation-induced distortions are not caused by the toxic language. Instead, we show that, as a side effect, content moderation shifts the mean and variance of the embedding space, distorting the topic composition of online content. Finally, we propose an alternative approach to content moderation that uses generative Large Language Models to rephrase toxic Tweets to preserve their salvageable content rather than removing them entirely. We demonstrate that this rephrasing strategy reduces toxicity while minimizing distortions in online content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event detection in text streams is a crucial task for the analysis of online media and social networks. One of the current challenges in this field is establishing a performance standard while maintaining an acceptable level of computational complexity. In our study, we use an incremental clustering algorithm combined with recent advancements in sentence embeddings. Our objective is to compare our findings with previous studies, specifically those by Cao et al. (2024) and Mazoyer et al. (2020). Our results demonstrate significant improvements and could serve as a relevant baseline for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Empirical Study on Large Language Models for Election Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) accurately predict election outcomes? While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in healthcare, legal analysis, and creative applications, their capabilities in election forecasting remain uncertain. Notably, election prediction poses unique challenges: limited voter-level data, evolving political contexts, and the complexity of modeling human behavior. In the first part of this paper, we explore and introduce a multi-step reasoning framework for election prediction, which systematically integrates demographic, ideological, and time-sensitive factors. Validated on 2016 and 2020 real-world data and extensive synthetic personas, our approach adapts to changing political landscapes, reducing bias and significantly improving predictive accuracy. We further apply our pipeline to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, illustrating its ability to generalize beyond observed historical data. Beyond enhancing accuracy, the second part of the paper provides insights into the broader implications of LLM-based election forecasting. We identify potential political biases embedded in pretrained corpora, examine how demographic patterns can become exaggerated, and suggest strategies for mitigating these issues. Together, this project, a large-scale LLM empirical study, advances the accuracy of election predictions and establishes directions for more balanced, transparent, and context-aware modeling in political science research and practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for extending Ricci flow to hypergraphs by defining probability measures on the edges and transporting them on the line expansion. This approach yields a new weighting on the edges, which proves particularly effective for community detection. We extensively compare this method with a similar notion of Ricci flow defined on the clique expansion, demonstrating its enhanced sensitivity to the hypergraph structure, especially in the presence of large hyperedges. The two methods are complementary and together form a powerful and highly interpretable framework for community detection in hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Limited Mobility on the Experienced Segregation of Foreign-born Minorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segregation is a key challenge in promoting more diverse and inclusive cities. Research based on large-scale mobility data indicates that segregation between majority and minority groups persists in daily activities beyond residential areas, like visiting shops and restaurants. Aspects including lifestyle differences, homophily, and mobility constraints have been proposed as drivers of this phenomenon, but their contributions remain poorly quantified. Here, we elucidate how different mechanisms influence segregation outside home, looking at the distinctive segregation experienced by native and foreign-born individuals. Our study is based on the movement of ~320,000 individual smartphone devices collected in Sweden, where immigration creates profound divides. We find that while day-to-day activities lead to mixing for native-born individuals, foreign-born individuals remain segregated in their out-of-home activities. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that this heterogeneous effect of mobility on experienced segregation results mainly from two mechanisms: homophily and limited travel, i.e. foreign-born individuals (i) tend to visit destinations visited by similar individuals, and (ii) have limited mobility ranges. We show that homophily, as represented by destination preference, plays a minor role, while limited mobility, associated with reduced transport access, limits opportunities for foreign-born minorities to diversify their encounters. Our findings suggest that enhancing transport accessibility in foreign-born concentrated areas could reduce social segregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Embedding by Approximate Equitable Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Linear Regression Models for Opinion Formation in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider public health officials aiming to spread awareness about a new vaccine in a community interconnected by a social network. How can they distribute information with minimal resources, so as to avoid polarization and ensure community-wide convergence of opinion? To tackle such challenges, we initiate the study of sample complexity of opinion convergence in networks. Our framework is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard the opinion of each agent as a data-derived model, unlike previous works that treat opinions as data-independent scalars. The opinion model for every agent is initially learned from its local samples and evolves game-theoretically as all agents communicate with neighbors and revise their models towards an equilibrium. Our focus is on the sample complexity needed to ensure that the opinions converge to an equilibrium such that the final model of every agent has low generalization error.
  Our paper has two main technical results. First, we present a novel polynomial time optimization framework to quantify the total sample complexity for arbitrary networks, when the underlying learning problem is (generalized) linear regression. Second, we leverage this optimization to study the network gain which measures the improvement of sample complexity when learning over a network compared to that in isolation. Towards this end, we derive network gain bounds for various network classes including cliques, star graphs, and random regular graphs. Additionally, our framework provides a method to study sample distribution within the network, suggesting that it is sufficient to allocate samples inversely to the degree. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world networks strongly support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of persuasiveness, cautiousness and prior beliefs in (mis)information sharing on online social networks using Drift Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misleading newsletters can shape individuals' perceptions, and pose a threat to societies; as we witnessed by lowering the severity of follow-up stay-at-home orders and burdening a significant challenge to the fight against COVID-19. In this research, we study (mis)information spreading, reanalyzing behavioral data on online sharing, and analyzing decision-making mechanisms using the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM). We find that subjects display an increased instinctive inclination towards sharing misleading news, but rational thinking significantly curbs this reaction, especially for more cautious and older individuals. On top of network structures with similar characteristics as X, Mastodon, and Facebook, we use an agent-based model to expand this individual knowledge to a large scale where individuals are exposed to (mis)information through friends and share (or not) content with probabilities driven by DDM. We found that the natural shape of these social online networks provides a fertile ground for any news to rapidly become viral. Yet we have found that, for the case of X, limiting the number of followers of the most connected users proves to be an appropriate and feasible containment strategy.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Accurate Self-Attention Attribution for Message Passing Neural Networks via the Computation Tree Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in various popular message passing neural networks (MPNNs), enabling the model to adaptively control the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. Such attention-based MPNNs (Att-GNNs) have also been used as a baseline for multiple studies on explainable AI (XAI) since attention has steadily been seen as natural model interpretations, while being a viewpoint that has already been popularized in other domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, undermining the potential of attention as interpretations for Att-GNNs. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of Att-GNNs and their potential explainability via attention. To this end, we propose GATT, edge attribution calculation method for self-attention MPNNs based on the computation tree, a rooted tree that reflects the computation process of the underlying model. Despite its simplicity, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GATT in three aspects of model explanation: faithfulness, explanation accuracy, and case studies by using both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. In all cases, the results demonstrate that GATT greatly improves edge attribution scores, especially compared to the previous naive approach.

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>
