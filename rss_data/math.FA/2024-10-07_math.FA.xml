      <title>Weighted estimates for a bilinear fractional integral operator and its commutator: A union condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main theme of this paper is to give sufficient conditions for the weighted boundedness of the bilinear fractional integral operator $\mathsf{BI}_\al$. The proposed condition involves the union of multilinear Muckenhoupt-type conditions. We have achieved new results in an unknown case and remarkably improved other known results by utilizing the hidden convolution nature inside the operator. We also study the effects of the general product commutators on the main operator and the weighted estimates for a related maximal operator that norm-wise dominates the main operator.</description>

      <title>L^1-regularity of strong ILB-Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If G is a Lie group modeled on a Fr\'echet space, let e be its neutral element and g be its Lie algebra. We show that every strong ILB-Lie group G is L^1-regular in the sense that each f in L^1([0,1],g) is the right logarithmic derivative of some absolutely continuous curve c in G with c(0)=e and the map from L^1([0,1],g) to C([0,1],G) taking f to c is smooth. More generally, the conclusion holds for a class of Fr\'echet-Lie groups considered by Hermas and Bedida. Examples are given. Notably, we obtain L^1-regularity for certain weighted diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Artinian and Noetherian properties in vector lattices and provide a concrete representation of these spaces. Furthermore, we describe for which Archimedean uniformly complete vector lattices every decreasing sequence of prime ideals is stationary (a property that we refer to as prime Artinian). We also completely characterize the prime ideals in vector lattices of continuous root functions and piecewise polynomials. This is a useful space for studying how having decreasing stationary sequences of prime ideals does not imply having increasing stationary sequences of prime ideals, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Elevating Precision in Inequalities for Numerical Radii and Operator Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a range of numerical radius inequalities. These discoveries will bring us to a recently validated numerical radius inequality and will present numerical radius inequalities that exhibit enhanced precision when compared to those recently established for particular cases. Additionally, we employ the generalized Aluthge transform for operators to deduce a set of inequalities pertaining to the numerical radius. Moreover, we set forth various upper and lower bounds for the numerical radius of $2\times 2$ operator matrices, refining and expanding upon the bounds determined previously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to address multiple aspects of the Fuglede question dealing (Fourier spectra vs geometry) with a variety of $L^2$ contexts where we make precise the interplay between the three sides of the question: (i) existence of orthogonal families of Fourier basis functions (and associated spectra) on the one hand, (ii) extensions of partial derivative operators, and (iii) geometry of the corresponding domains, stressing systems of translation-tiles. We emphasize an account of old and new developments since the original 1974-paper by Bent Fuglede where the co-authors and Steen Pedersen have contributed.</description>

      <title>Boundary Interpolation on Triangles via Neural Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study is to develop novel interpolation operators that interpolate the boundary values of a function defined on a triangle. This is accomplished by constructing New Generalized Boolean sum neural network operator $\mathcal{B}_{n_1, n_2, \xi }$ using a class of activation functions. Its interpolation properties are established and the estimates for the error of approximation corresponding to operator $\mathcal{B}_{n_1, n_2, \xi }$ is computed in terms of mixed modulus of continuity. The advantage of our method is that it does not require training the network. Instead, the number of hidden neurons adjusts the weights and bias. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficacy of these newly constructed operators. Further, with the help of MATLAB, comparative and graphical analysis is given to show the validity and efficiency of the results obtained for these operators.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Sobolev equations with the critical exponent and a potential in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the hyperbolic space, we study a semilinear equation with non-autonomous nonlinearity having a critical Sobolev exponent. The Poincar\'e-Sobolev equation on the hyperbolic space explored by Mancini and Sandeep [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci. 7 (2008)] resembles our equation. As seen from the profile decomposition of the energy functional associated with the problem, the concentration happens along two distinct profiles: localised Aubin-Talenti bubbles and hyperbolic bubbles. Standard variational arguments cannot obtain solutions because of nontrivial potential and concentration phenomena. As a result, a deformation-type argument based on the critical points at infinity of the associated variational problem has been carried out to obtain solution for $N&gt;6.$ Conformal change of metric is used for proofs, enabling us to convert the original equation into a singular equation in a ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and perform a fine blow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative metric geometry of quantum circle bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate quantum circle bundles from the point of view of compact quantum metric spaces. The raw input data is a circle action on a unital $C^*$-algebra together with a quantum metric of spectral geometric origin on the fixed point algebra. Under a few extra conditions on the spectral subspaces we show that the spectral geometric data on the base algebra can be lifted to the total algebra. Notably, the lifted spectral geometry is independent of the choice of frames and is permitted to interact with the total algebra via a twisted derivation. Under these conditions, it is explained how to assemble our data into a quantum metric on the total algebra in a way which unifies and generalizes a couple of results in the literature relating to crossed products by the integers and to quantum $SU(2)$. We apply our ideas to the higher Vaksman-Soibelman quantum spheres and endow them with quantum metrics arising from $q$-geometric data. In this context, the twist is enforced by the structure of the Drinfeld-Jimbo deformation arising from the Lie algebra of the special unitary group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an optimisation problem of Robin Laplacian eigenvalue with respect to an indefinite weight, which is formulated as a shape optimisation problem thanks to the known bang-bang distribution of the optimal weight function. The minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of the problem in a spherical shell of an arbitrary dimension is fully solved.</description>

      <title>Stable processes with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Hunt process that can be described as an isotropic $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process reflected from the complement of a bounded open Lipschitz set. In fact, we introduce a new analytic method for concatenating Markov processes. It is based on nonlocal Schr\"odinger perturbations of sub-Markovian transition kernels and the construction of two supermedian functions with different growth rates at infinity. We apply this framework to describe the return distribution and the stationary distribution of the process. To handle the strong Markov property at the reflection time, we introduce a novel ladder process, whose transition semigroup encodes not only the position of the process, but also the number of reflections.</description>

      <title>Continuity of extensions of Lipschitz maps and of monotone maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a subset of a Hilbert space. We prove that if $v\colon X\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is such that \begin{equation*}
  \Big\lVert v(x)-\sum_{i=1}^m t_iv(x_i)\Big\rVert\leq \Big\lVert x-\sum_{i=1}^m t_ix_i\Big\rVert \end{equation*} for all $x,x_1,\dotsc,x_m\in\mathbb{R}^m$ and all non-negative $t_1,\dotsc,t_m$ that add up to one, then for any $1$-Lipschitz $u\colon A\to\mathbb{R}^m$, with $A\subset X$, there exists a $1$-Lipschitz extension $\tilde{u}\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^m$ of $u$ such that the uniform distance on $X$ between $\tilde{u}$ and $v$ is the same as the uniform distance on $A$ between $u$ and $v$.
  Moreover, if either $m\in \{1,2,3\}$ or $X$ is convex, we prove the converse: we show that a map $v\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^m$ that allows for a $1$-Lipschitz, uniform distance preserving extension of any $1$-Lipschitz map on a subset of $X$ also satisfies the above set of inequalities.
  We also prove a similar continuity result concerning extensions of monotone maps.
  Our results hold true also for maps taking values in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Ideals in the dual of introverted subspaces of $\Psi$-pseudomeasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions satisfying the $\Delta_2$-condition. Let $A_\Phi(G)$ be the Orlicz analogue of the Fig\`{a}-Talamanca Herz algebra $A_p(G).$ The dual of the algebra $A_\Phi(G)$ is the space of $\Psi$-pseudomeasures, denoted by $PM_\Psi(G).$ For certain topologically introverted subspaces $\mathcal{A}$ of $PM_\Psi(G)$ and the Banach algebras $W_\Phi(G)$ or $B_\Phi(G),$ denoted by $\mathcal{B},$ we characterise the maximal regular left/right/two-sided ideals of the Banach algebras $\mathcal{A}^{'}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{''}$ considered with the Arens product. We further characterise the minimal left ideals of $\mathcal{A}^{'}$ and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of minimal ideals in the algebras $A_\Phi(G)$ and $\mathcal{B}.$</description>

      <title>Shift-cyclicity in analytic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we consider Banach spaces of analytic functions in one and several complex variables for which: (i) polynomials are dense, (ii) point-evaluations on the domain are bounded linear functionals, and (iii) the shift operator corresponding to each variable is a bounded linear map. We discuss the problem of determining the shift-cyclic functions in such a space, i.e., functions whose polynomial multiples form a dense subspace. This problem is known to be intimately connected to some deep problems in other areas of mathematics, such as the dilation completeness problem and even the Riemann hypothesis.
  What makes determining shift-cyclic functions so difficult is that often we need to employ techniques that are specific to the space in consideration. We therefore cover several different function spaces that have frequently appeared in the past such as the Hardy spaces, Dirichlet-type spaces, complete Pick spaces and Bergman spaces. We highlight the similarities and the differences between shift-cyclic functions among these spaces and list some important general properties that shift-cyclic functions in any given analytic function space must share. Throughout this discussion, we also motivate and provide a large list of open problems related to shift-cyclicity.</description>

      <title>Pre-measure spaces and pre-integration spaces in predicative Bishop-Cheng measure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bishop's measure theory (BMT) is an abstraction of the measure theory of a locally compact metric space $X$, and the use of an informal notion of a set-indexed family of complemented subsets is crucial to its predicative character. The more general Bishop-Cheng measure theory (BCMT) is a constructive version of the classical Daniell approach to measure and integration, and highly impredicative, as many of its fundamental notions, such as the integration space of $p$-integrable functions $L^p$, rely on quantification over proper classes (from the constructive point of view). In this paper we introduce the notions of a pre-measure and pre-integration space, a predicative variation of the Bishop-Cheng notion of a measure space and of an integration space, respectively. Working within Bishop Set Theory (BST), and using the theory of set-indexed families of complemented subsets and set-indexed families of real-valued partial functions within BST, we apply the implicit, predicative spirit of BMT to BCMT. As a first example, we present the pre-measure space of complemented detachable subsets of a set $X$ with the Dirac-measure, concentrated at a single point. Furthermore, we translate in our predicative framework the non-trivial, Bishop-Cheng construction of an integration space from a given measure space, showing that a pre-measure space induces the pre-integration space of simple functions associated to it. Finally, a predicative construction of the canonically integrable functions $L^1$, as the completion of an integration space, is included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ is an obstruction to weak amenability with Cowling--Haagerup constant $1$. More precisely, if $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is an infinite subgroup of $G$ such that the pair $(G,H)$ has relative Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$, then the weak Haagerup constant $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\mathrm{WH}}(G)$ is strictly greater than $1$. We apply this result to some semidirect products and lattices in higher rank algebraic groups.</description>
