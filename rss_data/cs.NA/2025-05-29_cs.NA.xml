      <title>Deep asymptotic expansion method for solving singularly perturbed time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has shown great potential in solving differential equations. However, it faces challenges when dealing with problems involving steep gradients. For singularly perturbed time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion equations, which exhibit internal transition layers with sharp gradients, we propose a deep asymptotic expansion (DAE) method that leverages deep learning to obtain explicit smooth approximate solutions. Inspired by asymptotic analysis, we first derive the governing equations for transition layers and then solve them using PINN. Numerical experiments show that DAE outperforms PINN, gPINN and PINN with adaptive sampling. We also show its robustness with respect to training point distributions, network architectures, and random seeds.</description>

      <title>Flux Globalization Based Well-Balanced Path-Conservative Central-Upwind Schemes for Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop second-order path-conservative central-upwind (PCCU) schemes for the hyperbolic shallow water linearized moment equations (HSWLME), which are an extension of standard depth-averaged models for free-surface flows. The proposed PCCU schemes are constructed via flux globalization strategies adapted to the nonconservative form via a path-conservative finite-volume method. The resulting scheme is well-balanced (WB) in the sense that it is capable of exactly preserving physically relevant steady states including moving-water ones. We validate the proposed scheme on several benchmarks, including smooth solutions, small perturbation of steady states, and dam-break scenarios. These results demonstrate that our flux globalization based WB PCCU schemes provide a reliable framework for computing solutions of shallow water moment models with nonlinear and nonconservative features.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Generator Matching for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</description>

      <title>Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin methods for scattering by periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method for the approximation of plane wave scattering by periodic diffraction gratings, modelled by the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The periodic obstacle may include penetrable and impenetrable regions. The TDG method requires the approximation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator on the periodic cell faces, and relies on plane wave discrete spaces. For polygonal meshes, all linear-system entries can be computed analytically. Using a Rellich identity, we prove a new explicit stability estimate for the Helmholtz solution, which is robust in the small material jump limit.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates and adaptivity for locally conservative methods. Inexpensive implementation and evaluation, polytopal meshes, iterative linearization and algebraic solvers, and applications to complex porous media flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A posteriori estimates give bounds on the error between the unknown solution of a partial differential equation and its numerical approximation. We present here the methodology based on H1-conforming potential and H(div)-conforming equilibrated flux reconstructions, where the error bounds are guaranteed and fully computable. We consider any lowest-order locally conservative method of the finite volume type and treat general polytopal meshes. We start by a pure diffusion problem and first address the discretization error. We then progressively pass to more complicated model problems, up to complex multiphase multicomponent flow in porous media, and also take into account the errors arising in iterative linearization of nonlinear problems and in algebraic resolution of systems of linear algebraic equations. We focus on the ease of implementation and evaluation of the estimates. In particular, the evaluation of our estimates is explicit and inexpensive, since it merely consists in some local matrix-vector multiplications. Here, on each mesh element, the matrices are either directly inherited from the given numerical method, or easily constructed from the element geometry, while the vectors are the algebraic unknowns of the flux and potential approximations on the given element. Our mtehodology leads to an easy-to-implement and fast-to-run adaptive algorithm with guaranteed overall precision, adaptive stopping criteria for nonlinear and linear solvers, and adaptive space and time mesh refinements and derefinements. Progressively along the theoretical exposition, numerical experiments on academic benchmarks as well as on real-life problems in two and three space dimensions illustrate the performance of the derived methodology. The presentation is largely self-standing, developing all the details and recalling all necessary basic notions.</description>

      <title>An additive two-level parallel variant of the DMRG algorithm with coarse-space correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a popular alternating minimization scheme for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in the tensor train format. Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange Monte Carlo methods for eigenfunction and related nonlinear problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a novel particle exchange Monte Carlo method. Whereas existing methods apply to eigenfunction problems where the eigenvalue is known (e.g., integrals with respect to a Gibbs measure, which can be interpreted as corresponding to eigenvalue zero), here the focus is on problems where the eigenvalue is not known a priori. To obtain an appropriate particle exchange rule we must consider a pair of processes, with one evolving forward in time and the other backward. Applications to eigenfunction problems corresponding to quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control are discussed.</description>

      <title>$S^{\top\!}S$-SVD and the Nearest Sketched Orthogonal Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketching techniques have gained popularity in numerical linear algebra to accelerate the solution of least squares problems. The so-called $\varepsilon$-subspace embedding property of a sketching matrix $S$ has been largely used to characterize the problem residual norm, since the procedure is no longer optimal in terms of the (classical) Frobenius or Euclidean norm. By building on available results on the SVD of the sketched matrix $SA$ derived by Gilbert, Park, and Wakin (Proc. of SPARS-2013), a novel decomposition of $A$, the $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD, is proposed, which is exact with high probability, and in which the left singular vectors are orthonormal with respect to a (semi-)norm defined by the sketching matrix $S$. The new decomposition is less expensive to compute, while preserving the singular values with probabilistic confidence. The $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD appears to be the right tool to analyze the quality of several sketching techniques in the literature, for which examples are reported. For instance, it is possible to simply bound the distance from (standard) orthogonality of sketched orthogonal matrices in state-of-the-art randomized QR algorithms. As an application, the classical problem of the nearest orthogonal matrix is generalized to the new $S^{\top\!} S$-orthogonality, and the $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD is used to solve it. Probabilistic bounds on the quality of the solution are also derived.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Free Diffusion Model -- A Perturbation Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling, typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann distributions and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient sampling for sparse Bayesian learning using hierarchical prior normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an approach for efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for challenging high-dimensional distributions in sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). The core innovation involves using hierarchical prior-normalizing transport maps (TMs), which are deterministic couplings that transform the sparsity-promoting SBL prior into a standard normal one. We analytically derive these prior-normalizing TMs by leveraging the product-like form of SBL priors and Knothe--Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangements. These transform the complex target posterior into a simpler reference distribution equipped with a standard normal prior that can be sampled more efficiently. Specifically, one can leverage the standard normal prior by using more efficient, structure-exploiting samplers. Our numerical experiments on various inverse problems -- including signal deblurring, inverting the non-linear inviscid Burgers equation, and recovering an impulse image -- demonstrate significant performance improvements for standard MCMC techniques.</description>

      <title>Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Physics-Infused Reduced-Order Modeling for Analysis of Multi-Layered Hypersonic Thermal Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM) framework for efficient and accurate prediction of transient thermal behavior in multi-layered hypersonic thermal protection systems (TPS). The PIROM architecture integrates a reduced-physics backbone, based on the lumped-capacitance model (LCM), with data-driven correction dynamics formulated via a coarse-graining approach rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. While the LCM captures the dominant heat transfer mechanisms, the correction terms compensate for residual dynamics arising from higher-order non-linear interactions and heterogeneities across material layers. The proposed PIROM is benchmarked against two non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs): Operator Inference (OpInf) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). The PIROM consistently achieves errors below 1% for a wide range of extrapolative settings involving time- and space-dependent boundary conditions and temperature-varying material property perturbations. In contrast, OpInf exhibits moderate degradation, and NODE suffers substantial loss in accuracy due to its lack of embedded physics. Despite higher training costs, PIROM delivers online evaluations of two orders of magnitude faster than the full-order model. These results demonstrate that PIROM effectively reconciles the trade-offs between accuracy, generalizability, and efficiency, providing a robust framework for thermal modeling of TPS under diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Defining Foundation Models for Computational Science: A Call for Clarity and Rigor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.</description>

      <title>Revisit CP Tensor Decomposition: Statistical Optimality and Fast Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a fundamental technique for analyzing high-dimensional tensor data. While the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm is widely used for computing CP decomposition due to its simplicity and empirical success, its theoretical foundation, particularly regarding statistical optimality and convergence behavior, remain underdeveloped, especially in noisy, non-orthogonal, and higher-rank settings.
  In this work, we revisit CP tensor decomposition from a statistical perspective and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of ALS under a signal-plus-noise model. We establish non-asymptotic, minimax-optimal error bounds for tensors of general order, dimensions, and rank, assuming suitable initialization. To enable such initialization, we propose Tucker-based Approximation with Simultaneous Diagonalization (TASD), a robust method that improves stability and accuracy in noisy regimes. Combined with ALS, TASD yields a statistically consistent estimator. We further analyze the convergence dynamics of ALS, identifying a two-phase pattern-initial quadratic convergence followed by linear refinement. We further show that in the rank-one setting, ALS with an appropriately chosen initialization attains optimal error within just one or two iterations.</description>

      <title>Neural Interpretable PDEs: Harmonizing Fourier Insights with Attention for Scalable and Interpretable Physics Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs -- a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO) in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space. As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable, and efficient physics learning.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce dro, an open-source Python library for distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for regression and classification problems. The library implements 14 DRO formulations and 9 backbone models, enabling 79 distinct DRO methods. Furthermore, dro is compatible with both scikit-learn and PyTorch. Through vectorization and optimization approximation techniques, dro reduces runtime by 10x to over 1000x compared to baseline implementations on large-scale datasets. Comprehensive documentation is available at https://python-dro.org.</description>

      <title>(U)NFV: Supervised and Unsupervised Neural Finite Volume Methods for Solving Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve, particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear \blue{time-dependent} partial differential equations (PDEs). In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Convergence Analysis of Inverse Potential Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the inverse problem of recovering a potential coefficient in an elliptic partial differential equation from the observations at deterministic sampling points in the domain subject to random noise. We employ a least squares formulation with an $H^1(\Omega)$ penalty on the potential in order to obtain a numerical reconstruction, and the Galerkin finite element method for the spatial discretization. Under mild regularity assumptions on the problem data, we provide a stochastic $L^2(\Omega)$ convergence analysis on the regularized solution and the finite element approximation in a high probability sense. The obtained error bounds depend explicitly on the regularization parameter $\gamma$, the number $n$ of observation points and the mesh size $h$. These estimates provide a useful guideline for choosing relevant algorithmic parameters. Furthermore, we develop a monotonically convergent adaptive algorithm for determining a suitable regularization parameter in the absence of \textit{a priori} knowledge. Numerical experiments are also provided to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Travelling wave solutions of an equation of Harry Dym type arising in the Black-Scholes framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes framework is crucial in pricing a vast number of financial instruments that permeate the complex dynamics of world markets. Associated with this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x, {\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\partial_x^2 -\partial_x)$ that carries a variable volatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$ and a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility model. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find a non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a time-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the Harry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave solutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and integrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent structures in financial-market volatility studies.</description>

      <title>Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in a chemotaxis model of bacteria and soil carbon dynamics as an example system where transient dynamics can give rise to pattern formation outside of Turing unstable regimes. We use a detailed analysis of the reactivity of the non-spatial and spatial dynamics, stability analyses, and numerical continuation to uncover detailed aspects of this system's pattern-forming potential. In addition to patterning in Turing unstable parameter regimes, reactivity of the spatial system can itself lead to a range of parameters where a spatially uniform state is asymptotically stable, but exhibits transient growth that can induce pattern formation. We show that this occurs in the bistable region of a subcritical Turing bifurcation. Intriguingly, such bistable regions appear in two spatial dimensions, but not in a one-dimensional domain, suggesting important interplays between geometry, transient growth, and the emergence of multistable patterns. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the bacterial soil organic carbon system, as well as for reaction-transport modelling more generally.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bias in Inverting Random Sampling Matrices with Application to Sub-sampled Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A substantial body of work in machine learning (ML) and randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) has exploited various sorts of random sketching methodologies, including random sampling and random projection, with much of the analysis using Johnson--Lindenstrauss and subspace embedding techniques. Recent studies have identified the issue of inversion bias -- the phenomenon that inverses of random sketches are not unbiased, despite the unbiasedness of the sketches themselves. This bias presents challenges for the use of random sketches in various ML pipelines, such as fast stochastic optimization, scalable statistical estimators, and distributed optimization. In the context of random projection, the inversion bias can be easily corrected for dense Gaussian projections (which are, however, too expensive for many applications). Recent work has shown how the inversion bias can be corrected for sparse sub-gaussian projections. In this paper, we show how the inversion bias can be corrected for random sampling methods, both uniform and non-uniform leverage-based, as well as for structured random projections, including those based on the Hadamard transform. Using these results, we establish problem-independent local convergence rates for sub-sampled Newton methods.</description>

      <title>Localization of tumor through a non-conventional numerical shape optimization technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for estimating the shape and location of an embedded tumor. The approach utilizes shape optimization techniques, applying the coupled complex boundary method. By rewriting the problem -- characterized by a measured temperature profile and corresponding flux (e.g., from infrared thermography) -- into a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition, the method simplifies the over-specified nature of the problem. The size and location of the tumor are identified by optimizing an objective function based on the imaginary part of the solution across the domain. Shape sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute the shape derivative of the functional. An iterative algorithm, which uses the Riesz representative of the gradient, is developed to numerically determine the geometry of the tumor via the finite element method. Additionally, we analyze the mesh sensitivity of the finite element solution of the associated state problem and derive a bound on its variation in terms of mesh deformation and its gradient. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We perform the numerical analysis of the regularised total variation flow using the gradient discretisation method (GDM). GDM is a unified convergence analysis framework that covers conforming and non-conforming numerical methods, for instance, conforming and non-conforming finite element, two-point flux approximation, etc.. In this paper, a fully discretised implicit scheme of the model is proposed, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the scheme is proved, the stability and consistency of the scheme are analysed, and error estimates are established.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores a full generalization of the classical corner-vector method for constructing weighted spherical designs, which we call the {\it generalized corner-vector method}. First we establish a uniform upper bound for the degree of designs obtained from the proposed method. Our proof is a hybrid argument that employs techniques in analysis and combinatorics, especially a famous result by Xu(1998) on the interrelation between spherical designs and simplical designs, and the cross-ratio comparison method for Hilbert identities introduced by Nozaki and Sawa(2013). We extensively study conditions for the existence of designs obtained from our method, and present many curious examples of degree $7$ through $13$, some of which are, to our surprise, characterized in terms of integral lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has become a central focus in scientific machine learning. Training neural networks for singularly perturbed problems is particularly challenging due to certain parameters in the PDEs that introduce near-singularities in the loss function. In this study, we overcome this challenge by introducing a novel method based on homotopy dynamics to effectively manipulate these parameters. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze the effects of these parameters on training difficulty in these singularly perturbed problems and establish the convergence of the proposed homotopy dynamics method. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence and improves the accuracy of these singularly perturbed problems. These findings present an efficient optimization strategy leveraging homotopy dynamics, offering a robust framework to extend the applicability of neural networks for solving singularly perturbed differential equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>Parallel GPU-Accelerated Randomized Construction of Approximate Cholesky Preconditioners</title>

Abstract: We introduce a parallel algorithm to construct a preconditioner for solving a large, sparse linear system where the coefficient matrix is a Laplacian matrix (a.k.a., graph Laplacian). Such a linear system arises from applications such as discretization of a partial differential equation, spectral graph partitioning, and learning problems on graphs. The preconditioner belongs to the family of incomplete factorizations and is purely algebraic. Unlike traditional incomplete factorizations, the new method employs randomization to determine whether or not to keep fill-ins, i.e., newly generated nonzero elements during Gaussian elimination. Since the sparsity pattern of the randomized factorization is unknown, computing such a factorization in parallel is extremely challenging, especially on many-core architectures such as GPUs. Our parallel algorithm dynamically computes the dependency among row/column indices of the Laplacian matrix to be factorized and processes the independent indices in parallel. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, our method requires little pre-processing time. We implemented the parallel algorithm for multi-core CPUs and GPUs, and we compare their performance to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a benchmark of eight optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the tVHA, evaluating performance on $H_2$, $H_4$, and $LiH$ (in both full and active spaces) under noiseless and sampling noise conditions. Sampling noise fundamentally alters optimizer behavior, with gradient-based methods performing best in ideal conditions, while population-based algorithms, such as CMA-ES, show greater resilience under noise. Hartree-Fock initialization reduces the number of function evaluations by 27-60% and consistently yields higher final accuracy compared to random starting points. We identify a precision limit set by sampling noise, with diminishing returns beyond approximately 1000 shots.</description>
