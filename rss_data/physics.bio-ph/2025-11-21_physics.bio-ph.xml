      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation - bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Contact cluster modeling of allosteric communication in PDZ domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the intriguing phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins, plays a central role in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction. While it is commonly attributed to conformational rearrangements, the underlying dynamical mechanisms remain poorly understood. The contact cluster model of allostery [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\sim 1\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $\beta$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation</title>

Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers arranged into the protofilaments of cytoskeletal microtubules. In the physical model proposed by the authors, the microtubule interiors are treated as high-Q quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavities that can support decoherence-resistant entangled states under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ sec. We identify strong electric dipole interactions between tubulin dimers and ordered water dipole quanta within the microtuble interior as the mechanism responsible for the extended coherence times. Classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models describing solitonic excitations are reinterpreted as emergent quantum-coherent-or possibly pointer-states, arising from incomplete collapse of dipole-aligned quantum states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer along microtubule filaments. We discuss logic-gate-like behavior facilitated by microtubule-associated proteins, and outline how such structures may enable scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage realized as a quDit encoded in the tubulin dipole state. We further describe a process akin to decision making that emerges following an external stimulus, whereby optimal, energy-loss-free signal and information transport pathways are selected across the microtubular network. Finally, we propose experimental approaches-including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes-to validate the use of biomatter as a substrate for scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Division Strategies Determine Growth and Viability of Growing-Dividing Autocatalytic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric framework to study the growth-division dynamics of cells and protocells, and demonstrate that self-reproduction emerges only when a system's growth dynamics and division strategy are mutually compatible. Using several commonly used models (the linear Hinshelwood cycle and non-linear coarse-grained models of protocells and bacteria), we show that, depending on the chosen division mechanism, the same chemical system can exhibit either (i) balanced exponential growth, (ii) balanced nonexponential growth, or (iii) system death (where the system either diverges to infinity or collapses to zero over successive generations). In particular, we show that cellular trajectories in an N-dimensional phase space (where N is the number of distinct chemical species) shuttle between two N-1 dimensional surfaces - a division surface and a birth surface - and that the relationship between these surfaces and the growth trajectories determine something as fundamental as cellular homeostasis and self-reproduction. Geometrically visualizing bacterial growth and division uncovers, for the first time, the type of division processes that sustain or destroy cellular homeostasis in autocatalytic chemical systems, thereby offering strategies to stabilize or destabilize growing-dividing systems. This reveals that, in addition to autocatalysis of growth, division mechanisms are not passive bystanders but active determinants of a growing-dividing system's long-term fate. Our work thus provides a framework for further exploration of growing dividing systems that will aid in the design of self-reproducing synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>
