      <title>Talent hat, cross-border mobility, and career development in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the influence of cross-border recruitment program in China, which confers scientists with a 'talent hat' including a startup package comprising significant bonuses, pay, and funding, on their future performance and career development. By curating a unique dataset from China's 10-year talent recruitment program, we employed multiple matching designs to quantify the effects of the cross-border recruitment with 'talent hat' on early career STEM scholars. Our findings indicate that the cross-border talents perform better than their comparable contenders who move without talent hats and those who do not move, given equivalent scientific performance before relocation. Moreover, we observed that scholars in experimental fields derive greater benefits from the talent program than those in non-experimental fields. Finally, we investigated how the changes in scientific environment of scientists affect their future performance. We found that talents who reassembled their collaboration network with new collaborators in new institutions after job replacement experienced significant improvements in their academic performance. However, shifting research directions entails risks, which results in a subsequent decrease of future productivity and citation impact following the relocation. This study has significant implications for young scientists, research institutions, and governments concerning cultivating cross-border talents.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Dynamics of COVID-19 Lockdown Success: Insights from Regional Data and Public Health Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus had a significant effect on social, economic, and health systems globally. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread worldwide resulting in severe disease, death, and social interference. Countries implemented lockdowns in various regions to limit the spread of the virus. Some of them were successful and some failed. Here, several factors played a vital role in their success. But mostly these factors and their correlations remained unidentified. In this paper, we unlocked those factors that contributed to the success of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the correlations among them. Moreover, this paper proposes several strategies to control any pandemic situation in the future. Here, it explores the relationships among variables, such as population density, number of infected, death, recovered patients, and the success or failure of the lockdown in different regions of the world. The findings suggest a strong correlation among these factors and indicate that the spread of similar kinds of viruses can be reduced in the future by implementing several safety measures.</description>

      <title>Time to Cite: Modeling Citation Networks using the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of scientific research, i.e., the science of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order to address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance science, how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be quantified and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \textsc{\modelabbrev} model characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact assessments.</description>

      <title>ARED: Argentina Real Estate Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Argentinian real estate market presents a unique case study characterized by its unstable and rapidly shifting macroeconomic circumstances over the past decades. Despite the existence of a few datasets for price prediction, there is a lack of mixed modality datasets specifically focused on Argentina. In this paper, the first edition of ARED is introduced. A comprehensive real estate price prediction dataset series, designed for the Argentinian market. This edition contains information solely for Jan-Feb 2024. It was found that despite the short time range captured by this zeroth edition (44 days), time dependent phenomena has been occurring mostly on a market level (market as a whole). Nevertheless future editions of this dataset, will most likely contain historical data. Each listing in ARED comprises descriptive features, and variable-length sets of images.</description>
