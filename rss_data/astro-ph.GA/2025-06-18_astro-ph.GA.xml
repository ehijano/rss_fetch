      <title>Accuracy of analytic potentials for orbits of satellites around a Milky Way-like galaxy: comparison with $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the orbits of satellites, a galaxy could be modelled either by means of a static gravitational potential, or by live $N$-body particles. Analytic potentials allow for fast calculations, but are idealized and non-responsive. On the other hand, $N$-body simulations are more realistic, but demand higher computational cost. Our goal is to characterize the regimes in which analytic potentials provide a sufficient approximation, and those where $N$-bodies are necessary. We perform two sets of simulations using both Gala and Gadget, in order to closely compare the orbital evolution of satellites around a Milky Way-like galaxy. Focusing on the periods when the satellite has not yet been severely disrupted by tidal forces, we find that the orbits of satellites up to $10^{8} {\rm M_{\odot}}$ can be reliably computed with analytic potentials to within 5% error, if they are circular or moderately eccentric. If the satellite is as massive as $10^{9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$, errors of 9% are to be expected. However, if the orbital radius is smaller than 30 kpc, the results may not be relied upon with the same accuracy beyond 1--2 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Leo I: the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the highest dark-matter density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are known for being strongly dominated by dark matter (DM), which makes them convenient targets for investigating the DM nature and distribution. Recently, renewed interest in the dSph Leo I has resulted from claims suggesting the presence of a central supermassive black hole (BH), with mass estimates that challenge the typical expectations for dSphs, which are generally thought to host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). However, Pascale et al. 2024 presented new upper limits on the BH mass, which are consistent with the range for IMBHs, solving the concerns raised in previous studies. Building on the analysis of Pascale et al. 2024, we examine the DM properties of Leo I inferred from the dynamical models of that paper. Our results indicate that Leo I is the galaxy with the highest DM density among the classical dSphs, with a central DM density (measured at a distance of $150$ pc from the galaxy centre) $\rho_{150}=35.5_{-4.7}^{+3.8}\times10^7\,M_\odot\,$pc$^{-3}$. The DM density profile has logarithmic slope $\gamma_{150}=-0.89_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$ at $150$ pc, in line with literature values. At smaller distances the DM distribution flattens into a core, with a core radius of $r_c=72^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. Combined with the small pericentric distance of Leo I's orbit in the Milky Way, the new estimate of $\rho_{150}$ makes Leo I decisive in the study of the anticorrelation between pericentre and central DM density, and suggests that the anticorrelation could be significantly steeper and more pronounced than previously estimated. Despite its DM dominance, Leo I does not emerge as the most favorable target for indirect DM detection: the inferred DM decay $D$ and annihilation $J$ factors, $\log D(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV cm$^{-2}$] = $17.94_{-0.25}^{+0.17}$ and $\log J(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV$^2$ cm$^{-5}$]= $18.13_{-0.18}^{+0.17}$ are consistent with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Interstellar dust production, destruction and effects of dust depletion in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its small mass fraction typically observed in the interstellar medium, dust plays a significant role as a key component of galaxies, affecting a wide range of properties. This review focuses specifically on how dust grains influence interstellar chemical abundances and on the processes that regulate the evolution of the galactic dust budget. I describe the main physical processes regulating dust evolution, including production by stars and other sources, destruction in supernova shocks and interstellar growth and how they are included in galactic chemical evolution models. I discuss the main effects of interstellar dust on the abundances measured in various high-redshift systems that include Damped Lyman alpha absorbers detected along the lines of sight of distant quasars and in the absorption spectra of Gamma Ray Burst afterglows. I discuss the measure of the dust mass in galaxies and review its global budget, evaluated through the study of the evolution of the comoving dust mass density, for which I present an up-to-date compilation of data chosen from the literature. Interstellar dust growth plays a critical role in regulating the dust budget, for which I present a list of evidence both in favour of it and against. The dust budget at high redshift is one aspect that requires attention to drive significant progress in the future, along with the investigation of the properties of dust in local, low-metallicity systems. Our poor theoretical knowledge of basic aspects related to dust evolution evidences the need for a new high-sensitivity space telescope operating in the far-infrared regime, still awaited by the community since the demise of Herschel.</description>

      <title>Overmassive black holes in the early Universe can be explained by gas-rich, dark matter-dominated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed the apparent evolution of the black hole (BH)-stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\rm{\ast}$) relation in the early Universe, while remaining consistent the BH-dynamical mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$) relation. We predict BH masses for $z&gt;3$ galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM simulations by assuming the $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation is fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the JWST-observed $M_\mathrm{BH}$ distribution, including overmassive BHs relative to the local $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{\ast}$ relation. We find that $M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{\ast}$ declines with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$, evolving from $\sim$0.1 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to $\sim$0.01 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This trend reflects the dark matter ($f_\mathrm{DM}$) and gas fractions ($f_\mathrm{gas}$), which decrease with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$ but show little redshift evolution down to $z=3$, resulting in small $M_\mathrm{\ast}/M_\mathrm{dyn}$ ratios and thus overmassive BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use $\texttt{Prospector}$-derived stellar masses and star-formation rates to infer $f_\mathrm{gas}$ across 48,022 galaxies in JADES at $3&lt;z&lt;9$, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive, rapidly growing BHs may strongly influence the earliest stages of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Ultraluminous Ly-alpha Luminosity Functions at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 from HEROES: Evidence for Ionized Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 based on a large 209 source sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates identified in Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam narrowband imaging and confirmed with Keck II/DEIMOS spectroscopy over a multi-year observing campaign. After applying photometric and spectroscopic cuts to produce homogeneous samples, we use the resulting samples of 49 z = 5.7 and 56 z = 6.6 LAEs to compute spectroscopic LAE LFs at each redshift. We correct our LFs for incompleteness using a source-injection simulation. We find excellent agreement with current spectroscopic and photometric LAE LFs from the literature. We look for evolution over the redshift range z = 5.7-6.6. We find a strong convergence of the LFs at L(Ly$\alpha$) &gt; $10^{43.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This convergence (noted in previous literature) provides strong evidence that the most luminous LAEs at z = 6.6 form ionized bubbles around themselves, allowing for greater Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the neutral intergalactic medium, which is measured as an increase in the bright end of the z = 6.6 LF over the expected evolution in the LF based on the faint end. We infer that ultraluminous LAEs may play a significant role in reionization.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star and Binary Neutron Star Mergers from Population III and II stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.</description>

      <title>Clumpiness of galaxies revealed in the near-infrared with COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clumps in the rest-frame UV emission of galaxies have been observed for decades. Since the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a large population is detected in the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR), raising questions about their formation mechanism. We investigate the presence and properties of NIR over-densities (hereafter substructures) in star-forming and quiescent galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 to understand their link to the evolution of their host galaxy. We identify substructures in JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W residual images at a rest-frame wavelength of 1 um.
  The fraction of galaxies with substructures with M* &gt; 10^9 Msun has been steadily decreasing with cosmic time from 40% at z = 4 to 10% at z = 1. Clumps, the main small substructures in the rest-frame NIR, are the most common type and are much fainter (2% of the flux) than similar UV clumps in the literature. Nearly all galaxies at the high-mass end of the main sequence (MS), starburst, and green valley regions have substructures. However, we do not find substructures in low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence. Although massive galaxies on the MS and in the green valley have a 40% probability of hosting multiple clumps, the majority of clumpy galaxies host only a single clump.
  The fraction of clumpy galaxies in the rest-frame NIR is determined by the stellar mass and SFR of the host galaxies. Its evolution with redshift is due to galaxies moving towards lower SFRs at z &lt; 2 and the build-up of low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence. Based on their spatial distribution in edge-on galaxies, we infer that most of substructures are produced in-situ via disk fragmentation. Galaxy mergers may still play an important role at high stellar masses, especially at low SFR.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ram Pressure from Tidal Interactions: the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: In dense environments, disk galaxies can be subjected to tidal interactions with other galaxies and/or ram pressure stripping. Some morphological features are clearly associated with one or the other interaction (e.g. tidal bridges vs long one-sided linear gas tails). But, under certain circumstances, both mechanisms can result in morphological features that could be confused, such as lopsided or asymmetric disks and unwinding spiral arms.
  Aims: Our aim is to develop new measures for application to asymmetric galaxies of this type that distinguish gravitational-only tidal interactions from ram pressure stripping, and that can be applied directly to simulations, and potentially to observations.
  Methods: We define a new measure for galaxies called the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure. This measure is sensitive to differences in the size and shape of a younger stellar population (&lt;200 Myr) compared to that of an intermediate age stellar population (200-400 Myr). We use numerical simulations of galaxies undergoing gravitational-only tidal interactions and/or undergoing ram pressure stripping to test the measure.
  Results: Because ram pressure tends to directly alter the gas distribution, the younger stellar population (which best traces out the gas distribution) tends to change shape and morphology with respect to the intermediate age population. The SSD measure is sensitive to this change, and we find it can effectively distinguish between ram pressure and gravitational-only tidal encounters. In fact, we find it is even more effective when a combination of a tidal interaction and ram pressure has occurred together, as may arise in dense environments. As tidal interactions tend to enhance the spiral structure in disk galaxies, the effectiveness of the SSD measure is further enhanced when combined with a measure of the strength of the spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Predicting the resolved CO emission of $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Resolved observations of the CO emission from $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies are becoming increasingly common, with new high-resolution surveys on the horizon. We aim to inform the interpretation of this resolved CO emission by creating synthetic observations and testing to what extent routinely observed CO transitions can be used to trace H$_2$ across galaxy disks. To this end, we extract $z=1-3$ massive star-forming galaxies (on and above the main sequence) from the SIMBA cosmological simulation and predict their spatially resolved CO(1$-$0)-to-CO(5$-$4) emission using the $\texttt{SLICK}$ pipeline, which combines sub-resolution modeling of the cloud population with the DESPOTIC spectral line calculation code. We find that the CO(1$-$0)-to-H$_2$ ratio ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) varies significantly within these galaxy disks$-$from values of $\sim1-5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ in the central 1-3 kpc of the most massive galaxies to $&gt;100$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ at $\sim$ 15 kpc. Thus, the use of a single $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ to derive the H$_2$ surface density leads to severe underestimates of the H$_2$ contribution in its outskirts. As expected, higher-$J$ CO transitions trace molecular gas in the centers at higher densities, whereas CO(1$-$0) better traces the more diffuse, extended molecular gas. We see significant variations in the CO excitation, with CO(3$-$2)/CO(1$-$0) line luminosity ratios of the most massive galaxies at $z\sim2$ declining from $\sim$ 0.9 in the galaxy centers to $\sim$ 0.1 in the outskirts. On average, line ratios increase substantially toward higher redshifts and lower galaxy stellar masses. We predict that tracing molecular gas with CO beyond 3-5 kpc of cosmic noon galaxies will be challenging with current facilities due to the drastic increase in $\alpha_{\rm CO}$.</description>

      <title>Extreme AGN feedback in the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($&lt;$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.</description>

      <title>Euclid: The potential of slitless infrared spectroscopy: A z=5.4 quasar and new ultracool dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of Euclid's slitless spectroscopy to discover high-redshift (z&gt;5) quasars and their main photometric contaminant, ultracool dwarfs. Sensitive infrared spectroscopy from space is able to efficiently identify both populations, as demonstrated by Euclid Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer Red Grism (NISP RGE) spectra of the newly discovered z=5.404 quasar EUCL J181530.01+652054.0, as well as several ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Field North and the Euclid Early Release Observation field Abell 2764. The ultracool dwarfs were identified by cross-correlating their spectra with templates. The quasar was identified by its strong and broad CIII] and MgII emission lines in the NISP RGE 1206-1892 nm spectrum, and confirmed through optical spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope. The NISP Blue Grism (NISP BGE) 926-1366 nm spectrum confirms CIV and CIII] emission. NISP RGE can find bright quasars at z~5.5 and z&gt;7, redshift ranges that are challenging for photometric selection due to contamination from ultracool dwarfs. EUCL J181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected at 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 3e12 Lsun and is powered by a 3.4e9 Msun black hole. The discovery of this bright quasar is noteworthy as fewer than one such object was expected in the ~20 deg2 surveyed. This finding highlights the potential and effectiveness of NISP spectroscopy in identifying rare, luminous high-redshift quasars, previewing the census of these sources that Euclid's slitless spectroscopy will deliver over about 14,000 deg2 of the sky.</description>

      <title>Multiple machine-learning as a powerful tool for the star clusters analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a multiple machine learning method (MMLM) aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness in the analysis of star clusters. The MMLM performance is evaluated by applying it to the reanalysis of the old binary cluster candidate - NGC 1605a and NGC 1605b - found by Camargo (2021) (hereafter C21). The binary cluster candidate is analyzed by employing a set of well established machine learning algorithms applied to the Gaia-EDR3 data. Membership probabilities and open clusters (OCs) parameters are determined by using the clustering algorithms pyUPMASK, ASteCA, Kmeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN. In addition, a KNN smoothing algorithm is implemented to enhances the visualization of features like overdensities in the 5D space and intrinsic stellar sequences on the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The method validates the clusters' parameters previously derived, however, suggests that their probable members-stars are distributed over a wider overlapping area. Finally, a combination of the elbow method, t-SNE, kmeans, and GMM algorithms group the normalized data into 6 clusters, following C21. In short, these results confirm NGC1605a and NGC1605b as genuine OCs and reinforce the previous suggestion that they form an old binary cluster in an advanced stage of merging after a tidal capture during a close encounter. Thus, MMLM has proven to be a powerful tool that helps to obtain more accurate and reliable clusters parameters and its application in future studies may contribute to a better characterization of the Galaxy's star cluster system.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of the mean magnetic field in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the spatial variations of the regular (mean) magnetic field of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), we use Fourier analysis in azimuthal angle along four rings in the galaxy's plane. Earlier analyses indicated that the axisymmetric magnetic field (azimuthal Fourier mode $m=0$) is sufficient to fit the observed polarization angles in a wide range of galactocentric distances. We apply a Bayesian inference approach to new, more sensitive radio continuum data at $\lambda \lambda3.59$, $6.18$, and $11.33$ cm and the earlier data at $\lambda 20.46$ cm to reveal sub-dominant contributions from the modes $m=1$, 2, and 3 along with a dominant axisymmetric mode. Magnetic lines of the axisymmetric mode are close to trailing logarithmic spirals which are significantly more open than the spiral arms detectable in the interstellar dust and neutral hydrogen. The form of the $m=0$ mode is consistent with galactic dynamo theory. Both the amplitudes and the pitch angles of the higher azimuthal modes ($m&gt;1$) vary irregularly with $r$ reflecting local variations in the magnetic field structure. The maximum strength of the mean magnetic field of $1.8\text{--}2.7\mu$G (for the axisymmetric part of the field) occurs at $10\text{--}14$ kpc but we find that its strength varies strongly along the azimuth; this variation gives rise to the $m=1$ mode. We suggest a procedure of Bayesian inference which is independent of the specific nature of the depolarization and applies when the magneto-ionic layer observable in polarized emission is not symmetric along the line of sight because emission from its far side is completely depolarized.</description>

      <title>The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Way's high redshift progenitors today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.</description>

      <title>JWST Reveals a Likely Jellyfish Galaxy at z=1.156</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of COSMOS2020-635829 as a likely jellyfish galaxy undergoing to ram pressure stripping in a (proto)cluster at $z &gt; 1$. High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south. We show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of COSMOS2020-635829. Likely representing the highest-redshift discovery of a ram pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by extremely young stellar populations ($\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Myr}$), have stellar masses of ${\sim}10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and star formation rates of $0.1\text{--}1\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. This work reinforces the notion that ram pressure stripping can perturb group and cluster galaxies at $z &gt; 1$ and likely contributes to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Structure and Magnetic Field of Bright-rimmed Cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension part.Since molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration due to the UV impact. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.</description>

      <title>NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations as surrogate models for Photodissociation Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>The ejection and detectability of high- and hyper-velocity stars by compact object binaries in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo $N$-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected $\sim$6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which $839_{-67}^{+70}$ have present-day velocities exceeding $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$. Using mock photometric observations, we find that $290_{-23}^{+28}$ ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only $1_{-1}^{+2}$ stars faster than $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.</description>

Statistical measurements of the large-scale DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$ at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24 pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model, ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$ nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ}, 4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$ and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to $400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797, and 6614 \r{A} in the Hot Stellar Spectra of the LAMOST LRS DR10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) are crucial tracers of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet their carriers remain poorly understood. While large-scale surveys have advanced DIB studies in cool stellar spectra, measurements in hot stellar spectra are still limited. Using 287 277 high signal-to-noise (S/N $&gt;$ 50) hot stellar spectra from the tenth data release of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectroscopic survey (LAMOST LRS DR10), we systematically measured the three prominent optical DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 \r{A}. We published three catalogs containing 285 103, 279 195, and 281 146 valid measurements for the DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 \r{A}, respectively. Among them, 112 479, 25 232, and 71 048 are high-quality samples after rigorous quality control. To our knowledge, these are the largest hot-star DIB datasets in the northern sky. The catalogs provide spectral metadata, added astrometeric information, DIB profiles, and quality metrics. Our methodology and open-source pipeline ensure reproducibility, while the scale and precision of the data support future statistical studies. We anticipate that these catalogs will highlight the LAMOST's role in advancing DIB research and deepening our understanding of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Cold gas in a post-starburst pair at z ~ 1.4: major mergers as a pathway to quenching in the HeavyMetal survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations at low redshift have revealed that some post-starburst galaxies retain significant molecular gas reservoirs despite low ongoing star formation rates, challenging theoretical predictions for galaxy quenching. To test whether this finding holds during the peak epoch of quenching, here we present ALMA CO(2-1) observations of five spectroscopically confirmed post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 1.4 from the HeavyMetal survey. While four galaxies are undetected in CO emission, we detect M_H2 ~ 10^9.7 Msun of molecular gas in one system. The detected system is a close pair of massive (M* = 10^(11.1-11.2) Msun) post-starburst galaxies with no clear tidal features, likely caught in the early stages of a major merger. These results suggest that mergers may be a key factor in retaining molecular gas while simultaneously suppressing star formation in quenched galaxies at high redshift, possibly by driving increased turbulence that decreases star formation efficiency. Unlike previous studies at z &lt; 1, we find no correlation between molecular gas mass and time since quenching. This may be explained by the fact that -- despite having similar UVJ colors -- all galaxies in our sample have post-burst ages older than typical gas-rich quenched systems at low redshift. Our results highlight the importance of major mergers in shaping the cold gas content of quiescent galaxies during the peak epoch of quenching.</description>

      <title>Protostellar disks in their natural habitat -- the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.</description>

      <title>ODIN: The LAE Ly{\alpha} Luminosity Function over Cosmic Time and Environmental Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity and relative ease of discovery make $2\lesssim z\lesssim 5$ Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) ideal tracers for cosmology. In addition, because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonance line, but frequently observed at large equivalent width, it is potentially a probe of galaxy evolution. The LAE Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) is an essential measurement for making progress on both of these aspects. Although several studies have computed the LAE LF, very few have delved into how the function varies with environment. The large area and depth of the One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey makes such measurements possible at the cosmic noon redshifts of z~2.4, ~3.1, and ~4.5. In this initial work, we present algorithms to rigorously compute the LAE LF and test our methods on the ~16,000 ODIN LAEs found in the extended COSMOS field. Using these limited samples, we find slight evidence that protocluster environments either suppress the numbers of very faint and very bright LAEs or enhance medium-bright LAEs in comparison to the field. We also find that the LF decreases in number density and evolves towards a steeper faint-end slope over cosmic time from z~4.5 to z~2.4.</description>

Abstract: The heating of a molecular cloud by photons emitted by a primary black hole (PBH) located inside the cloud is considered. For graphite and silicate dust particles, the dependence of dust temperature on the distance from PBH is derived, along with the emission spectrum of dust particles. The obtained spectrum is compared with the sensitivity of the Millimetron Space Observatory for various values of concentration and size of dust particles and different PBH masses.</description>

      <title>The Second and Third Data Releases from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the second and third data releases (DR2 and DR3, respectively) from the ongoing United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Hemisphere Survey (UHS). DR2 is primarily comprised of the $K$-band portion of the UHS survey, and was released to the public on June 1, 2023. DR3 mainly includes the $H$-band portion of the survey, with a public release scheduled for September 2025. The $H$- and $K$-band data releases complement the previous $J$-band data release (DR1) from 2018. The survey covers approximately 12,700 square degrees between declinations of 0 degrees and $+$60 degrees and achieves median 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivities of 19.0 mag and 18.0 mag (Vega) for $H$ and $K$, respectively. The data releases include images and source catalogs which include $\sim$581 million $H$-band detections and $\sim$461 million $K$-band detections. DR2 and DR3 also include merged catalogs, created by combining $J$- and $K$-band detections (DR2) and $J$-, $H$-, and $K$-band detections (DR3). The DR2 merged catalog has a total of $\sim$513 million sources, while the DR3 merged catalog contains $\sim$560 million sources.</description>

      <title>Sulphur abundances in star-forming regions from optical emission lines: A new approach based on photoionization models consistent with the direct method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of sulphur chemical abundances in the gas-phase of star-forming galaxies is explored in this work, using the emission lines produced in these regions in the optical part of the spectrum and by means of photoionization models. We adapted the code HII-CHI-mistry to account for these abundances by implementing additional grids of models that assume a variable sulphur-to-oxygen abundance ratio, beyond the commonly assumed solar ratio. The addition of these models, and their use in a new iteration of the code allows us to use sulphur lines to precisely estimate the sulphur abundance, even in the absence of auroral lines. This approach aligns with the results from the direct method, and no additional assumptions about the ionization correction factor are needed, as the models directly predict the total sulphur abundance. We applied this new methodology to a large sample of star-forming regions from the MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as a function of metallicity, making corrections for the significant contribution from diffuse ionized gas, which particularly affects the [SII] emission. Our results indicate no significant deviations from the solar S/O value in the range 8.0 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.7, where the bulk of the MaNGA sample stays, , but also with possible enhancements of sulphur production both at low and high metallicity regimes. The latter may be linked to the depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase due to its incorporation onto dust grains</description>

      <title>Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring individual detections. Through the wavelength-redshift relation, one can map the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the brightest features in galaxies' infrared spectra: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that $S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can be achieved at $z &lt; 0.5$ and $1 &lt; z &lt; 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively, for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture key dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertically hydrostatic energy balance equations with Rosseland mean opacities from free-free absorption, bound-free absorption, and electron scattering processes, combined with ionization fractions derived by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Inclusion of bound-free opacity introduces a noticeable flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. By comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that systems within $\sim10$ Mpc may show detectable IR excess from the CBD. Our results highlight the need for accurate opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic signatures of black hole mergers and support future integration of opacity tables with metallicity.</description>

Abstract: We have analyzed a sample of 2MIG isolated galaxies hosting AGNs (isolated AGNs) to assess whether their nuclear activity differs from that in a denser environment. The isolation criteria rule out interactions with other galaxies of similar size for at least $\sim$3 Gyr. We systemized the available Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and INTEGRAL X-ray data for isolated AGN at $z&lt;0.05$, determining their general X-ray properties and peculiarities, spectral models, SMBH masses, and possible parameter correlations. We investigated the best spectral models of 25 isolated AGNs, including 10 recently fitted in this work. The intrinsic luminosities $\log L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ do not exceed $\sim43$.
  Our results indicate that the isolation of galaxies in the nearby Universe does not significantly affect nuclear activity. This is confirmed by the diversity of accretion types and the absence of any advantage of one particular basic/compound spectral model. We note an interesting case discovered for the ESO499-041 spectrum, where the data-to-model ratio shows significant changes after 6.4 keV. These deviations from the continuum may indicate the presence of a relativistic Iron line in the Chandra spectrum of ESO 499-041 compared to the Swift spectrum. Most isolated AGNs contain SMBH with $M_{\mathrm{SMBH}} \leq 10^7,M_{\odot}$. For the first time, we found a linear correlation between $L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ and $\log M_{\mathrm{SMBH}}$ that is not observed in other AGN samples. This trend may be affected by the limited sample size and requires further confirmation with larger datasets. Finally, we identified UGC10120, NG6300, and CGCG243-024 as promising candidates for Milky Way analogues.</description>

      <title>VLBA astrometry of PSRs B0329+54 and B1133+16: Improved pulsar distances and comparison of global ionospheric models</title>

Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrometry is used to determine the three-dimensional position and proper motion of astronomical objects. A typical VLBI astrometric campaign generally includes around ten observations, making it challenging to characterise systematic uncertainties. Our study on two bright pulsars, B0329+54 and B1133+16, involves analysis of broadband Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data over $\sim30$ epochs (spanning approximately $3.5\, {\rm years}$). This extended dataset has significantly improved the precision of the astrometric estimates of these pulsars. Our broadband study suggests that, as expected, the primary contribution to systematic uncertainties in L-band VLBI astrometry originates from the ionosphere. We have also assessed the effectiveness of the modified TEC (total electron content) mapping function, which converts vertical TEC to slant TEC, in correcting ionospheric dispersive delays using global TEC maps. The parallax and proper motion obtained from the multiple data sets, calibrated using the traditional and the modified TEC mapping functions, are consistent. However, the reduced chi-square values from least-squares fitting and precision of the fitted astrometric parameters show no significant improvement, and hence, the effectiveness of the new TEC mapping function on astrometry is unclear. For B0329+54, the refined parallax estimate is $0.611^{+0.013}_{-0.013}\, {\rm mas}$, with best-fit proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha} = 16.960^{+0.011}_{-0.010}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in R.A. and and $\mu_{\delta} = -10.382^{+0.022}_{-0.022}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in Dec. For B1133+16, the new estimated parallax is $2.705^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\, {\rm mas}$, with proper motions of $\mu_{\alpha} = -73.777^{+0.008}_{-0.008}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ and $\mu_{\delta} = 366.573^{+0.019}_{-0.019}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of young isolated planetary mass objects in Taurus and Upper Scorpius</title>

Abstract: Free-floating planetary mass objects-worlds that roam interstellar space untethered to a parent star-challenge conventional notions of planetary formation and migration, but also of star and brown dwarf formation. We focus on the multiplicity among free-floating planets. By virtue of their low binding energy (compared to other objects formed in these environments), these low-mass substellar binaries represent a most sensitive probe of the mechanisms at play during the star formation process. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and its Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope and its ERIS adaptive optics facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the Upper Scorpius and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 5-33 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4 mas, or $\sim$18 au assuming a distance of 160pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3-6 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and a secondary mass between 2.6-5.2 M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the assumed age. This corresponds to an overall binary fraction of 1.8$^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$% among free-floating planetary mass objects over the separation range $\ge$7 au. Despite the limitations of small-number statistics and variations in spatial resolution and sensitivity, our results, combined with previous high-spatial-resolution surveys, suggest a notable difference in the multiplicity properties of objects below $\sim$25 M$_{\rm Jup}$ between Upper Sco and Taurus. In Taurus, five companions were identified among 78 observed objects (4.9$^{+2.8}_{-2.0}$%), whereas none were found among 97 objects in Upper Sco ($\le$1.2%).}</description>

      <title>Gas motion in the ICM of the Virgo cluster replica</title>

Abstract: Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF) from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections, comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$ within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion, which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent injection scale.</description>

      <title>FAST Pulsar Database: II. Scattering profiles of 122 Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The turbulent ionized interstellar medium diffracts radio waves and makes them propagate in multiple paths. The pulse-broadening observed at low frequencies results from the scattering effect of interstellar clouds of ionized gas. During the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey and other projects by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we detect the pulse-broadening for 122 pulsars in the radio frequency band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz, including 60 newly discovered pulsars in the GPPS survey and 62 previously known pulsars. We find that a more accurate dispersion measure can be obtained from aligning the front edge of the scattered subband pulses at the 1/4 or 1/2 peak level for most pulsars with one dominant component in the intrinsic profile, and the best DM values from aligning the intrinsic profile components from the model-fitting. From the pulse profiles at a few subbands we derive the pulse-broadening timescale and the scattering spectral index. These scattering parameters are measured for the first time for 93 pulsars. For 29 pulsars with previously detected scattering features, our measurements of the pulse-broadening timescale are consistent with results in the literature. We find that pulsars behind spiral arms show a stronger scattering effect due to greater density fluctuations in the arm regions. With a properly derived dispersion measure and careful calibration, we also present polarization profiles for 41 pulsars in three subbands of FAST observations.</description>

      <title>On the accretion luminosity of Class I protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The value of the accretion luminosity during the early phases of star formation is a crucial information which helps us understand how stars form, yet it is still very difficult to obtain. We develop a new methodology to measure accretion luminosity using mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and apply it to a limited sample of Class~I protostars in the Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions. We adopt the commonly used assumption that the properties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the disk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of three hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean intrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the probed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish correlations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure the extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars comparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive the Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations. We find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for the more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric temperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a sharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity. Our finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star formation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and more statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed comparison. Our results also suggest that by combining multiple infrared line ratios, it will be possible to derive a more detailed description of the dust extinction law in protostellar envelopes.</description>

Abstract: With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Currently employed techniques are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network such that inference is performed directly on the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 &lt; D ({\rm Mpc)} &lt; 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of applying silkscreen to large upcoming surveys, like LSST. While the current implementation performs simulations and training on a per-galaxy basis, future implementations will aim to provide a broadly-trained model that can facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. We focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Multiple Physical Processes on a Cluster Galaxy at z=0.3 Using JWST</title>

Abstract: We present a study of a previously identified candidate jellyfish galaxy in the Abell 2744 cluster, F0083, which showed faint signs of a tidal interaction in archival imaging. We used publicly available PSF-matched deep photometric data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to infer the spatially resolved star formation history of this galaxy. F0083 shows clear signs of ram-pressure stripping (RPS), with a recently enhanced star formation rate (SFR) orientated towards the south-west quadrant of the stellar disc. The stellar mass surface density is heavily asymmetric, with a variation of nearly 1 dex between the western spiral arm and the postulated tidal feature. This feature appears to contain a high proportion of older stars, ruling out RPS as the cause of this `unwinding'. We identified two potential interaction candidates, 28171 and 26055, with masses $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm{M}_{\odot})=8.56\pm0.06$ and $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm{M}_{\odot})=9.24\pm0.09$, respectively, and projected separations of 31 kpc and 46 kpc. The star formation history (SFH) of the tidal feature in F0083 indicates a steep change in SFR at lookback times $t_L\lesssim1\,$Gyr, consistent with a burst in the SFH of 26055. The most probable formation scenario of F0083 thus indicates a significant tidal interaction, followed by RPS as the combined system approaches pericentre passage. Our results demonstrate that by using photometric data we are able to distinguish between these consecutive processes, and represent the first observational analysis of the contributions of each process at this redshift.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Circumgalactic Medium around a Star-Forming Galaxy Driving a Galactic Outflow at $z\approx 0.8$</title>

Abstract: We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity. Taken together, these observations suggest evidence of a baryon cycle that is recycling the outflowing gas to form the next generation of stars.</description>

      <title>The impact of assembly history on the X-ray detectability of halos. From galaxy groups to galaxy clusters</title>

Abstract: Galaxy groups represent a significant fraction of the halo population, playing a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. However, their detection in X-rays remains challenging, raising questions about the physical mechanisms driving their detectability in current surveys. Using the Magneticum simulations, we construct a mock X-ray lightcone of the local Universe ($z&lt;0.2$) to investigate the selection function of galaxy groups and clusters. We find that AGN activity is a key driver of baryon depletion, but late-time mergers boost X-ray brightness by replenishing the gas reservoir in the halos, highlighting the interplay between feedback processes and the environment. Our analysis shows that X-ray bright groups experience sustained late-time mass accretion, maintaining higher gas fractions and fueling the central supermassive black holes (SMBH), further increasing the X-ray emissivity in the core. In contrast, X-ray faint groups form earlier and lose most of their gas over time, resembling fossil groups. Magneticum predicts strong anti-correlations between gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) and SMBH mass, stellar mass (both in the central galaxy and intracluster light), and group richness at fixed halo mass. We derive predictions on the hot gas fraction at fixed halos mass (e.g. a group of total mass $M_{500}=10^{13} M_{\odot}$ can have hot gas fractions in the range $f_\mathrm{gas}=0.02-0.06$ and a central SMBH with a median mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a scatter of $0.5$ dex) compatible with the most recent measurements of the baryonic fraction. These findings will aid the interpretation of future X-ray surveys, demonstrating the power of simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution and Spatial Distribution of Multiphase Gas associated with QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-phase gas surrounding QSOs traced by 33 absorption lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, C\,\textsc{iv}, Fe\,\textsc{ii}, Mg\,\textsc{ii}, etc.) in the stacked spectra of background sources, using the early data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our analysis reveals that the equivalent width (\( W \)) of metal absorption lines decreases with increasing redshift, following an overall trend described by $W \propto (1+z)^{-4.0\pm 2.7}$. Different species that trace multi-phases of QSO-associated gas exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns. Additionally, the \( W \) of these absorption lines decreases with distance ($D$) from QSOs, which can be effectively characterized by a two-halo model. Compared to the projected two point correlation function of galaxies at similar redshifts, low-ionization ions exhibit similar clustering scales, while high-ionization ions show a significantly more extended spatial distribution. We also find that $W_{\text{FeII}}/W_{\text{MgII}}$ increases towards lower redshifts, which can be attributed to evolving star formation histories and/or changes in initial mass function for galaxies. By leveraging multiple absorption tracers, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of diffuse, multiphase gas from the circumgalactic medium to cosmological scales, offering new insights into baryon cycles and the transport of metals throughout cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies ($&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Formation Pathways of Compact Elliptical Galaxies: Perspective of Internal Structures</title>

Abstract: We present a structural analysis of 138 compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) in the redshift range of $z &lt; 0.05$ using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 data. We perform single- and double-component S\'ersic model fitting to their SDSS $r$-band surface brightness profiles. By dividing cEs into those with [cE(w)] and without [cE(w/o)] a bright host galaxy, we find a significant structural dichotomy: the majority ($\sim$85\%) of cE(w)s exhibit single-component profiles, while a similar proportion ($\sim$85\%) of isolated cE(w/o)s display double-component profiles, characterized by a compact, inner component and a diffuse, disk-like outer component. These results suggest that host-associated cE(w)s primarily form through the tidal stripping of larger progenitors, resulting in a compact bulge-like core. In contrast, isolated cE(w/o)s appear to form intrinsically at early epochs, likely through gas-rich mergers, and retain disk-like outer structures. The S\'ersic index distribution of cE(w)s with single-component structure indicates progenitor types ranging from pseudo-bulge to classical bulge, supported by differences in stellar populations. A small fraction of cEs, including double-component cE(w)s and single-component cE(w/o)s, suggests complex evolutionary channels involving environmental capture or ejection. Our results emphasize that the structural characteristics of cEs, specifically the presence or absence of an extended outer envelope, serve as a crucial diagnostic tool to distinguish tidally stripped remnants from intrinsically formed low-mass cEs in isolation.</description>

      <title>Jet outbursts, non-thermal pressure and the AGN jet duty cycle</title>

Abstract: We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.</description>

      <title>Matching seismic masses for RR Lyrae-type and oscillating red horizontal-branch stars in M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters offer a powerful way to test the properties of stellar populations and the late stages of low-mass stellar evolution. In this paper we study oscillating giant stars and overtone RR Lyrae-type pulsators in the nearest globular cluster, M4, with the help of high-precision, continuous light curves collected by the Kepler space telescope in the K2 mission. We determine the frequency composition of five RRc stars and model their physical parameters from linear pulsation models. We are able, for the first time, to compare seismic masses of RR Lyrae stars directly to the masses of the very similar red horizontal branch stars in the same stellar population, independently determined from asteroseismic scaling relations. We find average seismic masses of $0.648\pm0.028\,M_\odot$ for RR Lyrae stars and $0.657\pm0.034\,M_\odot$ for red horizontal-branch stars. While the accuracy of our RR Lyrae masses still relies on the accuracy of evolutionary mass differences of neighboring horizontal branch subgroups, this result strongly indicates that RRc stars may indeed exhibit high-degree, $l = 8$ and 9 non-radial modes, and modeling these modes can provide realistic mass estimates. We compare the seismic masses of our red horizontal branch and RR Lyrae stars to evolutionary models and to theoretical mass relations and highlight the limitations of these relations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital alignment of highly inclined satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations $i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where $H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations ($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Link between Fast Radio Burst and Binary Neutron Star Origins with Spaceborne Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is an open question, with observations suggesting that at least some are associated with old stellar populations. It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by interactions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries before the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational waves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational wave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to test this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which hosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection capabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while missions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing detector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection probabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally containing a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can establish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance level of at least 2.81$\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\times10^6 - 7\times10^8$ / $5\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with optimistic/realistic assumptions. Next-generation detectors such as DECIGO offer enhanced capabilities and should easily detect these systems in M81 and beyond. Our work highlights the critical role of space-borne gravitational wave missions in unraveling FRB origins.</description>
