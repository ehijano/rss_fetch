      <title>Combination of traditional and parametric insurance: calibration method based on the optimization of a criterion adapted to heavy tail losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the question of providing insurance protection against heavy tail losses, where the expectation of the loss may not even be finite. The product we study is based on a combination of traditional insurance up to some limit, and a parametric (or index-based) cover for larger losses. This second part of the cover is computed from covariates available just after the claim, allowing to reduce the claim management costs via an instant compensation. To optimize the design of this second part of the product, we use a criterion which is adapted to extreme losses (that is distribution of the losses that are of Pareto type). We support the calibration procedure by theoretical results that show its convergence rate, and empirical results from a simulation study and a real data analysis on tornados in the US. We conclude our study by empirically demonstrating that the proposed hybrid contract outperforms a traditional capped indemnity contract.</description>

      <title>Index insurance under demand and solvency constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Index insurance is often proposed to reduce protection gaps, especially for emerging risks. Unlike traditional insurance, it bases compensation on a measurable index, enabling faster payouts and lower claim management costs. This approach benefits both policyholders, through quick payments, and insurers, through reduced costs and better risk control due to reliable data and robust statistical estimates. An important difference with the concept of Cat Bonds is that the feasibility of such coverage relies on the possibility of mutualization. Mutualization, in turn, is achieved only if a sufficiently high number of policyholders agree to subscribe. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a model for the demand for index insurance and to provide conditions under which the solvency of the portfolio is achieved. From these conditions, we deduce a product that combines index and traditional indemnity insurance in order to benefit from the best of both approaches.</description>
