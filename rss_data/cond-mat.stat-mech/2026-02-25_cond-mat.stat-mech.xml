      <title>Spectral Decimation of Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theory of spectral decimation for quantum many-body Hamiltonians and show that it provides a quantitative probe of emergent symmetries in statistically mixed spectra. Building on an analytical description of statistical mixtures, we derive an explicit expression for the size of a characteristic symmetry sector (CSS), defined as the largest subsequence of levels exhibiting non-Poissonian correlations. The CSS dimension is shown to be the size-biased average of the underlying symmetry sectors, establishing a direct link between spectral statistics and Hilbert-space structure. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic settings: Hilbert-space fragmentation and disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL). In fragmented systems, the CSS reproduces the mixture prediction and isolates correlated subsectors even when the full spectrum appears nearly Poissonian. In the disordered Heisenberg chain, spectral decimation reveals the gradual emergence of integrability through a shrinking CSS, whose statistics exhibit signatures consistent with local integrals of motion. We introduce a characteristic symmetry entropy (CSE) as a finite-size scaling observable and extract, within accessible system sizes, the crossover exponents. Our results establish spectral decimation as a controlled, unbiased and computationally inexpensive diagnostic of hidden structure in many-body spectra, capable of distinguishing between chaotic dynamics, statistical mixtures, and emergent integrability.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in active fluids reshape nucleation and capillary-wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nucleation in typical active and driven fluids often appears equilibrium-like, striking departures emerge when large-scale fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Here, we investigate nucleation in nonequilibrium hyperuniform fluids by projecting the full density-field dynamics onto relevant collective variables. We demonstrate that nucleation is governed by a nonequilibrium quasi-potential rather than the reversible work of formation. Surprisingly, because of the reduced hyperuniform fluctuations, the nucleation probability no longer separates into the usual surface and volume contributions. Furthermore, accounting for capillary waves reveals a clear breakdown of detailed balance driven by nonreciprocal dynamics. More broadly, our framework can be readily extended to identify nonequilibrium signatures in conventional active fluids.</description>

      <title>Mutual Linearity is a Generic Property of Steady-State Markov Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting how complex systems respond to external perturbations is a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Here we consider continuous-time Markov networks, which we subject to perturbations along a single edge. We find that in steady state the probabilities of any two states are linearly related to one another. We show that this mutual linearity of probabilities extends to a broad class of observables, including currents but also generic counting and state-dependent observables. Moreover, we derive an exact relation between the relative response of any state's probability and the ratio of two steady-state probabilities. Leveraging the Markov chain tree theorem, we further show that probabilities and the considered observables are constrained by the topological and kinetic properties of the network and provide analytical expressions in terms of spanning tree polynomials. Our results are general, holding for arbitrary rate parameterizations and extending far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems for a non-Gaussian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we numerically verify the Jarzynski equality and Crook fluctuation theorem for a Brownian particle diffusing in a heterogeneous thermal bath and hence having a non-Gaussian position distribution. We use the diffusing-diffusivity model to take the account of heterogeneity of the thermal bath where the mobility is considered as a fluctuating quantity. The Brownian particle is confined by a time-dependent harmonic potential. By changing the stiffness coefficient, we perform an isothermal process. We use the stochastic thermodynamics framework to calculate the work. We find that the Jarzynski equality and the Crook fluctuation theorem are convincingly satisfied for a non-Gaussion system. We also find that the work distribution is non-Gaussian for diffusing-diffusivity system even at a larger process time.</description>

      <title>Criticality Beyond Nonanalyticity: Intrinsic Microcanonical Signatures of Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are conventionally defined by nonanalyticities of thermodynamic potentials in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we show that the singularity is not the definition of criticality but its asymptotic outcome: criticality is already written in the microcanonical entropy derivatives at any finite size as intrinsic morphological structures -- inflection points and extrema. The singularity is then the endpoint of a sharpening process that evolves with increasing system size. Combining microcanonical inflection-point analysis (MIPA) with the Berlin-Kac spherical model -- for which the microcanonical density of states is known in closed form at every finite $N$ -- we systematically identify these structures in the energy profiles of entropy derivatives that encode the transition. An inflection point in the inverse temperature $\beta_N(\epsilon)=\partial_\epsilon S_N$ and a pronounced peak in its derivative $\gamma_N(\epsilon)=\partial^2_\epsilon S_N$ define a well-controlled pseudocritical trajectory whose controlled sharpening and drift culminate in the macroscopic cusp at the critical energy $\epsilon_c$ in the thermodynamic limit. This establishes an intrinsic, order-parameter-free notion of criticality that precedes its singular asymptotic representation.</description>

      <title>Breakdown and Restoration of Hydrodynamics in Dipole-conserving Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general hydrodynamic theory for active fluids, capable of describing living matter, that conserve center of mass or dipole moment. Imposition of dipole or center-of-mass conservation has been reported to yield peculiar behavior: breaking Galilean invariance in classical systems and potentially enabling exotic immobile excitations in quantum settings. In passive fluids, dipole conservation has been shown to cause a breakdown of linear hydrodynamics in all experimentally relevant dimensions. We show that introducing activity changes this picture: it can either restore or break linear hydrodynamics depending on spatial dimensions. Using our formulation, we predict universal dynamical scaling exponents for single-component active fluids in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions and find agreement with microscopic lattice-field simulations. Strikingly, for $d\geq 2$, activity revives linear hydrodynamics, while for $d&lt;2$ it leads to a breakdown; both cases flow to previously unexplored universality classes. Our results suggest that dipole-conserving active fluids are far more experimentally accessible than their passive counterparts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Barriers from Computational Complexity: Matrix-Product-State Approach to Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Construction of a Neural Network with Temperature-Dependent Recall Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model that recalls two different patterns depending on the temperature. To realize a change in recall pattern due to temperature change, we embed two patterns to different graphs: the first pattern into a fully connected graph and the second pattern into a sparse graph. Because a fully connected graph is more resistant to thermal fluctuations than a sparse graph, we can realize a change in recall pattern by tuning relative weights of the two patterns properly. We demonstrate by equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations that such a temperature-dependent change in recall patterns does occur in our model. Simulation results strongly indicate that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition when the change in recall patterns occurs. It is also demonstrated by annealing simulations that the system fails to recall the pattern embedded in the sparse graph at low temperatures if the free-energy barrier is too high to overcome within the given simulation timescale.</description>

      <title>Physics-based phenomenological characterization of cross-modal bias in multimodal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term 'algorithmic fairness' is used to evaluate whether AI models operate fairly in both comparative (where fairness is understood as formal equality, such as "treat like cases as like") and non-comparative (where unfairness arises from the model's inaccuracy, arbitrariness, or inscrutability) contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.</description>

      <title>Tipping points in complex ecological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years. We highlight the main findings, identify gaps in our knowledge, and outline a roadmap for further progress.</description>

      <title>The Jammed Phase of Infinitely Persistent Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extreme active matter system, which is essentially a dense assembly of athermal, soft and infinitely persistent active particles. Using extensive numerical simulations we obtain jammed configurations of this system in two dimensions and probe the stability of such structures under increasing active forcing magnitude. We show that the critical active forcing magnitude for the jammed phase to yield scales with virial pressure as $f_c\sim p^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1.17$, describing the yielding line. Using a Laplacian framework, we redistribute the active forces into a modified contact force network. By analysing the statistics of these redistributed forces, we obtain a very robust scaling law consistent with the passive limit, not just near the unjamming line, but in the entire jammed active phase. The probability distribution of the magnitude of the contact force deviates from the power-law form found in passive systems for values smaller than the active force. Moreover, within the jammed phase, the system displays elastic, plastic, and yielding events with increasing active forcing. This active plasticity appears abruptly and can not be captured by the continuous softening of the Hessian spectrum. However, we demonstrate that the Hessian still retains the ability to predict relaxation times. These results clarify how activity modifies force distributions and leads to deformation, plasticity and yielding in dense, jammed, infinitely persistent active matter.</description>

      <title>Probing frustrated spin systems with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effective interaction between two localized spin impurities embedded in a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Treating the impurity spins as classical moments coupled locally to the host, we combine second--order perturbation theory with large--scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to determine the impurity--impurity interaction as a function of separation, coupling strength, and magnetic frustration. In the weak--coupling regime, we show that the interaction is governed by the the static spin susceptibility of the host and exhibits oscillatory power--law decay in the gapless phase, modified by universal logarithmic corrections at the SU(2)--symmetric critical point. In the gapped dimerized phase, the interaction decays exponentially with distance. For intermediate and strong impurity--host coupling, we observe a crossover to a boundary--dominated regime characterized by pronounced parity effects associated with the length of the chain segment between impurities, signaling a breakdown of the simple RKKY--like description. Our results establish impurity--impurity interactions as a sensitive probe of frustrated quantum spin liquids and provide a controlled framework for distinguishing gapless and gapped phases through local perturbations.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Predictions of Derivative Thermodynamic Properties of a Confined Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with standard parametrization it fails to predict derivative properties. However, slight adjustment in parameters leads to quantitative predictions of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient at a selected temperature. Using the adjusted parameterization we performed the calculations of compressibility of argon confined in carbon slit pores of various sizes, and demonstrated that the compressibility of argon in confinement is lower than that in bulk and is pore size dependent. We confirmed the DFT predictions using the Monte Carlo molecular simulations. In addition to isothermal compressibility, we calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of confined argon. Our calculations showed that it behaves similar to compressibility -- it is always lower than the bulk value and gradually increases for smaller pore sizes. For several selected pore sizes we verified the DFT calculations by Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, our results suggest that the classical DFT can be utilized for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties of confined fluids, which are computationally challenging to predict using molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum transport in non-Markovian open Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build an exact framework to evaluate heat, energy, and particle transport between Gaussian reservoirs mediated by a quadratic quantum system. By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system's initial state. In the steady-state, weak-coupling limit, we recover results analogous to those of the well-known Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We conclude our discussion by demonstrating an application of the method to a prototypical fermionic system. Our results uncover a regime of transient negative heat conductance contingent upon the initial system preparation, providing a clear signature of non-trivial out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Residual Entropy of Glasses and the Third Law Expression</title>

Abstract: The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of materials becomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and other similar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third law. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by regarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many inconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to these inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law without any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature of entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only when thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are TCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for solids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On this basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of atoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be assigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by discrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations. Among various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at sufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration, which do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that region. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by expressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes at $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended space including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high temperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained through several debates on the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings are applicable to virtually any chaotic extended classical many-body system.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the natural bounds of entropy production for driven nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body systems reveals how the fundamentals of thermodynamics manifest in these regimes across a wide variety of systems. In this direction, we propose and study the dynamics of a thermal zero-player entropy game, the Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg), a self-driven system exhibiting characteristics of lattice gases, Ising models, and discrete games. We show that there is a universal bound on the entropy production rate, independent of temperature and lattice size. The thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible testbed for studying the fundamentals of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Improving the efficiency of quantum annealing with controlled diagonal catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the annealing time required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales inversely proportional to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy for improving the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains difficult. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate quadratic speedup of the exponential scaling exponent in time to solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics of the directed percolation with L\'evy-driven temporally quenched disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in absorbing phase transitions can disrupt the structure and symmetry of reaction-diffusion processes, offering a more accurate mapping to real physical systems. We developed a temporally quenched disorder method in the (1+1)-dimensional direct percolation (DP) model, where the increment of conditional probability is determined by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the L\'evy distribution. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations reveal that the model has a critical region governing the transition between absorbing and active states, and this region changes as the parameter $\beta$, which influences distribution properties. Guided by dynamic scaling laws, we observe that significant variations in the L\'evy distribution parameter $\beta$ lead to notable changes in the particle density decay exponent $\alpha$, total particle number exponent $\theta$, and spreading exponent $\tilde{z}$. The quenching mechanism we introduced has broad potential applications in various theoretical and experimental studies of absorbing phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Computing Large Deviations of First-Passage-Time Statistics in Open Quantum Systems: Two Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two methods for computing the large deviations of the first-passage-time statistics in general open quantum systems. The first method determines the region of convergence of the joint Laplace transform and the $z$-transform of the first-passage time distribution by solving an equation of poles with respect to the $z$-transform parameter. The scaled cumulant generating function is then obtained as the logarithm of the boundary values within this region. The theoretical basis lies in the facts that the dynamics of the open quantum systems can be unraveled into a piecewise deterministic process and there exists a tilted Liouville master equation in Hilbert space. The second method uses a simulation-based approach built on the wave function cloning algorithm. To validate both methods, we derive analytical expressions for the scaled cumulant generating functions in field-driven two-level and three-level systems. In addition, we present numerical results alongside cloning simulations for a field-driven system comprising two interacting two-level atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: We show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$ and a dynamical exponent $z=2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.</description>

      <title>The stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: microscopic derivation and finite-temperature phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic version of the one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNSE), which is derived from first principles, and thus possesses all the properties required by statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and the H-theorem. The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that recent numerical findings of universal scaling relations in systems of noisy, aligning self-propelled particles by K\"ursten [K\"ursten, arXiv:2402.18711v2 [cond-mat.soft] (2025)] can robustly be explained by perturbation theory and known results for the Mathieu equation with purely imaginary parameter. In particular, we highlight the significance of a cascade of exceptional points that leads to non-trivial fractional scaling exponents in the singular-perturbation limit of high activity. Crucially, these features are rooted in the Fokker-Planck operator corresponding to free self-propulsion. This can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition in the dynamics of noisy active matter. We also predict that these scaling relations depend on the symmetry of the alignment interactions and discuss the relevance of this structure in the free propagation for self-alignment and cohesion-type interactions.</description>

Abstract: All isometrically invariant Markov (strictly local) fields on binary assignments are induced by energy functions that can be represented as linear combinations of area, perimeter, and Euler characteristic. This class of model includes the Ising model, both ferro- and antiferro-magnetic, with and without a field, as well as the "triplet" Ising model We determine the low-temperature behavior for this class of model, and construct a phase diagram of that behavior. In particular, we identify regions with three geometric phases, regions with a single unique phase, and coexistence lines between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensitive detection of low-abundance molecular targets is widely assumed to require enzymatic amplification, such as PCR, to achieve low detection limits. In amplification-free platforms, sensitivity is traditionally constrained by equilibrium binding affinity. Here we show that multivalent linker entropy provides a distinct physical route to exponential sensitivity enhancement in purely equilibrium sensing architectures. Using a statistical-mechanical theory supported by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that redistributing a fixed total interaction strength over increasing linker valency exponentially lowers adsorption thresholds. This scaling emerges not from stronger energetic affinity, but from the rapid growth of combinatorial binding configurations, revealing entropy as an intrinsic amplification mechanism. Consequently, detection limits can be tuned independently of bond strength, enabling ultrasensitive responses without enzymatic replication. Our results establish a general physical design principle for engineering amplification-free detection systems capable of approaching PCR-level sensitivities through entropy-driven collective effects.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Field-Theoretic Framework via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and coding transitions of Haar-random quantum codes</title>

Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random $\textit{stabilizer}$ codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher $\textit{detection}$ threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless quantum matter stems from low-energy descriptions using conformal field theory. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the underlying quantum geometry by considering finite many-body systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that probe the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. The former is less sensitive to decoherence than the latter, so it can provide robust experimental signatures of our predictions. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the emergent effective description. This is supported both by numerical simulations of gapless lattice models, and by exact results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, probing the full dynamical parameter space.</description>

      <title>Additional quantum many-body scars of the spin-$1$ $XY$ model with Fock-space cages and commutant algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of dilute weakly charged granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law interactions under uniform shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and shear viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</description>
