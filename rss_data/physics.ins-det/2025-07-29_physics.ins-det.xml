      <title>Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the 157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched 157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 % increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %) and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Noise Characterization and Suppression in Low-Field MRI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where signal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency (RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for maximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, electromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient loading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate a practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing electromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the thermal noise limit.
  Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes diagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for cabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise measurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded and with a human subject present.
  Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a low-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their impact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal bound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the direct relationship between system noise and image quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate close to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions. The framework also provides actionable guidance for the integration of additional system components, such as gradient drivers and automatic tuning networks, without compromising SNR.</description>

      <title>Monolithic optoelectronic circuit design for on-chip terahertz applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a monolithic coplanar stripline platform for on-chip terahertz (THz) generation, transmission, and detection, addressing key challenges of mode purity, bandwidth, and referencing. Capacitive coupling of the photoconductive generator switch enforces pure odd-mode propagation, increases THz field strength, and extends the operational frequency range, achieving 0.05-1.4 THz. Our architecture enables fully monolithic fabrication with amorphous silicon switches, in situ field referencing, and galvanic isolation between generation and detection. Finite-element simulations and experiments confirm that suppressing parasitic modes improves signal integrity, providing a robust platform for high-fidelity THz spectroscopy, ultrafast electronics, and nanoscale quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Detection of twisted radiowaves with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the outer electron in an alkali atom in the presence of structured electromagnetic waves is described. The interaction of the alkali Rydberg atom with twisted radiowaves is considered. The two schemes for Rydberg-atom based detector of twisted radiowaves are proposed. According to the theoretical model for these detectors, they can record a source of twisted radiowaves with power down to several nW. The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</description>
