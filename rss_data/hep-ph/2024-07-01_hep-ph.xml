      <title>X-Ray Constraints on Dark Photon Tridents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons that are sufficiently light and/or weakly-interacting represent a compelling vision of dark matter. Dark photon decay into three photons, which we call the dark photon trident, can be the dominant channel when the dark photon mass falls below the electron pair threshold and can produce a significant flux of x-rays. We use 16 years of data from INTEGRAL/SPI to constrain sub-MeV dark photon decay, producing new worlds-best constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses between 61 keV and 1022 keV, and comment on the potential for future x-ray observatories to discover the trident decay process.</description>

      <title>Graviton- and Inflaton-mediated Dark Matter Production after Large Field Polynomial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial inflation is a simple cosmological scenario, which fits the cosmic microwave background data well. It provides testable predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index. In this work, we investigate the production of Dirac dark matter (DM) within the framework of large-field polynomial inflation. We study all relevant production channels including $i$) non-thermal production through inflaton decays and scatterings, and $ii$) thermal production from scattering of standard model particles mediated by inflatons and gravitons. In contrast to small-field polynomial inflation, where inflaton decay dominates DM production, we find that graviton-mediated processes can be dominant in the large-field scenario. In particular, graviton-mediated scatterings can account for the observed relic abundance even when DM is up to one order of magnitude heavier than the inflaton. For DM lighter than the inflaton, we demonstrate that the interplay between graviton- and inflaton-mediated production channels give rise to non-trivial relations between the DM mass and the reheating temperature required to account for the DM relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Bringing Peccei-Quinn Mechanism Down to Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conventionally assumed that the physics underlying the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism for addressing the strong CP problem is at very high energies, orders of magnitude above the weak scale. However, this may not be the case in general and the associated PQ boson $\phi$, besides the signature state, {\it i.e.} the ultralight axion $a$, may emerge well below the weak scale. We consider this possibility and examine some of the conditions for its viability. The example model proposed here may also provide the requisite Standard Model Higgs mass parameter, without invoking new scalars above the GeV scale. The corresponding parameter space can maintain {\it finite naturalness} against quantum corrections. This scenario, depending on choice of parameters, can potentially be constrained by flavor data. We point out that the current mild excess in $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$, reported by the Belle II experiment, could be explained in this setup as $B^+\to K^+ \phi$ and $B^+\to K^+ a$, with both $\phi$ and $a$ escaping the detector as missing energy. For a sufficiently heavy PQ boson, in the GeV regime, one can separate these two contributions, due to the difference in $K^+$ momenta. In this case, the axion may also affect lighter meson, {\it e.g.} kaon, decays while $\phi$ would not be a kinematically allowed final state.</description>

      <title>Nonleptonic $B$-meson decays to next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the partonic processes $b\to c \bar{u} d$ and $b\to c \bar{c} s$, which constitute the dominant decay channels in standard model predictions for $B$-meson lifetimes within the heavy quark expansion. We consider the contribution from the four-quark operators $O_1$ and $O_2$ in the $\Delta B =1$ effective Hamiltonian. The decay rates are obtained from the imaginary parts of four-loop propagator-type diagrams. We compute the corresponding master integrals using the ``expand and match'' approach which provides semi-analytic results for the physical charm and bottom quark masses. We show that the dependence of the decay rate on the renormalization scale is significantly reduced after including the next-to-next-to-leading order corrections. Furthermore, we compute next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa-suppressed decay channels $b \to u \bar c s$ and $b \to u \bar u d$.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium spectral function in the spinning black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we analyze the spectral function of charmonium and bottomonium in the spinning black hole background and examine how the angular momentum affects the dissociation of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. From the results, we find that the angular momentum decreases the peak height and expands the peak width of the spectral function which indicates it enhances the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the angular momentum has a stronger dissociation effect in the transverse orientation, revealing the directional influence of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Refined approaches in second leptogenesis for the baryon-lepton asymmetry discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent mass of the heavy neutrino can lead to the second leptogenesis occurring below the electroweak scale, potentially explaining the large discrepancy between baryon and lepton asymmetries. We investigate this scenario further, exploring the intricate interplay of the weak interaction processes within this framework. It includes notable shifts in the dominant decay channels of heavy neutrinos around the electroweak symmetry breaking, along with the resonance behavior of the scattering processes near the $W/Z$ mass. The $CP$ asymmetry can also vary over cosmic history due to the temperature-dependent mass, allowing the $B-L$ asymmetry generation to be amplified in the late epoch. These findings elucidate how such alterations in the dynamics of second leptogenesis contribute to addressing the observed discrepancies in baryon-lepton asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium production in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusive production of pseudoscalar heavy quarkoniua ($\eta_c,~\eta_b$ and $B_c$) via photon-photon fusion in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision (UPC) are calculated to QCD next-to-leading order in the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). The total cross section of $\eta_c$ produced in Pb-Pb UPC is 194 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ and 1052 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ at nucleon-nucleon c.m. energies $\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.52 TeV and 39.4 TeV, respectively. The cross sections for $\eta_b$ and $B_c$ mesons are more than two to three orders of magnitude smaller. We make a detailed phenomenological analysis on the $\eta_c$ production; the uncertainties caused by the renormalization scale and the charm quark mass, the cross sections in other ultraperipheral nucleon-nucleon colliding systems, and the transverse momentum distribution are discussed. At the coming HL-LHC and future FCC, the heavy ion UPC opens another door of the study on the production of heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <title>Large quark mass Euler-Heisenberg type action for QCD with quark sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark determinant in the presence of a background gluon field is calculated in a large quark mass derivative expansion by considering quark sources. The resulting low-energy QCD Effective Field Theory (EFT) is valid for non-homogeneous fields and it presents, besides the usual Euler-Heisenberg type gluon self-interactions, different types of corrections to the minimal quark-gluon interaction among which there are several imaginary terms. The Abelian limit of this effective action, i.e. an expanded Euler-Heisenberg effective action with fermion sources, is exhibit and it contains, therefore, corrections to the fermion-photon interactions, including imaginary parts. Different resulting properties are calculated such as: their contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and its trace, the Poynting vector, the chromo-electric permittivity and chromo-magnetic permeability. Conditions for these quantities, as well as for the corresponding Abelian limits, to be real are exhibited.</description>

      <title>The $L_\mu-L_\tau$ solution to the IceCube UHE neutrino deficit in light of NA64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the scenario where a MeV scale $L_\mu - L_\tau$ gauge boson can explain the deficit in the diffuse ultra high energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino spectrum observed in IceCube, as well as the discrepancy between experimental and $e^+e^-$ dispersion data driven SM calculations of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We map the parameter space of the model where the elastic resonant s-channel scattering of UHE neutrinos with the cosmic neutrino background, mediated by the new Z', can improve the description of the observed cascade and track spectra over the no-scattering hypothesis. Comparing to recent NA64$\mu$ results, we find that some part of the parameter space remains unexplored, but at a data volume of $10^{11}$ muons on target NA64$\mu$ will completely probe this region.</description>

      <title>A determination of FL at xmin with HERA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there are persistent statistical tensions with the standard model in the low Q2 HERA deep inelastic scattering neutral current data characterized by a turn-over of F2(x, Q2) at low x and low Q2. One important experimental signature that sheds light on this low Q2 region is the determination of the longitudinal structure function FL(x, Q2). This paper describes a novel method to determine FL based on an extrapolation of the reduced NC cross section at fixed s and Q to the minimum value of x given by Q2/s. At this kinematic point, the reduced cross section equals 2xF1 = F2 - FL so that a determination of both this value and the value of F2, determines FL. Since the polarization of the exchanged photon is transverse at this kinematic point, we expect FL to be small because its dominate gluon component is strongly suppressed. Surprisingly, we find FL at low Q2 to be much larger than expectation and observe that both FL and F2 at x = Q2/s show several properties consistent with the dipole picture. We discuss the statistical as well as chief systematic errors of our method and we tabulate our determinations of F2, 2xF1 and FL in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. Nearly half a century later, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to proton and neutron's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Confronting our state-of-the-art pQCD predictions with the available data for nucleon Dirac form factors, in both space-like and time-like regions, imposes a stringent test on the validity of the parameterized forms of nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which have been predicted by a class of QCD sum rules-based models and lattice QCD simulation.</description>

      <title>A new method for finding more symmetry relations of Feynman integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for deriving Feynman integral symmetry relation. By solving the ansatz of momentum transformation in the field of rational functions rather than constants, the method can sometimes find more symmetry relations, comparing with some state-of-art software. The new method may help to further decrease the number of master integrals in an integral family. Well-chosen gauge conditions are implemented in this method, for the efficient symmetry searching.</description>

      <title>Correlating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays and flavor observables in leptoquark models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate minimal scalar leptoquark models that dynamically generate neutrino Majorana masses at the one-loop level and examine their implications for low-energy processes. We show that these models can produce viable neutrino masses, consistent with neutrino oscillation and cosmological data. By using leptoquark couplings fixed by neutrino data, we predict additional contributions to neutrinoless double-beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$), which are chirality enhanced and compete with the standard contributions from the Majorana masses. Our analysis demonstrates that these effects are sizable for leptoquark masses as large as $\mathcal{O}(300~\mathrm{TeV})$, potentially increasing or decreasing the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life, and creating an ambiguity between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ and flavor observables, such as kaon decays and $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, emphasizing that the latter is complementary to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal production of heavy vector dark matter from relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy vector boson dark matter at the TeV scale or higher may be produced non-thermally in a first-order phase transition taking place at a lower energy scale. While the production of vector dark matter has previously been studied for bubble wall collisions, here we calculate production by bubble wall expansion in a plasma, which can be the dominant production mechanism. We compute the results numerically and provide an analytical fit for the vector dark matter density. The numerical fit is also validated for scalar dark matter production, obtaining results in agreement with past literature. We find that vector pair production leads to bubble wall friction with a novel boost factor scaling behaviour compared to transition radiation emission of a single vector. We conclude that TeV-scale WIMP vector dark matter can be efficiently produced non-thermally by first-order phase transitions in a wide region of parameter space where thermal freeze-out is inefficient. In this scenario, the phase transition scale is predicted to be in the sub-GeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV range and could therefore be accessible to future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Tau Tridents at Accelerator Neutrino Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of Standard Model (SM) neutrino tridents involving tau leptons at the near detectors of accelerator neutrino facilities. These processes were previously thought to be negligible, even at future facilities like DUNE, based on approximations that underestimated the tau trident cross sections. Our full $2\to 4$ calculation, including both coherent and incoherent scatterings, reveals that the DUNE near detector will actually get a non-negligible number of tau tridents, which is an important background to new physics searches. We identify promising kinematic features that may allow distinction of tau tridents from the usual neutrino charged-current background at DUNE, and thus could establish the observation of tau tridents for the first time. We also comment on the detection prospects at other accelerator and collider neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and the Finite Volume Fireball: A Model Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrino searches using next-generation gravitational wave detectors at radio neutrino detectors: GRAND, IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be sources of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and potential emitters of UHE neutrinos. The upcoming and current radio neutrino detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) are projected to reach the required sensitivities to search for these neutrinos. In particular, in conjunction with the next-generation of gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), GW-triggered stacking searches can be performed with the UHE neutrino detectors. In this work, we explore the prospects of such searches by implementing in our analysis an upper distance limit based on the sky-localization capabilities of the GW detectors from which meaningful triggers can be collected. We find that if each GW burst is associated with a total isotropic-equivalent energy of $\sim 10^{50} - 10^{51}$ erg emitted in UHE neutrinos, along with a corresponding beaming fraction of $1$\%, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 Radio have a large probability ($\sim 99$\%) to detect a coincident neutrino event using the joint combination of CE+ET in a timescale of less than 15 years of operation for our fiducial choice of parameters. In case of nondetections, the parameter spaces can be constrained at $3\sigma$ level in similar timescales of operation. We also highlight and discuss the prospects of such joint radio neutrino detector network, their importance, and their role in facilitating synergic GW and neutrino observations in the next era of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Coupled to Radiation: Limits from the Milky Way Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between dark matter (DM) and relativistic particles at early times suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, the scattering process transfers heat and momentum from radiation to DM, ultimately reducing the abundance of low-mass DM halos and the dwarf galaxies they host. Herein, we derive limits on DM--photon and DM--neutrino scattering cross section using the Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxy population. We consider temperature-independent interactions parameterized by DM mass ($m_\chi$) and DM--radiation interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\chi\text{--}i}$, where $i$ represents the target species). By requiring that the linear matter power spectra are strictly less suppressed than in the case of a thermal-relic warm DM, we derive the following $95\%$ upper limits at $m_\chi=1$ MeV: $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}\gamma}&lt;1.50\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$ and $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}\nu}&lt;2.41\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$. Our bounds on $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}i}$ depend linearly on $m_\chi$ for $m_\chi \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ and improve upon previous limits by an order of magnitude. The mass dependence of our limit approaches $m_\chi^3$ at lower masses due to the effects of DM sound speed; at $m_{\chi}=100~\mathrm{keV}$, we arrive at an upper limit over three orders of magnitude more stringent than achieved in previous explorations. Upcoming dwarf galaxy surveys will further improve the sensitivity of similar analyses, complementing laboratory and indirect detection searches for DM--radiation interactions.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>

      <title>Curbing PBHs with PTAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sizeable primordial curvature perturbations needed to seed a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be accompanied by a scalar-induced gravitational wave signal that can be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We derive conservative bounds on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at the PTA frequencies and estimate the implied constraints on the PBH abundance. We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics. The strength and the shape of the constraint depend on the shape of the power spectrum and the nature of the non-Gaussianities. We find that constraints on the PBH abundance arise in the mass range $0.1-10^3\, M_{\odot}$, with the sub-solar mass range being constrained only for narrow curvature power spectra. These constraints are softened when positive non-Gaussianity is introduced and can be eliminated when $f_{\rm NL} \gtrsim 5$. On the other hand, if the PBH abundance is computed via the theory of peaks, the PTA constraints on PBHs are significantly relaxed, signalling once more the theoretical uncertainties in assessing the PBH abundance. We further discuss how strong positive non-Gaussianites can allow for heavy PBHs to potentially seed supermassive BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a description of saturation in small $x$ deep inelastic scattering from power counting in a top-down effective theory derived from QCD. A factorization formula isolates the universal physics of the nucleus at leading power in $x$. The onset of saturation is then understood as a breakdown in the expansion in an emergent power counting parameter, which is defined by the matrix element of a gauge invariant operator. We identify a new radiation mode, which enables us to extend previous literature by distinguishing the appearance of the saturation scale from the transition to non-linear evolution.</description>

      <title>Illuminating all-hadronic final states with a photon: Exotic decays of the Higgs boson to four bottom quarks in vector boson fusion plus gamma at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to detect Higgs boson decays to four bottom quarks through a pair of pseudoscalars, a final state that is predicted by many theories beyond the Standard Model. For the first time, the signal sensitivity is evaluated for the final state using the vector boson fusion (VBF) production with and without an associated photon, for the Higgs at $m_H=125\,\textrm{GeV}$, at hadron colliders. The signal significance is $4$ to $6\sigma$, depending on the pseudoscalar mass $m_a$, when setting the the Higgs decay branching ratio to unity, using an integrated luminosity of $150\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\textrm{TeV}$. This corresponds to an upper limit of $0.3$, on the Higgs branching ratio to four bottom quarks, with a non-observation of the decay. We also consider several variations of selection requirements - input variables for the VBF tagging and the kinematic variables for the photon - that could help guide the design of new triggers for the Run-3 period of the LHC and for the HL-LHC.</description>

Abstract: We propose Generalized No-Scale Supergravity, the simplest scenario for Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry, naturally solving the supersymmetry electroweak fine-tuning problem and including natural dark matter. A light right-handed slepton bulk region is realized in $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ and the pMSSM. The bulk may be beyond the LHC reach, though can be probed at the 1000-day LUX-ZEPLIN, Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) at CERN, Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational-wave energy-density spectra from cosmological first-order phase transitions crucially depend on the terminal wall velocity of asymptotic bubble expansion when the driving force from the effective potential difference is gradually balanced by the backreaction force from the thermal plasma. Much attention has previously focused on the backreaction force acting on the bubble wall alone but overlooked the backreaction forces on the sound shell and shockwave front, if any, which have been both numerically and analytically accomplished in our previous studies but only for a bag equation of state. In this paper, we will generalize the backreaction force on bubble expansion beyond the simple bag model.</description>

      <title>Constraining kaon PDFs from Drell-Yan and $J/\psi$ production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are poorly known due to paucity of kaon-induced Drell-Yan data. Nevertheless, these Drell-Yan data suggest a softer valence $u$ quark distribution of kaon than that of pion. We discuss the opportunity to constrain kaon PDFs utilizing existing kaon-induced $J/\psi$ production data. We compare the $K^- / \pi^-$ and $K^+ / \pi^+$ cross-section ratio data with calculations based on two global-fit parametrizations and two recent theoretical predictions for the kaon and pion PDFs, and test the results with two quarkonium production models. The $K^- / \pi^-$ cross-section ratio for $J/\psi$ production provides independent evidence of different valence quark distributions in pion and kaon. The $K^+ / \pi^+$ $J/\psi$ data are found to be sensitive to the gluon distribution in kaon. We show that these $J/\psi$ production data provide valuable constraints for evaluating the adequacy of currently available sets of kaon PDFs.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: center-of-mass recoil effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For non-relativistic thermal dark matter, close-to-threshold effects largely dominate the evolution of the number density for most of the times after thermal freeze-out, and hence affect the cosmological relic density. A precise evaluation of the relevant interaction rates in a thermal medium representing the early universe includes accounting for the relative motion of the dark matter particles and the thermal medium. We consider a model of dark fermions interacting with a plasma of dark gauge bosons, which is equivalent to thermal QED. The temperature is taken to be smaller than the dark fermion mass and the inverse of the typical size of the dark fermion-antifermion bound states, which allows for the use of non-relativistic effective field theories. For the annihilation cross section, bound-state formation cross section, bound-state dissociation width and bound-state transition width of dark matter fermion-antifermion pairs, we compute the leading recoil effects in the reference frame of both the plasma and the center-of-mass of the fermion-antifermion pair. We explicitly verify the Lorentz transformations among these quantities. We evaluate the impact of the recoil corrections on the dark matter energy density. Our results can be directly applied to account for the relative motion of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. They may be also used to precisely assess thermal effects in atomic clocks based on atomic transitions; the present work provides a first field theory derivation of time dilation for these processes in vacuum and in a medium.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied the Vector Scotogenic Model in the context of the Dark Matter problem. Due to unitarity considerations, we have focused on the scenario with fermion dark matter, finding out that co-annihilations play a fundamental role in achieving dark matter relic abundance. Moreover, the coannihilation effects allow to separate the parameter space into two regions with different phenomenology. In addition, we have studied the detection prospects of these regions separately, focusing on signatures that can appear in lepton flavor violating decays, indirect and direct searches, and the production of these new particles at collider facilities.</description>

      <title>Revisit the heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the masses of heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules. Considering the double-gluon hybrid meson operators in the octet-octet color structure, we have constructed two independent interpolating currents with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and five independent currents with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$. For the interpolating currents with antisymmetric glueball operator, there exist non-local divergences in one kind of additional Feynman diagrams of the tri-gluon condensate, which will give important contributions to the sum rule stabilities and mass predictions. We use the diagrammatic renormalization to cancel out such divergences. At the leading order of $\alpha_s$, the two-point correlation functions and spectral densities can be expressed in the analytic form of the generalized hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G-functions. After performing the numerical analysis, we predict the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons to be around $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. For the bottomonium systems, their masses are predicted to be $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Besides, it is possible to hunt for these charmonium hybrids in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment. Further investigations on these hybrid states in various theoretical and phenomenological methods are also anticipated in the future.</description>

Abstract: The Bell nonlocality and entanglement are two kinds of quantum correlations in quantum systems. Due to the recent upgrade in Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment, it is possible to explore the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation with high precision data. We provide a systematic method for studying quantum correlations in spin-1/2 hyperon-antihyperon systems through the measures for the nonlocality and entanglement. We find that with nonvanishing polarizations of the hyperon and its antihyperon, the kinematic region of nonlocality in the hyperon-antihyperon system is more restricted than the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ system in which polarizations of $\tau$ leptons are vanishing. We also present an experimental proposal to probe the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems at BSEIII.</description>

      <title>One loop to rule them all: Perturbativity in the presence of ultra slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the issue of perturbativity in single-field inflationary models with a phase of ultra slow-roll (USR) tailor suited to generate an order-one abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). More in detail, we impose the condition that loop corrections made up of short-wavelength modes enhanced by the USR dynamics do not alter the tree-level power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In our analysis, the USR phase is preceded and followed by two stages of ordinary slow-roll (SR), and we model the resulting SR/USR/SR dynamics using both instantaneous and smooth transitions. Focusing on scales relevant for CMB observations, we find that it is not possible, with these arguments, to rule out the scenario of PBH formation via USR, not even in the limit of instantaneous transition. However, we also find that loop corrections of short modes on the power spectrum of long modes, even though not large enough to violate perturbativity requirements, remain appreciable and, most importantly, are not tamed in realistic realisations of smooth SR/USR/SR transitions. This makes perturbativity a powerful theoretical tool to constrain USR dynamics. We extend the analysis at any scale beyond those relevant for CMB observations. We find that loop corrections of short modes remain within the few percent if compared to the tree-level power spectrum. However, we also find one notable exception of phenomenological relevance: we show that the so-called dip in the power spectrum of curvature perturbation is an artifact of the tree-level computation.</description>

      <title>Weyl orbits as probe of chiral separation effect in magnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider magnetic Weyl semimetals. First of all we review relation of intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, band contribution to intrinsic magnetic moment, and the conductivity of chiral separation effect (CSE) to the topological invariants written in terms of the Wigner transformed Green functions (with effects of interaction and disorder taken into account). Next, we concentrate on the CSE. The corresponding bulk axial current is accompanied by the flow of the states in momentum space along the Fermi arcs. Together with the bulk CSE current this flow forms closed Weyl orbits. Their detection can be considered as experimental discovery of chiral separation effect. Previously it was proposed to detect Weyl orbits through the observation of quantum oscillations \cite{Potter_2014} . We propose the alternative way to detect existence of Weyl orbits through the observation of their contributions to Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Black Hole Abundance: The Broader, the Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the abundance of primordial black holes, if formed through the collapse of large fluctuations generated during inflation and unless the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is very peaked, is always dominated by the broadest profile of the compaction function, even though statistically it is not the most frequent. The corresponding threshold is therefore 2/5. This result exacerbates the tension when combining the primordial black hole abundance with the signal seen by pulsar timing arrays and originated from gravitational waves induced by the same large primordial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon mass via the Shapiro effect in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set an upper bound on the photon mass, namely $m_\gamma &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$ at $95\%$ CL. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially by a factor of ten. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our bound is at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational bending of light by the Sun.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may produce Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles even when the energy of electric fields is smaller than KK scale. As an illustrating example, we consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged Kaluza-Klein particle non-perturbatively, which we call KK Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion. We also discuss the subtlety of four dimensional effective theory truncated by KK modes at an initial time, when the electric field is turned on.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of $K^\ast$ induced by strange-baryon density inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The difference between the spin alignments of $K^\ast$ and those of $\phi$ at the low collision energies is a puzzle raised by the recent experiments. Unlike $\phi$ meson, $K^\ast$, carrying a unit strange charge, should react to strange chemical potential $\mu_S$. In this paper, we shall first convince you that $\mu_S$ is not small in a brayon-rich medium for keeping strange neutrality, and then derive the spin alignment induced by the gradient of $\mu_S$, and hence of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, using linear response theory, with the transport coefficients expressed, without any approximation, in terms of the $K^\ast$'s in-medium spectral properties by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. It turns out that such an effect applies mainly to the particles whose longitudinal and transverse modes diverge, and induces only the local spin alignment in a static medium. The magnitudes of these coefficients will be further estimated under the quasi-particle approximation.</description>

      <title>$K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction with in-flight kaons for studying the $\Lambda N$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra for the reactions $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^-\Lambda p$ and $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^0\Lambda n$ are calculated for experimental study of isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ scattering at low energies, the difference in the scattering lengths and effective ranges of $\Lambda p$ and $\Lambda n$ systems. The calculations are performed for in-flight kaons with a momentum of 1000 MeV/c with employing partial wave analysis up to the p-wave for meson-baryon amplitudes and the spin-flip term for baryon-baryon amplitudes. Kinematic selection is utilized to suppress the background processes by selecting forward-emitting pions and higher momentum nucleons. It is worth noting that isospin symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ system can be extracted from the difference of the $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectra between the $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^-\Lambda p$ and $K^-d\rightarrow\pi^0\Lambda n$ reactions.</description>

      <title>Using gauge invariance to symmetrize the energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that using Noether's Theorem explicitly employing gauge invariance for variations of the electromagnetic four-potential $A^\mu$ straightforwardly ensures that the resulting electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. The Belinfante symmetrization procedure is not necessary. The method is based on Bessel-Hagen's 1921 clarification of Noether's original procedure, suggesting that the symmetry problem arises from an incomplete implementation of Noether's Theorem. The derivation addresses in some detail where the usual application of Noether's Theorem falls short, what the Belinfante procedure actually does to fix the problem, and why the usual unsymmetric canonical energy-momentum tensor can only be used for extracting four-momentum conservation based on translational invariance, but will provide meaningless results when applied to rotations or boosts, unless modified appropriately.</description>
