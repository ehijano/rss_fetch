      <title>Insights on Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.</description>

      <title>Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\rm e}=3.1380\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\rm H}\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\approx14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\lambda991.51$ (${\rm log}\,n_{\rm c}=3.3\,\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\sim1.5-6.0\,Z\rm\,sun$, and is located at $\sim15\,\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.</description>

      <title>An efficient unsupervised classification model for galaxy morphology: Voting clustering based on coding from ConvNeXt large model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\rm mag}&lt; 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)&gt;10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.</description>

      <title>Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\gtrsim 30\degree$, at $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.</description>

      <title>JWST-ALMA Study of a Hub-Filament System in the Nascent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $&lt;0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.</description>

      <title>Excess Ultraviolet Emission at High Galactic Latitudes: A New Horizons View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new observations of the cosmic ultraviolet background (CUVB) at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| &gt; 40^{\circ}$), made using the Alice UV spectrograph on board the New Horizons spacecraft. These observations were taken at about 57 AU from the Sun, outside much of the foreground emission affecting previous missions, and allowed a new determination of the spectrum of the CUVB between 912 -- 1100~\AA\ and 1400 -- 1800~\AA. We found a linear correlation between the CUVB and the Planck E(B~-~V) with offsets at zero-reddening of $221 \pm 11$ photon units at 1000~\AA\ and $264 \pm 24$ \photu\ at 1500~\AA\ ($4.4 \pm 0.2$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1000~\AA\ and $5.3 \pm 0.5$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1500~\AA). The former is the first firm detection of the offset in the range 912 -- 1100 \AA\ while the latter result confirms previous results from \galex, showing that there is little emission from the Solar System from 1400 -- 1800 \AA. About half of the offset may be explained by known sources (the integrated light of unresolved galaxies, unresolved stars, emission from ionized gas, and two-photon emission from warm hydrogen in the halo) with the source of the remaining emission as yet unidentified. There is no detectable emission below the Lyman limit with an upper limit of $3.2 \pm 3.0$ photon units.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the kinematic and morphological evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (&lt; 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (&lt; 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\circ$ to 82$^\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\Theta$ (~ 180$^\circ$ to 240$^\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Testing the extended corona model with the optical/UV reverberation mapping of the accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppost model.The most recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups. Larger black hole mass and considerably lower Eddington ratio would allow to see larger differences between a single lamppost and a two-lampost model. UV/optical reverberation mapping is not very sensitive to the vertical extension of the corona.</description>

      <title>An intriguing coincidence between the majority of the VPOS dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.</description>

      <title>The $z \gtrsim 9$ galaxy UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey: insights into early galaxy evolution and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\mathrm{UV}\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\geq14$ subset of the $z\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.</description>

      <title>Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC). VII. Disentangling Mass and Environment Quenching with the Aid of Galaxy-halo Connection in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the two effects.To address this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\bar{n}_2w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of 1.2$M_\odot$ to 2.0$M_\odot$ main-sequence and turn-off stars constrain the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{Kepler} and \textit{Gaia} data shows an anomaly in the angular momentum-age relationship for 1.2-2 main-sequence stars. After considering model-induced correlation of parameters, the moment of inertia, stellar velocity distribution, sample selection effects, interactions between the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies, the star-disk interaction during the early pre-main sequence, and the angular momentum change on the main sequence, this work suggests that the earlier the star within this mass range born, the smaller the angular momentum at the time of born, following an exponential decay relationship. This relationship should be attributed to the variation in molecular cloud parameters throughout the history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting pulsed CH maser emission in the interstellar medium stimulated by pulsar photons.</description>

      <title>The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z&lt;1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>FEASTS: Radial Distribution of HI surface densities down to 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ of 35 Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the HI surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\sim10^{18.1}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Variability of Luminous Blue Variable Stars with TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar emission of Cepheids across the instability strip: Mid-infrared observations with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\,\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\,R_\star$ and $f_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.</description>

      <title>A Novel Survey for Young Substellar Objects with the W-band Filter. VII. Water-Bearing Objects in the Core of the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-5}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>SpecPT (Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer) Model for Extragalactic Spectroscopy: I. Architecture and Automated Redshift Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Lyman Continuum Escape Fraction of Star-forming Galaxies at $2.4\lesssim z\lesssim3.0$ from UVCANDELS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UltraViolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-26 Treasury Program, allocated in total 164 orbits of primary Wide-Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and Visible light F275W imaging with coordinated parallel Advanced Camera for Surveys F435W imaging, on four of the five premier extragalactic survey fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. We introduce this survey by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the absolute escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$) of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation through stacking the UV images of a population of star-forming galaxies with secure redshifts at $2.4\leq z\leq3.0$. Our stacking benefits from the catalogs of high-quality spectroscopic redshifts compiled from archival ground-based data and HST slitless spectroscopy, carefully vetted by dedicated visual inspection efforts. We develop a robust stacking method to apply to 10 samples of in total 56 galaxies, and perform detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, to take into account the sample variance of the mean IGM transmission when measuring $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$. The full stack at $z\approx2.44$ from 28 galaxies places a stringent 1-$\sigma$ upper limit of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}\lesssim5\%$, whereas the full stack at $z\approx2.72$ of equal number of galaxies gives an upper limit of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}\lesssim26\%$ at 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. These new F275W and F435W imaging mosaics from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).</description>

      <title>The structure of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy explored with the NB515 for Subaru/HSC. I.: New Insights on the stellar halo up to 120 kpc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the M31 halo and its substructure within a projected radius of 120 kpc using a combination of Subaru/HSC $\textit{NB515}$ and CFHT/MegaCam $\textit{g}$- \&amp; $\textit{i}$-bands. We succeed in separating M31's halo stars from foreground contamination with $\sim$ 90 \% accuracy by using the surface gravity sensitive $\textit{NB515}$ filter. Based on the selected M31 halo stars, we discover three new substructures, which associate with the Giant Southern Stream (GSS) based on their photometric metallicity estimates. We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity estimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are reproduced in our study, we find that the North-Western stream shows a steeper distance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely to have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the eastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been resolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity distribution and surface brightness profile using the $\textit{NB515}$-selected halo stars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich halo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=-1.65\pm0.02$, $-2.82\pm0.01$, and $-2.44\pm0.01$, respectively. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo profile, its photometric metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with nonmonotonic trends with radius, suggesting that the halo population had insufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic field of the Milky Way halo, Local Bubble and Fan Region</title>

Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provides us with a wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>Globular Cluster Counts around 700 Nearby Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirically, the total number (or total mass) of globular clusters bound in a single galactic system correlates with the viral mass of the system. The form of this relation and its intrinsic scatter are potentially valuable constraints on theories of globular cluster formation and galaxy evolution. In this work, we use the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey to make a large-scale, homogeneous estimate of GC abundance around 707 galaxies at distances $\lesssim 30\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ with luminosities $8 \leq \log_{10}L/\mathrm{L}_\odot \leq 11.5$. The combination of depth and sky coverage in DESI-LS allow us to extend the techniques used by previous ground-based photometric GC surveys to a larger and potentially more representative sample of galaxies. We find average GC counts and radial profiles that are broadly consistent with the literature on individual galaxies, including good agreement with the distribution of GCs in the Milky Way, demonstrating the viability of DESI-LS images for this purpose. We find a relation between GC counts and virial mass in agreement with previous estimates based on heterogenous datasets, except at the lowest masses we probe, where we find a larger scatter in the number of cluster candidates and a slightly higher average count.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model of Gravitational Collapse Induced by Radiative Cooling: Instability Scale, Infall Velocity, and Accretion Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds, which illustrates the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability at a characteristic mass scale determined by the microphysics of the gas. The approach is based on developing the "one-zone" density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities, we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, we show that our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Search for Strongly Lensed Quasars in KiDS DR5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\tt{MAG\_AUTO} &lt; 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online. We have also included an excellent quad candidate in the appendix, discovered serendipitously during the fine-tuning process of the CNN.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Baryonic Feedback on Warm-Hot Circumgalactic Medium in CAMELS Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. Parameters controlling stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, non-linear interactions between AGN and SNe feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.</description>

      <title>MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XII. Rationale and design of a MgII survey of the cool circum-galactic medium with MUSE and UVES: The MEGAFLOW Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, rationale, properties and catalogs of the MusE Gas FLOw and Wind survey (MEGAFLOW), a survey of the cool gaseous halos of $z\sim1$ galaxies using low-ionization MgII absorption systems. The survey consists of 22 quasar fields selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having multiple ($\geq3$) strong MgII absorption lines over the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$. Each quasar was observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), for a total of 85~hr and 63~hr, respectively. The UVES data resulted in 127 MgII absorption lines over $0.25&lt;z&lt;1.6$, with a median rest-frame equivalent width (REW) $3\sigma$ limit of $\approx 0.05$~\AA. The MUSE data resulted in $\sim$2400 galaxies of which 1403 with redshift confidence ZCONF$&gt;1$, i.e. more than 60 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$. They were identified using a dual detection algorithm based on both continuum and emission line objects. The achieved [OII] 50\%\ completeness is 3.7$\times 10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ (corresponding to SFR$&gt;0.01$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=1$) using realistic mock [OII] emitters and the 50\%\ completeness is $m_{F775W}\approx26$ AB magnitudes for continuum sources. We find that (i) the fraction of [OII] emitting galaxies which have no continuum is $\sim15$\%; (ii) the success rate in identifying at least one galaxy within 500 km/s and 100 kpc is $\approx90$\%\ for MgII absorptions with $W_r^{2796}\gtrsim0.5$~\AA; (iii) the mean number of galaxies per MgII absorption is $2.9\pm1.6$ within the MUSE field-of-view; (iv) of the 80 MgII systems at $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$, 40 (20) have 1 (2) galaxies within 100 kpc, respectively; (v) all but two host galaxies have stellar masses $M_\star&gt;10^9$ M$_\odot$, and star-formation rates $&gt;1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the orbits of cluster galaxy populations according to their dominant gas ionization source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of cluster galaxy populations classified according to their dominant source of gas ionization, namely: star-forming (SF) galaxies, optical active galactic nuclei (AGN), mixed SF plus AGN ionization (transition objects, T), and quiescent (Q) galaxies. We stack 8892 member galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate the observed projected profiles of numerical density and velocity dispersion, $\sigma_P(R)$, of each galaxy population. The MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equations inversion technique are used to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles of the galaxy populations in both parametric and non-parametric ways. We find that Q (SF) galaxies display the lowest (highest) typical cluster-centric distances and velocity dispersion values. Transition galaxies are more concentrated and tend to exhibit lower velocity dispersion values than SF galaxies. Galaxies that host an optical AGN are as concentrated as Q galaxies but display velocity dispersion values similar to those of the SF population. MAMPOSSt is able to find equilibrium solutions that successfully recover the observed $\sigma_P(R)$ profile only for the Q, T, and AGN populations. We find that the orbits of all populations are consistent with isotropy in the inner regions, becoming increasingly radial with the distance from the cluster centre. These results suggest that Q galaxies are in equilibrium within their clusters, while SF galaxies have more recently arrived in the cluster environment. Finally, the T and AGN populations appear to be in an intermediate dynamical state between those of the SF and Q populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.</description>
