      <title>A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes</title>

Abstract: The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction. Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. Despite their widespread adoption, SBGN languages remain purely visual and lack an underlying mathematical framework, limiting their compositional analysis, abstraction, and integration with formal modelling approaches. SBGN comprises three complementary visual languages-Process Description (SBGN-PD), Activity Flow (SBGN-AF), and Entity Relationship (SBGN-ER)-each operating at a different level of abstraction.
  In this manuscript, we introduce a category-theoretic formalism for SBGN-PD, a visual language to describe biochemical processes as biochemical reaction networks. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category whose horizontal 1-morphisms correspond to SBGN-PD diagrams. We also analyse how a designated subnetwork influences the surrounding network and how external entities, in turn, affect the internal reactions of the subnetwork. Our work addresses a key gap between biological visualisation and mathematical structure. It provides precise organising principles for SBGN-PD, including compositionality, enabling the construction of large biochemical reaction networks from smaller ones, and zooming out, allowing the abstraction of detailed biochemical mechanisms while preserving their functional interfaces. Throughout the paper, the proposed framework is illustrated using standard SBGN-PD examples, demonstrating its applicability to large-scale biochemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing information transmission in optogenetic Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals: using either no Wnt, a short Wnt pulse, or a sustained Wnt signal. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned to achieve near-optimal information transmission. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of different signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.</description>
