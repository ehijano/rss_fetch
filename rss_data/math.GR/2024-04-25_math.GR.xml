      <title>Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$ in Coexeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group has Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$ if it does not admit a loxodromic element in any hyperbolic action. In other words, a group with this property is inaccessible for study from the perspective of hyperbolic actions. This property was introduced by Balasubramanya, Fournier-Facio and Genevois, who initiated the study of this property. We expand on this research by studying Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$ in Coxeter groups, a class of groups that are defined by an underlying graph. One of our main results show that a right-angled Coxeter group (RACG) has Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$ if and only if its defining graph is complete. We then move beyond the right-angled case to show that if a defining graph is disconnected, its corresponding Coxeter group does not have Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$. Lastly, we classify which triangle groups (Coxeter groups with three generators) have Property $\mathrm{(NL)}$.</description>

      <title>Right-angled Artin subgroups and free products in one-relator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate criteria ensuring that a one-relator group $G$ contains a right-angled Artin subgroup $A(\Gamma)$, corresponding to a finite graph $\Gamma$. In particular, we prove that if the positive submonoid $T(\Gamma)$, of $A(\Gamma)$, embeds into $G$ then so does all of $A(\Gamma)$, unless $\Gamma$ is totally disconnected. As by-products of our methods we obtain characterisations of one-relator groups that have property $P_{nai}$ and that are $C^*$-simple.</description>

      <title>Rotation groups virtually embed into right-angled rotation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a theorem due to F. Haglund and D. Wise that reflection groups (aka Coxeter groups) virtually embed into right-angled reflection groups (aka right-angled Coxeter groups). In this article, we generalise this observation to rotation groups, which can be thought of as a common generalisation of Coxeter groups and graph products of groups. More precisely, we prove that rotation groups (aka periagroups) virtually embed into right-angled rotation groups (aka graph products of groups).</description>

      <title>Statistically characterized subgroups related to some non-arithmetic sequence of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently in [15], characterized subgroups are investigated for some special kind non-arithmetic sequences. In this note we study subsequent problems in case of "statistically characterized subgroups" introduced in [18]. The whole investigation again reiterates that these statistically characterized subgroups behave in a much different manner compared to classical characterized subgroups which resolves an open question raised in [18]. After that we have provided the first ever example of a statistically characterized subgroup which is countable resolving many open problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>The stable Albanese homology of the IA-automorphism groups of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IA-automorphism group $\operatorname{IA}_n$ of the free group $F_n$ of rank $n$ is a normal subgroup of the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ of $F_n$. We study the Albanese homology of $\operatorname{IA}_n$, which is the quotient of the rational homology of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ defined as the image of the map induced by the abelianization map of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ on homology. The Albanese homology of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ is an algebraic $\operatorname{GL}(n,\mathbb{Q})$-representation. We determine the representation structure of the Albanese homology of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ for $n$ greater than or equal to three times the homological degree. We also determine the structure of the stable Albanese homology of the analogue of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ to the outer automorphism group of $F_n$. Moreover, we identify the relation between the stable Albanese (co)homology of $\operatorname{IA}_n$ and the stable cohomology of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ with certain twisted coefficients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for each $n \geq 2$, the systoles of closed hyperbolic $n$-manifolds form a dense subset of $(0, +\infty)$. We also show that for any $n\geq 2$ and any Salem number $\lambda$, there is a closed arithmetic hyperbolic $n$-manifold of systole $\log(\lambda)$. In particular, the Salem conjecture holds if and only if the systoles of closed arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds in some (any) dimension fail to be dense in $(0, +\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids, recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier analysis in the SO(3) space : EquiLoPO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing volumetric data with rotational invariance or equivariance is an active topic in current research. Existing deep-learning approaches utilize either group convolutional networks limited to discrete rotations or steerable convolutional networks with constrained filter structures. This work proposes a novel equivariant neural network architecture that achieves analytical Equivariance to Local Pattern Orientation on the continuous SO(3) group while allowing unconstrained trainable filters - EquiLoPO Network. Our key innovations are a group convolutional operation leveraging irreducible representations as the Fourier basis and a local activation function in the SO(3) space that provides a well-defined mapping from input to output functions, preserving equivariance. By integrating these operations into a ResNet-style architecture, we propose a model that overcomes the limitations of prior methods. A comprehensive evaluation on diverse 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently outperforms state of the art. This work suggests the benefits of true rotational equivariance on SO(3) and flexible unconstrained filters enabled by the local activation function, providing a flexible framework for equivariant deep learning on volumetric data with potential applications across domains. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/GruLab/ILPO/-/tree/main/EquiLoPO}.</description>

Abstract: We prove a first part of the standard description of groups $H$ lying between an exterior power of an elementary group $\bigwedge^m E_n(R)$ and a general linear group $GL_{n \choose m}(R)$ for a commutative ring $R$, $2\in R^*$ and $n\geqslant 3m$. The description uses the classical notion of a level: for every group $H$ we find a unique ideal $A$ of the ground ring $R$ which describes $H$.</description>

Abstract: Let $ G $ be a Lie group with Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g} $. An element $ X \in \mathfrak{g} $ is called $\mathrm{Ad}_G$-real if $ -X=gXg^{-1} $ for some $ g \in G $. Moreover, if $ -X=gXg^{-1} $ holds for some involution $ g\in G $, then $ X $ is called strongly $\mathrm{Ad}_G$-real. We have classified the $\mathrm{Ad}_G$-real and the strongly $\mathrm{Ad}_G$-real orbits in the special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{F}) $ for $ \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{H} $.</description>

      <title>Improved Parallel Algorithms for Baumslag Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Baumslag group had been a candidate for a group with an extremely difficult word problem until Myasnikov, Ushakov, and Won succeeded to show that its word problem can be solved in polynomial time. Their result used the newly developed data structure of power circuits allowing for a non-elementary compression of integers. Later this was extended in two directions: Laun showed that the same applies to the Baumslag groups $G_{1, q}$ for $q \geq 2$ and we established that the word problem of the Baumslag group $G_{1, 2}$ can be solved in $\mathsf{TC}^2$.
  In this work we refine the operations on reduced power circuits to further improve upon both results. We show that the word problem of the Baumslag groups $G_{p, pq}$ with $|p|,|q| \geq 1$ can be solved in $\mathsf{uTC}^1$. Moreover, we prove that the conjugacy problem in $G_{p, pq}$ is strongly generically in $\mathsf{uTC}^1$ (meaning that for "most" inputs it is in $\mathsf{uTC}^1$). Finally, for every fixed $g \in G_{1, q}$ (case $p=1$) conjugacy to $g$ can be decided in $\mathsf{uTC}^1$ for all inputs.
  We further show that the word problem of the Baumslag-Solitar groups $BS_{p, pq}$ is in $\mathsf{uAC}^0(F_2)$ if the input word is given in a quite compressed form and so give a complexity result for a special case of the power word problem for these groups.</description>

      <title>Overgroups of exterior powers of an elementary group. Normalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two characterizations of an algebraic group scheme $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. Geometrically, the scheme $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ is a stabilizer of an explicitly given invariant form or, generally, an invariant ideal of forms. Algebraically, $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ is isomorphic (as a scheme over $\mathbb{Z}$) to a normalizer of the elementary subgroup functor $\bigwedge^m E_n$ and a normalizer of the subscheme $\bigwedge^m SL_n$.
  Our immediate goal is to apply both descriptions in the "sandwich classification" of overgroups of the elementary subgroup. Additionally, the results can be seen as a solution of the linear preserver problem for algebraic group schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$, providing a more functorial description that goes beyond geometry of the classical case over fields.</description>

Abstract: In our first paper, we looked at $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type with skew axet $X'(1+2)$. We continue our work by focusing on larger skew axets and classifying all such algebras with skew axets.

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>

      <title>The Johnson-Morita theory for the handlebody group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johnson-Morita theory is an algebraic approach to the mapping class group of a surface, in which one considers its action on the successive nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group of the surface. In this paper, we develop an analogue of this theory for the handlebody group, i.e. the mapping class group of a 3-dimensional handlebody. Thus, we obtain a filtration on the handlebody group, prove that its associated graded embeds into a Lie algebra of "special derivations", and give an explicit diagrammatic description of this graded Lie algebra in terms of "oriented trees with beads". Our new diagrammatic method reveals part of the richness of the algebraic structure of the handlebody group, which lies mainly in the subgroup generated by Dehn twists along meridians: the so-called "twist group". As an application, we obtain that each term of the associated graded of the lower central series of the twist group is infinitely generated.</description>

      <title>On the Constant-Depth Circuit Complexity of Generating Quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-depth circuit complexity of the Isomorphism Problem, Minimum Generating Set Problem (MGS), and Sub(quasi)group Membership Problem (Membership) for groups and quasigroups (=Latin squares), given as input in terms of their multiplication (Cayley) tables. Despite decades of research on these problems, lower bounds for these problems even against depth-$2$ AC circuits remain unknown. Perhaps surprisingly, Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, and Wagner (FSTTCS 2010; ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 2013) showed that Quasigroup Isomorphism could be solved by AC circuits of depth $O(\log \log n)$ using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits, a class we denote $\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL$. We narrow this gap by improving the upper bound for many of these problems to $quasiAC^0$, thus decreasing the depth to constant.
  In particular, we show:
  - MGS for quasigroups is in $\exists^{\log^2(n)}\forall^{\log n}NTIME(\mathrm{polylog}(n))\subseteq quasiAC^0$. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1996) conjectured that this problem was $\exists^{\log^2(n)}P$-complete; our results refute a version of that conjecture for completeness under $quasiAC^0$ reductions unconditionally, and under polylog-space reductions assuming EXP $\neq$ PSPACE.
  - MGS for groups is in $AC^{1}(L)$, improving on the previous upper bound of $P$ (Lucchini &amp; Thakkar, J. Algebra, 2024).
  - Quasigroup Isomorphism belongs to $\exists^{\log^2(n)}AC^0(DTISP(\mathrm{polylog},\log)\subseteq quasiAC^0$, improving on the previous bound of $\exists^{\log^2(n)}L\cap\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL\subseteq quasiFOLL$ (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, &amp; Wagner, ibid.; Levet, Australas. J. Combin., 2023).
  Our results suggest that understanding the constant-depth circuit complexity may be key to resolving the complexity of problems concerning (quasi)groups in the multiplication table model.</description>
