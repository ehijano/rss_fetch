      <title>Shared and distinct exonic parts in alternative paths of splicing bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative splicing creates complex bubbles in splicing graphs where more than two transcript paths compete, challenging methods designed for simple binary events. We present a unified framework that compares paths using distinct exonic parts observed directly from reads. We build a GrASE splicing graph (DAG) per gene, enumerate bubbles, and quantify shared and distinct exonic parts across three comparison structures. (i) all-pairwise contrasts (ii) a multinomial n-way comparison and (iii) valid bipartitions of paths. For (iii) we introduce lower-set bipartitioning, which respects subset relations among paths by enumerating downward-closed sets in a containment graph, yielding valid two-group splits with nonempty distinguishing parts. Our test statistic is the fraction of reads mapped to distinct parts relative to distinct + shared parts, enabling differential usage across samples. Applied to genome annotations, the approach examines more bubbles than prior tools while remaining tractable and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Integrating Epigenetic and Phenotypic Features for Biological Age Estimation in Cancer Patients via Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological age, which may be older or younger than chronological age due to factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, serves as a meaningful biomarker of aging processes and can inform risk stratification, treatment planning, and survivorship care in cancer patients. We propose EpiCAge, a multimodal framework that integrates epigenetic and phenotypic data to improve biological age prediction. Evaluated on eight internal and four external cancer cohorts, EpiCAge consistently outperforms existing epigenetic and phenotypic age clocks. Our analyses show that EpiCAge identifies biologically relevant markers, and its derived age acceleration is significantly associated with mortality risk. These results highlight EpiCAge as a promising multimodal machine learning tool for biological age assessment in oncology.</description>

      <title>scUnified: An AI-Ready Standardized Resource for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species (human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a unified dataset.</description>

      <title>Advancing Risk Gene Discovery Across the Allele Frequency Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited, pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.</description>
