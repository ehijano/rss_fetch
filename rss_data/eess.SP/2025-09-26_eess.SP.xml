      <title>Real-Time Markov Modeling for Single-Photon LiDAR: $1000 \times$ Acceleration and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However, constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods. The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in the literature but are critical to the convergence.</description>

      <title>Wireless Powered MEC Systems via Discrete Pinching Antennas: TDMA versus NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior computation performance over NOMA.</description>

      <title>A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization. Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study, we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%, while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy, SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Integrated Sensing and Communication for the MIMO-OFDM Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically, our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication pipeline or reducing data rates.</description>

      <title>A Secure ISAC Waveform Design Framework via Random Frequency and PRI Agility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate, and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI) agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust MIMO Physical Layer Authentication for Non-Stationary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA) framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations, which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential authentication schemes.</description>

      <title>An enhanced statistical feature fusion approach using an improved distance evaluation algorithm and weighted K-nearest neighbor for bearing fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery, and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However, detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.</description>

      <title>Vision-Intelligence-Enabled Beam Tracking for Cross-Interface Water-Air Optical Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission. However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging, especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh conditions of water-air OWC systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Digital Methods to Quantify Sensor Output Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations, which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final, compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy. We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup, paving the way for use in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their deployment on wearable devices faces real-time processing, privacy, and spoofing vulnerability challenges. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU) for ECG-based authentication, injection of 20dB Gaussian noise &amp; custom preprocessing. We simulate wearable conditions and edge deployment using the ECGID, MIT-BIH, CYBHi, and PTB datasets, achieving accuracies of 99.34%, 99.31%, 91.74%, and 98.49%, F1-scores of 0.9869, 0.9923, 0.9125, and 0.9771, Precision of 0.9866, 0.9924, 0.9180 and 0.9845, Recall of 0.9878, 0.9923, 0.9129, and 0.9756, equal error rates (EER) of 0.0009, 0.00013, 0.0091, and 0.0009, and ROC-AUC values of 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9985, and 0.9998, while under FGSM adversarial attacks, accuracy drops from 96.82% to as low as 0.80%. This paper highlights federated learning, adversarial testing, and the need for diverse wearable physiological datasets to ensure secure and scalable biometrics.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</description>

      <title>A Recovery Theory for Diffusion Priors: Deterministic Analysis of the Implicit Prior Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \&amp; Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.</description>

      <title>4D Computational Ultrasound Imaging of Carotid Artery Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) with few elements and spatial field encoding can provide high-resolution volumetric B-mode imaging. In this work, we extend its application to 4D carotid artery (CA) flow imaging using a custom large-aperture 240-element matrix probe. We implemented a frequency band-based matched filtering strategy that balances resolution and contrast. The system's inherent imaging capabilities were evaluated and validated in flow phantom and human CA experiments. In the phantom study, 3D/4D power Doppler image and speckle-tracking analyses confirmed the system's ability to resolve flow structures and hemodynamics. In the human study, the CA bifurcation flow structure and its local pulsatile flow dynamics were successfully reconstructed. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a large-footprint, few-element cUSi system for 4D CA flow assessment.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems with Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions, and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</description>

      <title>Frugal RIS-aided 3D Localization with CFO under LoS and NLoS Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate 3-D localization and frequency synchronization with multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) for a stationary user equipment (UE). In line with the 6G goals of sustainability and efficiency, we focus on a frugal communication scenario with minimal spatial and spectral resources (i.e., narrowband single-input single-ouput system), considering both the presence and blockage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path between the base station (BS) and the UE. We design a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based LoS detector, channel parameter estimation and localization algorithms, with varying complexity. To verify the efficiency of our estimators, we compare the root mean-squared error (RMSE) to the Cram\'er- Rao bound (CRB) of the unknown parameters. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our algorithms to the presence of uncontrolled multi-path components (MPC) and various levels of CFO. Simulation results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under minimal hardware and spectral requirements, and a wide range of operating conditions, thereby confirming the viability of RIS-aided frugal localization in 6G scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal Scanning GUI Tool for Available and Usable TV White Space (TVWS) Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this era of advanced communication technologies, many remote rural and hard-to-reach areas still lack Internet access due to technological, geographical, and economic challenges. The TV white space (TVWS) technology has proven to be effective and feasible in connecting these areas to Internet service in many parts of the world. The TVWS-based systems operate based on geolocation white space databases (WSDB) to protect the primary systems from harmful interference. Thus, there is a critical need to identify the available and usable channels that can be utilized by secondary white space devices (WSDs) in a specific geographic area. In this work, we developed a generalized and flexible graphical user interface (GUI) tool to evaluate the availability and usability of the TVWS channels and their noise levels at each geographic location within the analyzed area. The developed tool has many features and capabilities, such as allowing users to scan the TVWS spectrum for any geographic area in the world and any frequency band in the TVWS spectrum. Moreover, it allows the user to apply widely used terrain-based radio propagation models. It provides the flexibility to import the elevation terrain profile of any region with the desired spatial accuracy and resolution. In addition, various system parameters, including those related to regulation rules, can be modified in the tool. This tool exports to an external dataset file the output data of the available and usable TVWS channels and their noise levels, and it also visualizes these data interactively. Moreover, we develop an RF planning and optimization algorithm in this tool to evaluate the various communication metrics between the TVWS BS and the user equipment (UEs). This tool also provides an RF optimization technique using Ray Tracing to find the best azimuth and elevation orientation for both the BS and the UE antennas.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-derived Photoplethysmography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG), increasingly available through wearable devices, provides a non-invasive means of monitoring human hemodynamics. In this study, we introduce artificial intelligence-derived photoplethysmography (AI-PPG) age, a deep learning-based estimate of biological age from raw PPG signals, and evaluate its potential as a digital biomarker for cardiovascular health.
  Methods: We developed a deep learning model with a distribution-aware loss function to reduce bias from imbalanced data. The model was trained and evaluated on the UK Biobank cohort (N = 212,231). We analyzed the association between the AI-PPG age gap (AI-PPG age minus calendar age) and multiple cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, assessed its longitudinal value using serial PPG measurements, and externally validated its generalizability in an independent MIMIC-III-derived cohort (N = 2,343).
  Results: After adjusting for key confounders, participants with an AI-PPG age gap greater than 9 years have a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio of 2.37, p = 8.46x10$^{-80}$), as well as seven secondary outcomes including coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (all p &lt; 0.005). Conversely, those with a gap below -9 years show a lower risk profile. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates that changes in AI-PPG age add predictive value over time. In the external validation cohort, each one-year increase in AI-PPG age gap is associated with higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio of 1.02, p = 0.01).
  Conclusions: AI-PPG age is a scalable, non-invasive biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment. Integrated with wearable devices, it may enable population-level screening, personalized monitoring, and early intervention.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic Channel Sounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless systems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short measurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and spatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive option that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement times of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then essential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter estimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design of switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal ambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its prohibitive complexity when applied to ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus propose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the estimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a switching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this sense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity reduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design approach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the Fourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower computational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based approach.</description>

      <title>Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches Free From Lipschitz Constant Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) is a disruptive tech-nology for future wireless communication networks. This paper considers the joint optimization of beamforming matrices and antenna positions for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization in fluid antenna (FA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks, which presents significant chal-lenges due to the strong coupling between beamforming and FA positions, the non-concavity of the WSR objective function, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method that employs matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we develop a parallel majorization maximization (MM) algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simul-taneously. To further reduce computational costs, we propose a decentralized implementation based on the decentralized base-band processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demon-strate that our proposed algorithm not only achieves significant WSR improvements over conventional MIMO networks but also outperforms the existing method. Moreover, the decentralized implementation substantially reduces computation time while maintaining similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Detection for Noncoherent Massive MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Lo\`eve domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Systems Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are widely regarded as a cornerstone of the emerging low-altitude economy, yet they face significant challenges, including rapidly varying channels, diverse functional requirements, and dynamic interference environments. Fluid antenna (FA) systems introduce spatial reconfigurability that complements and extends conventional beamforming, enabling flexible exploitation of spatial diversity and adaptive response to channel variations. This paper proposes a novel architecture for FA-empowered LAWNs and presents a case study demonstrating substantial improvements in communication, sensing, and control performance compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Key practical deployment considerations are examined, including mechanical design, position control, energy efficiency, and compliance with emerging industry standards. In addition, several future research directions are highlighted, including intelligent optimization, multi-function integration, and the exploration of novel low-altitude applications. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical deployment perspectives, this paper establishes FA systems as a key enabler for adaptive, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures in next-generation LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Fractional Reasoning via Latent Steering Vectors Improves Inference Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>
