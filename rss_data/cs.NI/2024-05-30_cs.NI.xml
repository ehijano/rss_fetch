      <title>RANFusion: A Comprehensive Tool for Simulating Handover In Next-G RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of 5G networks and the upcoming transition to 6G necessitate the use of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enable greater flexibility, interoperability, and innovation. This shift towards 6G and O-RAN requires the development of advanced simulation tools for testing, analyzing, and optimizing Radio Access Network (RAN) operations. This need becomes critical due to the complex dynamics of mobility management inherent in the 6G vision and next-generation networks. These networks anticipate advanced handover methods for mobile users, UAVs, IoT devices, and beyond. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces RANFusion: a robust RAN simulator specifically created to explore a variety of handover scenarios and to test and balance resources between users. This tool enables precise simulations for refining handover strategies within RAN and O-RAN environments, thereby ensuring optimal performance and reliability in these advanced network infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Data Service Maximization in Integrated Terrestrial-Non-Terrestrial 6G Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks has emerged as a promising paradigm to fulfill the constantly growing demand for connectivity, low transmission delay, and quality of services (QoS). This integration brings together the strengths of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, such as the reliability of terrestrial networks, broad coverage, and service continuity of non-terrestrial networks like low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. In this work, we study a data service maximization problem in an integrated terrestrial-non-terrestrial network (I-TNT) where the ground base stations (GBSs) and LEO satellites cooperatively serve the coexisting aerial users (AUs) and ground users (GUs). Then, by considering the spectrum scarcity, interference, and QoS requirements of the users, we jointly optimize the user association, AUE's trajectory, and power allocation. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we disintegrate it into two subproblems: 1) user association problem and 2) trajectory and power allocation problem. Since the user association problem is a binary integer programming problem, we use the standard convex optimization method to solve it. Meanwhile, the trajectory and power allocation problem is solved by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to cope with the problem's non-convexity and dynamic network environments. Then, the two subproblems are alternately solved by the proposed iterative algorithm. By comparing with the baselines in the existing literature, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Multi-resolution Model Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning, a server must periodically broadcast a model to the agents. We propose to use multi-resolution coding and modulation (also known as non-uniform modulation) for this purpose. In the simplest instance, broadcast transmission is used, whereby all agents are targeted with one and the same transmission (typically without any particular favored beam direction), which is coded using multi-resolution coding/modulation. This enables high-SNR agents, with high path gains to the server, to receive a more accurate model than the low-SNR agents do, without consuming more downlink resources. As one implementation, we use transmission with a non-uniform 8-PSK constellation, where a high-SNR receiver (agent) can separate all 8 constellation points (hence receive 3 bits) whereas a low-SNR receiver can only separate 4 points (hence receive 2 bits). By encoding the least significant information in the third bit, the high-SNR receivers can obtain the model with higher accuracy, while the low-SNR receiver can still obtain the model although with reduced accuracy, thereby facilitating at least some basic participation of the low-SNR receiver. We show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme via experimentation using federated learning with the MNIST data-set.</description>

      <title>Applications of Generative AI (GAI) for Mobile and Wireless Networking: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in multiple disciplines and vertical domains in recent years has promoted the evolution of mobile networking and the future Internet toward an AI-integrated Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). To bypass this circumvent, Generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of the applications of GAI in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature. Finally, this work summarizes the current research on GAI for mobile and wireless networking by outlining important challenges that need to be resolved to facilitate the development and applicability of GAI in this edge-cutting area.</description>

      <title>Promptus: Can Prompts Streaming Replace Video Streaming with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of video traffic, traditional video streaming systems are approaching their limits in compression efficiency and communication capacity. To further reduce bitrate while maintaining quality, we propose Promptus, a disruptive novel system that streaming prompts instead of video content with Stable Diffusion, which converts video frames into a series of "prompts" for delivery. To ensure pixel alignment, a gradient descent-based prompt fitting framework is proposed. To achieve adaptive bitrate for prompts, a low-rank decomposition-based bitrate control algorithm is introduced. For inter-frame compression of prompts, a temporal smoothing-based prompt interpolation algorithm is proposed. Evaluations across various video domains and real network traces demonstrate Promptus can enhance the perceptual quality by 0.111 and 0.092 (in LPIPS) compared to VAE and H.265, respectively, and decreases the ratio of severely distorted frames by 89.3% and 91.7%. Moreover, Promptus achieves real-time video generation from prompts at over 150 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, Promptus is the first attempt to replace video codecs with prompt inversion and the first to use prompt streaming instead of video streaming. Our work opens up a new paradigm for efficient video communication beyond the Shannon limit.</description>

      <title>Obtaining physical layer data of latest generation networks for investigating adversary attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of machine learning is developing rapidly and is being used in various fields of science and technology. In this way, machine learning can be used to optimize the functions of latest generation data networks such as 5G and 6G. This also applies to functions at a lower level. A feature of the use of machine learning in the radio path for targeted radiation generation in modern ultra-massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent interfaces and other technologies is the complex acquisition and processing of data from the physical layer. Additionally, adversarial measures that manipulate the behaviour of intelligent machine learning models are becoming a major concern, as many machine learning models are sensitive to incorrect input data. To obtain data on attacks directly from processing service information, a simulation model is proposed that works in conjunction with machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Guardians of DNS Integrity: A Remote Method for Identifying DNSSEC Validators Across the Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide the most effective way to fight DNS cache poisoning attacks. Yet, very few DNS resolvers perform DNSSEC validation. Identifying such systems is non-trivial and the existing methods are not suitable for Internet-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel remote technique for identifying DNSSEC-validating resolvers. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify open resolvers by scanning 3.1 billion end hosts and request every non-forwarder to resolve one correct and seven deliberately misconfigured domains. We then build a classifier that discriminates validators from non-validators based on query patterns and DNS response codes. We find that while most open resolvers are DNSSEC-enabled, less than 18% in IPv4 (38% in IPv6) validate received responses. In the second step, we remotely identify closed non-forwarders in networks that do not have inbound Source Address Validation (SAV) in place. Using the classifier built in step one, we identify 37.4% IPv4 (42.9% IPv6) closed DNSSEC validators and cross-validate the results using RIPE Atlas probes. Finally, we show that the discovered (non)-validators actively send requests to DNS root servers, suggesting that we deal with operational recursive resolvers rather than misconfigured machines.</description>

      <title>Don't Get Hijacked: Prevalence, Mitigation, and Impact of Non-Secure DNS Dynamic Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNS dynamic updates represent an inherently vulnerable mechanism deliberately granting the potential for any host to dynamically modify DNS zone files. Consequently, this feature exposes domains to various security risks such as domain hijacking, compromise of domain control validation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Originally devised without the implementation of authentication mechanisms, non-secure DNS updates were widely adopted in DNS software, subsequently leaving domains susceptible to a novel form of attack termed zone poisoning. In order to gauge the extent of this issue, our analysis encompassed over 353 million domain names, revealing the presence of 381,965 domains that openly accepted unsolicited DNS updates. We then undertook a comprehensive three-phase campaign involving the notification of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). Following extensive discussions spanning six months, we observed substantial remediation, with nearly 54\% of nameservers and 98% of vulnerable domains addressing the issue. This outcome serves as evidence that engaging with CSIRTs can prove to be an effective approach for reporting security vulnerabilities. Moreover, our notifications had a lasting impact, as evidenced by the sustained low prevalence of vulnerable domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Offloading via Graph Neural Networks in Heterogeneous Multi-access Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Heterogeneous Multi-access Edge Computing (HMEC), efficient task offloading plays a pivotal role in optimizing system throughput and resource utilization. However, existing task offloading methods often fall short of adequately modeling the dependency topology relationships between offloaded tasks, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the complex interdependencies of task features. To address this limitation, we propose a task offloading mechanism based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our modeling approach takes into account factors such as task characteristics, network conditions, and available resources at the edge, and embeds these captured features into the graph structure. By utilizing GNNs, our mechanism can capture and analyze the intricate relationships between task features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying dependency topology. Through extensive evaluations in heterogeneous networks, our proposed algorithm improves 18.6\%-53.8\% over greedy and approximate algorithms in optimizing system throughput and resource utilization. Our experiments showcase the advantage of considering the intricate interplay of task features using GNN-based modeling.</description>

      <title>OREO: O-RAN intElligence Orchestration of xApp-based network services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture aims to support a plethora of network services, such as beam management and network slicing, through the use of third-party applications called xApps. To efficiently provide network services at the radio interface, it is thus essential that the deployment of the xApps is carefully orchestrated. In this paper, we introduce OREO, an O-RAN xApp orchestrator, designed to maximize the offered services. OREO's key idea is that services can share xApps whenever they correspond to semantically equivalent functions, and the xApp output is of sufficient quality to fulfill the service requirements. By leveraging a multi-layer graph model that captures all the system components, from services to xApps, OREO implements an algorithmic solution that selects the best service configuration, maximizes the number of shared xApps, and efficiently and dynamically allocates resources to them. Numerical results as well as experimental tests performed using our proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrate that OREO closely matches the optimum, obtained by solving an NP-hard problem. Further, it outperforms the state of the art, deploying up to 35% more services with an average of 30% fewer xApps and a similar reduction in the resource consumption.</description>

      <title>To RL or not to RL? An Algorithmic Cheat-Sheet for AI-Based Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several Radio Resource Management (RRM) use cases can be framed as sequential decision planning problems, where an agent (the base station, typically) makes decisions that influence the network utility and state. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) in its general form can address this scenario, it is known to be sample inefficient. Following the principle of Occam's razor, we argue that the choice of the solution technique for RRM should be guided by questions such as, "Is it a short or long-term planning problem?", "Is the underlying model known or does it need to be learned?", "Can we solve the problem analytically?" or "Is an expert-designed policy available?". A wide range of techniques exists to address these questions, including static and stochastic optimization, bandits, model predictive control (MPC) and, indeed, RL. We review some of these techniques that have already been successfully applied to RRM, and we believe that others, such as MPC, may present exciting research opportunities for the future.</description>
