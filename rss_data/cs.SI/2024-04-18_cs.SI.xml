      <title>Graph Vertex Embeddings: Distance, Regularization and Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing complex network structures in a low-dimensional space, enabling the use of efficient methods that employ the metric structure in the embedding space as a proxy for the topological structure of the data. In this paper, we explore several aspects that affect the quality of a vertex embedding of graph-structured data. To this effect, we first present a family of flexible distance functions that faithfully capture the topological distance between different vertices. Secondly, we analyze vertex embeddings as resulting from a fitted transformation of the distance matrix rather than as a direct result of optimization. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding constructions by performing community detection on a host of benchmark datasets. The reported results are competitive with classical algorithms that operate on the entire graph while benefitting from a substantially reduced computational complexity due to the reduced dimensionality of the representations.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Message Behavioral Identification System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On social media platforms, the act of predicting reposting is seen as a challenging issue related to Short Message Services (SMS). This study examines the issue of predicting picture reposting in SMS and forecasts users' behavior in sharing photographs on Twitter. Several research vary. The paper introduces a network called Image Retweet Modeling (IRM) that models heterogeneous image retransmission. It considers the user's previous reposting of the image tweet, the next contact in the SMS, and the preferences of the reposted person. Three aspects connected to content. A text-guided multimodal neural network is developed to create a novel multi-faceted attention ranking network methodology. This allows for learning the joint image Twitter representation and user preference representation in the prediction job. Multiple experiments conducted on extensive data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current methods on Social Network platforms.</description>

      <title>The Future of Research on Social Technologies: CCC Workshop Visioning Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social technologies are the systems, interfaces, features, infrastructures, and architectures that allow people to interact with each other online. These technologies dramatically shape the fabric of our everyday lives, from the information we consume to the people we interact with to the foundations of our culture and politics. While the benefits of social technologies are well documented, the harms, too, have cast a long shadow. To address widespread problems like harassment, disinformation, information access, and mental health concerns, we need to rethink the foundations of how social technologies are designed, sustained, and governed.
  This report is based on discussions at the Computing Community Consortium Workshop, The Future of Research on Social Technologies, that was held November 2-3, 2023 in Washington, DC. The visioning workshop came together to focus on two questions. What should we know about social technologies, and what is needed to get there? The workshop brought together over 50 information and computer scientists, social scientists, communication and journalism scholars, and policy experts. We used a discussion format, with one day of guiding topics and a second day using an unconference model where participants created discussion topics. The interdisciplinary group of attendees discussed gaps in existing scholarship and the methods, resources, access, and collective effort needed to address those gaps. We also discussed approaches for translating scholarship for various audiences including citizens, funders, educators, industry professionals, and policymakers.
  This report presents a synthesis of major themes during our discussions. The themes presented are not a summary of what we know already, they are an exploration of what we do not know enough about, and what we should spend more effort and investment on in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Complex hypergraph analysis of Australian MPs' professional connections, 1947-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a suit of methods to analyse the professional networks of MPs, showing how to analyse weak-tie connections between legislators and the connections between background charactersitic attributes. Applied to a novel dataset on the backgrounds of Australian MPs in the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia (1947-2019), we show that our approach can help to describe and explain the decline in working-class and trade unionist MPs from the Labor Party, the homogeneous elitism of the mid-20 century Liberal Party, and the increasing similarity of both parties' professional networks, occuring in the period of party cartellisation from the 1980s onward. Our paper's finding show that our method has clear potential for broader applications in the study of political representation, diversity, and elite political networks.</description>

      <title>X-posing Free Speech: Examining the Impact of Moderation Relaxation on Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of free speech and the relaxation of moderation on online social media platforms using Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter as a case study. By curating a dataset of over 10 million tweets, our study employs a novel framework combining content and network analysis. Our findings reveal a significant increase in the distribution of certain forms of hate content, particularly targeting the LGBTQ+ community and liberals. Network analysis reveals the formation of cohesive hate communities facilitated by influential bridge users, with substantial growth in interactions hinting at increased hate production and diffusion. By tracking the temporal evolution of PageRank, we identify key influencers, primarily self-identified far-right supporters disseminating hate against liberals and woke culture. Ironically, embracing free speech principles appears to have enabled hate speech against the very concept of freedom of expression and free speech itself. Our findings underscore the delicate balance platforms must strike between open expression and robust moderation to curb the proliferation of hate online.</description>

      <title>CORE: Data Augmentation for Link Prediction via Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is a fundamental task in graph representation learning, with numerous applications in diverse domains. However, the generalizability of LP models is often compromised due to the presence of noisy or spurious information in graphs and the inherent incompleteness of graph data. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the Information Bottleneck principle and propose a novel data augmentation method, COmplete and REduce (CORE) to learn compact and predictive augmentations for LP models. In particular, CORE aims to recover missing edges in graphs while simultaneously removing noise from the graph structures, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the applicability and superiority of CORE over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential as a leading approach for robust LP in graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>IsamasRed: A Public Dataset Tracking Reddit Discussions on Israel-Hamas Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conflict between Israel and Palestinians significantly escalated after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, capturing global attention. To understand the public discourse on this conflict, we present a meticulously compiled dataset-IsamasRed-comprising nearly 400,000 conversations and over 8 million comments from Reddit, spanning from August 2023 to November 2023. We introduce an innovative keyword extraction framework leveraging a large language model to effectively identify pertinent keywords, ensuring a comprehensive data collection. Our initial analysis on the dataset, examining topics, controversy, emotional and moral language trends over time, highlights the emotionally charged and complex nature of the discourse. This dataset aims to enrich the understanding of online discussions, shedding light on the complex interplay between ideology, sentiment, and community engagement in digital spaces.</description>

      <title>A Text Classification Framework for Simple and Effective Early Depression Detection Over Social Media Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.08772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which people's lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However, most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects. SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model on the CLEF's eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection. Most of the 30 contributions submitted to this competition used state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our classifier was able to outperform these models and standard classifiers, despite being less computationally expensive and having the ability to explain its rationale.</description>

      <title>CPL-NoViD: Context-Aware Prompt-based Learning for Norm Violation Detection in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting norm violations in online communities is critical to maintaining healthy and safe spaces for online discussions. Existing machine learning approaches often struggle to adapt to the diverse rules and interpretations across different communities due to the inherent challenges of fine-tuning models for such context-specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce Context-aware Prompt-based Learning for Norm Violation Detection (CPL-NoViD), a novel method that employs prompt-based learning to detect norm violations across various types of rules. CPL-NoViD outperforms the baseline by incorporating context through natural language prompts and demonstrates improved performance across different rule types. Significantly, it not only excels in cross-rule-type and cross-community norm violation detection but also exhibits adaptability in few-shot learning scenarios. Most notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art in norm violation detection, surpassing existing benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of prompt-based learning for context-sensitive norm violation detection and paves the way for future research on more adaptable, context-aware models to better support online community moderators.</description>

      <title>An entropy-based measurement for understanding origin-destination trip distributions: a case study of New York City taxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of human mobility patterns in urban areas is essential for urban development and transportation planning. In this study, we create entropy-based measurements to capture the geographical distribution diversity of trip origins and destinations. Specifically, we develop origin-entropy and destination-entropy based on taxi and ride-sharing trip records. The origin-entropy for a given zone accounts for all the trips that originate from this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips destinations. Likewise, the destination-entropy for a given zone considers all the trips that end in this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips origins. Furthermore, we have created an interactive geovisualization that enables researchers to delve into and juxtapose the spatial and temporal dynamics of origin and destination entropy, in conjunction with trip counts for both origins and destinations. Results indicate that entropy-based measurements effectively capture shifts in the diversity of trips geographical origins and destinations, reflecting changes in travel decisions due to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic. These measurements, alongside trip counts, offer a more comprehensive understanding of urban human flows.</description>

      <title>HateCOT: An Explanation-Enhanced Dataset for Generalizable Offensive Speech Detection via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitousness of social media has led to the need for reliable and efficient detection of offensive content to limit harmful effects. This has led to a proliferation of datasets and models related to detecting offensive content. While sophisticated models have attained strong performance on individual datasets, these models often do not generalize due to differences between how "offensive content" is conceptualized, and the resulting differences in how these datasets are labeled. In this paper, we introduce HateCOT, a dataset of 52,000 samples drawn from diverse existing sources with explanations generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo and human-curated. We show that pre-training models for the detection of offensive content on HateCOT significantly boots open-sourced Language Models on three benchmark datasets in both zero and few-shot settings, despite differences in domain and task.} We further find that HateCOT enables effective K-shot fine-tuning in the low-resource settings.</description>
