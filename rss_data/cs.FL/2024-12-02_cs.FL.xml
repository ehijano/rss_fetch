      <title>Classical and Quantum Algorithms for the Deterministic L-system Inductive Inference Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a hugely time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</description>

Abstract: We study Ramsey like theorems for infinite trees and similar combinatorial tools. As an application we consider the expansion problem for tree algebras.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Process Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer science theory provides many different measures of complexity of a system including Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, computational depth, and Levin complexity. However, these measures are all defined only for deterministic Turing machines, i.e., deterministic dynamics of the underlying generative process whose output we are interested in. Therefore, by construction they cannot capture complexity of the output of stochastic processes - like those in the real world. Motivated by this observation, we combine probabilistic Turing machines with a prior over the inputs to the Turing machine to define a complete stochastic process of Turing machines. We call this a stochastic process Turing machine. We use stochastic process Turing machines to define a set of new generative complexity measures based on Turing machines, which we call stochastic depth. As we discuss, stochastic depth is related to other such measures including Kolmogorov complexity and Levin complexity. However, as we elaborate, it has many desirable properties that those others measures lack. In addition, stochastic depth is closely related to various thermodynamic properties of computational systems. Stochastic process Turing machines and stochastic depth allow us to study complex, stochastic systems like the human brain, societies, and evolution all from within the framework of formal computation.</description>
