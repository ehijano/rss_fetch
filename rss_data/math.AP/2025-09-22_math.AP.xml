      <title>Construction of multi-solitary waves solution to the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation outside an obstacle in the $L^2$-subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing $L^2$-subcritical Schr\"odinger equation in the exterior of a smooth, compact, strictly convex obstacle $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We construct a solution that, for large times, behaves asymptotically as a finite sum of solitary waves on $\mathbb{R}^d$, each traveling with sufficiently large and distinct velocities, and satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. The construction is achieved via a compactness argument similar to that introduced by F.Merle in 1990 for constructing solutions of the NLS equation that blow up at several points, combined with modulation theory, the coercivity property of the linearized operator, and localized energy estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global existence of component-wise nonnegative solutions of the Gray-Scott model in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 1$, with a mixture of both local and nonlocal diffusion operators.

      <title>Global Existence of Solutions of Nonlocal Geirer-Meinhardt Model and Effect of Nonlocal Operator in Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global existence of solutions to a class of nonlocal Geirer-Meinhardt system. This is a two component reaction-diffusion model on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 1$, with nonlocal diffusion given by a nonlocal convolution operator. We have used semigroup theory and derive estimate to guarantee global existence. Then we build an $L^b$ functional to bound our solution independent of the nonlocal convolution kernel for $2 \le b &lt; \infty$. Next, we have used this result to obtain a diffusive limit similar to \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal} for our model. We also numerically simulate our model to show the formation of patterns by this model and compare the results with the patterns with the traditional local/classical Geirer-Meinhardt model.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and Gevrey regularity of Navier-Stokes equations in critical Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations, including well-posedness and Gevrey regularity, are a class of highly interesting problems. Inspired by the property of Lorentz type spaces that they reflect the distribution of large value points, we establish the global well-posedness of Navier-Stokes equations in critical Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz space. Based on this, we obtained the Gevrey regularity of the mild solution. Compared with Germain-Pavlovi\'c-Staffilani (2007), the Gevrey regularity we studied is stronger than analyticity. Furthermore, regarding that previous regularity studies mostly focused on Besov spaces, such as Liu-Zhang (2024),our Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces contain more general initial value spaces, including part of Besov spaces and all of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, etc..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with a Brezis-Nirenberg type problem for a critical Choquard equation, in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, and with the Hardy potential in a smooth bounded domain. By exploiting variational methods we obtain existence results, which extend to different perturbation terms. Some estimates of independent interest about a nonlocal minimization problem are also derived.</description>

      <title>Phase separation for the 2D Cahn-Hilliard equation with a background shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which models phase separation in binary fluids, on the two-dimen\-sional torus in the presence of advection by a given background shear flow, satisfying certain conditions and of sufficiently large amplitude. By exploiting the resulting enhanced dissipation for the linearized operator, we prove that, with well-prepared data, the solution converges asymptotically at large times to the solution of a one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation, obtained by projecting the full equation in the direction orthogonal to the shear in a suitable sense. This result rigorously justified the observed phenomenon of striation in the concentration field.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneous recovery of boundary impedance and internal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an inverse problem of the simultaneous recovery of boundary impedance and internal conductivity in the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) model using local internal measurement data, which is governed by a boundary value problem for an elliptic equation in divergence form with Robin boundary condition. We firstly express the solution to the forward problem by volume and surface potentials in terms of the Levi function. Then, for the inverse problem, we prove the uniqueness of the solution in an admissible set by unique extension of the solution under some {a-prior} assumption. Finally we establish the regularizing reconstruction schemes for boundary impedance and internal conductivity using noisy measurement data with rigorous error estimates. The mollification method is proposed to recover the boundary impedance from the boundary condition, and the internal conductivity with known boundary value is recovered from an integral system, where the Tikhonov regularization is applied to seek the stable solution, considering that the error involved in the boundary impedance coefficient reconstruction will propagate to the recovering process for internal conductivity. Numerical implementations are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On traveling wave solutions of water-wave equations in curved annular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering investigation into the existence of traveling wave solutions for the two-dimensional Euler equations with constant vorticity in a curved annular domain, where gravity acts radially inward. This configuration is highly relevant to astrophysical and equatorial oceanic flows, such as those found in planetary rings and equatorial currents. Unlike traditional water wave models that assume flat beds and vertical gravity, our study more accurately captures the centripetal effects and boundary-driven vorticity inherent in these complex systems.
  Our main results establish both local and global bifurcation of traveling waves, marking a significant advancement in the field. First, through a local bifurcation analysis near a trivial solution, we identify a critical parameter \(\alpha_c\) and prove the existence of a smooth branch of small-amplitude solutions. The bifurcation is shown to be pitchfork-type, with its direction (subcritical or supercritical) determined by the sign of an explicit parameter \(\mathcal{O}\). This finding provides a nuanced understanding of the wave behavior under varying conditions. Second, we obtain a global bifurcation result using a modified Leray-Schauder degree theory. This result demonstrates that the local branch extends to large-amplitude waves. This comprehensive analysis offers a holistic view of the traveling wave solutions in this complex domain. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the theoretical bifurcation types, confirming both supercritical and subcritical regimes. These examples highlight the practical applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>On completeness of modified wave operators for defocusing NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study modified scattering for the nonlinear defocusing Schr\"odinger equation with a critical gauge-invariant nonlinearity of order 1+2/n.
  We address the following question: Given initial data in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, what is the leading term in the asymptotic behavior of the solution as times goes to infinity? More precisely, we seek a final state in a space of type similar to the space of the initial data such that the leading term is represented by the free propagator and modified phase function.
  The solution to this problem can be reformulated in terms of the completeness of wave operators. For n=1, we obtain a complete answer, even for large initial data. For n = 2 completeness is established assuming suitable control of the sup norm of the solution.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of inverse random source problems for stochastic heat and wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse random source problem for stochastic evolution equations, including stochastic heat and wave equations, with the unknown source modeled as $g(x)f(t)\dot{W}(t)$. The research commences with the establishment of the well-posedness of the corresponding stochastic direct problem. Under suitable regularity conditions, the existence of stochastic strong solutions for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is demonstrated. For the inverse problem, the objective is to uniquely recover the strength $|f(t)|$ of the time-dependent component of the source from the boundary flux on a nonempty open subset. The uniqueness of the recovery for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is proven, and several numerical examples are given to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Solving for Symmetry-Driven PDE dynamics with Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, we have presented a systematic computational framework for analyzing self-similar and traveling wave dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by dynamically factoring out continuous symmetries such as translation and scaling. This is achieved through the use of time-dependent transformations -- what can be viewed as dynamic pinning conditions -- that render the symmetry-invariant solution stationary or slowly varying in rescaled coordinates. The transformation process yields a modified evolution equation coupled with algebraic constraints on the symmetry parameters, resulting in index-2 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The framework accommodates both first-kind and second-kind self-similarity, and directly recovers the self-similarity exponents or wave speeds as part of the solution, upon considering steady-state solutions in the rescaled coordinate frame. To solve the resulting high-index DAE systems, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which naturally integrate PDE residuals and algebraic constraints into a unified loss function. This allows simultaneous inference of both the invariant solution and the transformation properties (such as the speed or the scaling rate without the need for large computational domains, mesh adaptivity, or front tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on four canonical problems: (i) the Nagumo equation exhibiting traveling waves, (ii) the diffusion equation (1D and 2D) with first-kind self-similarity, (iii) the 2D axisymmetric porous medium equation showcasing second-kind self-similarity, and (iv) the Burgers equation, which involves both translational and scaling invariance. The results demonstrate the capability of PINNs to effectively solve these complex PDE-DAE systems, providing a promising tool for studying nonlinear wave and scaling phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study regularity properties of a class of subelliptic evolution operators. We first prove the existence of the fundamental solution by means of Levi's parametrix method, establishing also several key properties. We then employ these results, together with some mean value formulas, to prove a maximum principle and an invariant Harnack inequality for the classical solutions to the equations under study. Our analysis critically relies on the Carnot Caratheodory geometry naturally induced by the vector fields defining these operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractional $(p,q)$-Laplace equation $$ (-\Delta_p)^s u +(-\Delta_q)^t u= 0 $$ for $s,t\in(0,1)$ and $p,q\in(1,\infty)$. We establish H\"older estimates with an explicit exponent. As a consequence, we derive a Liouville-type theorem. Our approach builds on techniques previously developed for the fractional $p$-Laplace equation, relying on a Moser-type iteration for difference quotients.</description>

      <title>Viscosity and minimax solutions for path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions and related differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new results for path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations with nonlinear monotone, and coercive operators on Hilbert space, which were initially studied in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (8) (2018), pp. 2096-2161]. Under more general assumptions than in the cited paper (and more general than in the finite-dimensional case as well), we prove the uniqueness of a minimax solution of a terminal-value problem for the equation under consideration and the existence of such a solution on the whole path space. We introduce a new notion of a viscosity solution for this problem and show the equivalence of this notion to the notion of a minimax solution, which implies the corresponding existence and uniqueness theorem for viscosity solutions. In addition, we obtain a stability result for viscosity solutions using the half-relaxed limits method. As applications, we prove two theorems on the existence and characterization of value of a zero-sum differential game for a time-delay (path-dependent) evolution equation. The first theorem pertains to the case of non-anticipative (Elliott-Kalton) strategies and is related to the results on viscosity solutions, and the second theorem deals with the case of feedback (Krasovskii-Subbotin) strategies and is based on the results on minimax solutions.</description>

      <title>On Tent Spaces for the Gaussian Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the scheme of tent spaces in classical harmonic analysis developed by R. Coifman, Y. Meyer, and E. Stein in \cite{cms}, we succeed in doing so for the Gaussian setting. In \cite{MNP}, part of this theory (an atomic decomposition) is developed for a specific tent space where functions are defined just in a proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+,$ and without the use of an area function. In the present paper, using a variation of the area function considered in \cite{FSU}, we define the Gaussian area function and Gaussian tent spaces and prove both their atomic decompositions and the characterization of their dual spaces. Some applications are also considered.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit for the cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic limit for the cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger model as the size of the domain tends to infinity with fixed density $\rho:= N/|\mathcal{D}|$, where $N$ denotes particle number and $|\mathcal{D}|$ denotes the volume of the bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$). For density satisfying \(0&lt;\rho\leq 3/4\), we prove that the thermodynamic limit of the ground state energy for the cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger model exists, and is actually equal to the corresponding Thomas-Fermi ground state energy. Further more, when \(\mathcal{D}\) is a spherical domain, we prove that, up to a scaling, the ground state minimizer of the cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger energy will converges to a Thomas-Fermi minimizer strongly in $L^2\cap L^6$, and then we obtain the $L^\infty$-convergence rate by developing a novel energy method, which may be applicable to other general nonlinearities. As a by-product, we study the Thomas-Fermi limit for this model in the whole space \(\mathbb{R}^d\) as the particle number \(N\) tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the general $Q$-tensor model interacting with a rigid body</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the fluid-rigid body interaction problem of nematic liquid crystals described by the general Beris-Edwards $Q$-tensor model is studied. It is proved first that the total energy of this problem decreases in time. The associated mathematical problem is a quasilinear mixed-order system with moving boundary. After the transformation to a fixed domain, a monolithic approach based on the added mass operator and lifting arguments is employed to establish the maximal $L^p$-regularity of the linearized problem in an anisotropic ground space. This paves the way for the local strong well-posedness for large data and global strong well-posedness for small data of the interaction problem.</description>

      <title>The Korteweg-de Vries Equation on general star graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem associated with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on a general metric star graph. The graph comprises m + k semi-infinite edges: k negative half-lines and m positive half-lines, all joined at a common vertex. The choice of boundary conditions is compatible with the conditions determined by the semigroup theory. The crucial point in this work is to obtain the integral formula using the forcing operator method and the Fourier restriction method of Bourgain. This work extends the results obtained by Cavalcante for the specific case of the Y junction to a more general class of star graphs.</description>

      <title>Compactness and non-compactness theorems of the fourth- and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of compactness for the full solution sets of the fourth-order and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems on smooth closed Riemannian manifolds not conformally diffeomorphic to the standard unit $n$-sphere, provided the associated conformally covariant differential operator has a positive Green's function.
  Firstly, we prove that the solution set of the fourth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^4$-compact in dimensions $5 \le n \le 24$. For $n \ge 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions has been known for over a decade (Wei and Zhao). Additionally, the compactness result for $5 \le n \le 9$ was established by Li and Xiong.
  Secondly, we demonstrate that the solution set of the sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^6$-compact in dimensions $7 \le n \le 26$, whereas a blow-up example exists for $n \ge 27$.
  Our main observation is that the linearized equations associated with both $Q$-curvature problems can be transformed into overdetermined linear systems, which admit nontrivial solutions due to unexpected algebraic structures of the Paneitz operator and the sixth-order GJMS operator. This key insight not only plays a crucial role in deducing the compactness result for high-dimensional manifolds, but also reveals an elegant hierarchical pattern with respect to the order of the conformally covariant operators, suggesting the possibility of a unified theory of the compactness of the constant $Q$-curvature problems of all admissible even integer orders.</description>

      <title>A $\mathcal C^\infty$-structure-based approach to traveling wave solutions of the gKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel geometric method is applied to the problem of describing traveling wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation in the form $$ u_t + u_{xxx} + a(u)u_x = 0, $$ where $a(u)$ is a smooth function characterizing the nonlinearity. Using the traveling wave ansatz, the gKdV equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which we analyze via the $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure-based method, a geometric framework involving sequences of involutive distributions and Pfaffian equations. Starting with the symmetry $\partial_z$, we construct a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure for the ODE and apply the stepwise integration algorithm to obtain an implicit general solution. Then we derive explicit solutions for specific forms of $a(u)$, including the modified KdV and Schamel--KdV equations, as well as power-law nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>On a fractional semilinear Neumann problem arising in Chemotaxis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a semilinear and nonlocal Neumann problem, which is the fractional analogue of the problem considered by Lin--Ni--Takagi in the '80s. The model under consideration arises in the description of stationary configurations of the Keller--Segel model for chemotaxis, when a nonlocal diffusion for the concentration of the chemical is considered. In particular, we extend to any fractional power $s\in (0,1)$ of the Laplacian (with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions) the results obtained in [20] for $s=1/2$. We prove existence and some qualitative properties of non--constant solutions when the diffusion parameter $\varepsilon$ is small enough, and on the other hand, we show that for $\varepsilon$ large enough any solution must be necessarily constant.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we deal with the initial value problem related to a family of dispersive inhomogeneous evolution equations Pu=f with variable coefficients belonging to the class of p-evolution equations, $p\geq 2$. We study the smoothing effect produced by some spatial decay assumptions on the imaginary part of the subleading coefficient of the linear operator P. Then we apply this result to nonlinear problems with derivative nonlinearities obtaining existence and uniqueness of the solution in a suitable Sobolev class. The nonlinear equations considered include various equations of physical interest such as KdV-type and Kawahara-type equations.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of strong solution to the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system</title>

Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with an initial-boundary value problem of the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with the Landau potential in a two and three dimensions. The existence of strong solutions with bounded and strictly positive density for this system was constructed by Giorgini and Temam \cite{GT}. However, whether uniqueness holds has remained an open question. The present work solves this question and we prove the uniqueness of strong solution. Our method mainly relies on some extra time weighted estimates and the Lagrangian approach.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this paper we introduce the space of bounded deformation fields with generalized Orlicz growth. We establish their main properties, provide a modular representation, and characterize a decomposition of the modular into an absolutely continuous part and a singular part weighted via a recession function. A further analysis in the variable exponent case is also provided. The second part of the paper contains a notion of Musielak-Orlicz anisotropic Total Generalized Variation. We establish a duality representation, and show well-posedness of the corresponding image reconstruction problem.</description>

      <title>Random data Cauchy theory for fully nonlocal telegraph equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the random Cauchy problem for the fully nonlocal telegraph equation of power type with the general $(\mathcal{PC}^{\ast})$ type kernel $(a,b)$. This equation can effectively characterize high-frequency signal transmission in small-scale systems. We establish a new completely positive kernel induced by $b$ (see Appendix \refeq{app b}) and derive two novel solution operators by using the relaxation functions associated with the new kernel,which are closely related to the operators $\cos(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ and $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{\beta}{4} }\sin(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ for $\beta\in(1,2]$. These operators enable, for the first time, the derivation of mixed-norm $L_t^qL_x^{p'}$ estimates for the novel solution operators. Next, utilizing probabilistic randomization methods, we establish the average effects, the local existence and uniqueness for a large set of initial data $u^\omega \in L^{2}(\Omega, H^{s,p}(\mathbb R^3))$ ($p\in (1,2)$) while also obtaining probabilistic estimates for local existence under randomized initial conditions. The results reveal a critical phenomenon in the temporal regularity of the solution regarding the regularity index $s$ of the initial data $u^\omega$.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Ricci flow and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing and recognizing metrics can be extraordinarily difficult because of the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem. The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is "propagation of almost splitting", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on CD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szeg\"o type inequality. We use this rearrangement to prove the validity of a Moser-Trudinger type inequality on a wide class of metric measure spaces satisfying a CD(k,n)-curvature-dimension inequality. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define flat bands in the sense of Floquet-Bloch theory. One puzzling question originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also explains the quantisation condition - both the WKB structure and that rule are confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.</description>
