      <title>End-to-end Triple-domain PET Enhancement: A Hybrid Denoising-and-reconstruction Framework for Reconstructing Standard-dose PET Images from Low-dose PET Sinograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a sensitive functional imaging technique, positron emission tomography (PET) plays a critical role in early disease diagnosis. However, obtaining a high-quality PET image requires injecting a sufficient dose (standard dose) of radionuclides into the body, which inevitably poses radiation hazards to patients. To mitigate radiation hazards, the reconstruction of standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is desired. According to imaging theory, PET reconstruction process involves multiple domains (e.g., projection domain and image domain), and a significant portion of the difference between SPET and LPET arises from variations in the noise levels introduced during the sampling of raw data as sinograms. In light of these two facts, we propose an end-to-end TriPle-domain LPET EnhancemenT (TriPLET) framework, by leveraging the advantages of a hybrid denoising-and-reconstruction process and a triple-domain representation (i.e., sinograms, frequency spectrum maps, and images) to reconstruct SPET images from LPET sinograms. Specifically, TriPLET consists of three sequentially coupled components including 1) a Transformer-assisted denoising network that denoises the inputted LPET sinograms in the projection domain, 2) a discrete-wavelet-transform-based reconstruction network that further reconstructs SPET from LPET in the wavelet domain, and 3) a pair-based adversarial network that evaluates the reconstructed SPET images in the image domain. Extensive experiments on the real PET dataset demonstrate that our proposed TriPLET can reconstruct SPET images with the highest similarity and signal-to-noise ratio to real data, compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>DiffuPT: Class Imbalance Mitigation for Glaucoma Detection via Diffusion Based Generation and Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by structural damage to the optic nerve head and functional changes in the visual field. Detecting glaucoma early is crucial to preventing loss of eyesight. However, medical datasets often suffer from class imbalances, making detection more difficult for deep-learning algorithms. We use a generative-based framework to enhance glaucoma diagnosis, specifically addressing class imbalance through synthetic data generation. In addition, we collected the largest national dataset for glaucoma detection to support our study. The imbalance between normal and glaucomatous cases leads to performance degradation of classifier models. By combining our proposed framework leveraging diffusion models with a pretraining approach, we created a more robust classifier training process. This training process results in a better-performing classifier. The proposed approach shows promising results in improving the harmonic mean (sensitivity and specificity) and AUC for the roc for the glaucoma classifier. We report an improvement in the harmonic mean metric from 89.09% to 92.59% on the test set of our national dataset. We examine our method against other methods to overcome imbalance through extensive experiments. We report similar improvements on the AIROGS dataset. This study highlights that diffusion-based generation can be of great importance in tackling class imbalances in medical datasets to improve diagnostic performance.</description>

      <title>INRetouch: Context Aware Implicit Neural Representation for Photography Retouching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. With the ubiquity of smartphone photography, there is an increasing demand for accessible yet sophisticated image editing solutions. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, requiring no pretraining and capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

      <title>Dual-Branch Subpixel-Guided Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied into hyperspectral image (HSI) classification owing to its promising feature learning and representation capabilities. However, limited by the spatial resolution of sensors, existing DL-based classification approaches mainly focus on pixel-level spectral and spatial information extraction through complex network architecture design, while ignoring the existence of mixed pixels in actual scenarios. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dual-branch subpixel-guided network for HSI classification, called DSNet, which automatically integrates subpixel information and convolutional class features by introducing a deep autoencoder unmixing architecture to enhance classification performance. DSNet is capable of fully considering physically nonlinear properties within subpixels and adaptively generating diagnostic abundances in an unsupervised manner to achieve more reliable decision boundaries for class label distributions. The subpixel fusion module is designed to ensure high-quality information fusion across pixel and subpixel features, further promoting stable joint classification. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DSNet compared with state-of-the-art DL-based HSI classification approaches. The codes will be available at https://github.com/hanzhu97702/DSNet, contributing to the remote sensing community.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Aware Segmentation Network Robust to Motion Artifacts for Brain Tissue Segmentation using Disentanglement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion artifacts caused by prolonged acquisition time are a significant challenge in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), hindering accurate tissue segmentation. These artifacts appear as blurred images that mimic tissue-like appearances, making segmentation difficult. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework that demonstrates superior performance in both motion correction and robust brain tissue segmentation in the presence of artifacts. The core concept lies in a complementary process: a disentanglement learning network progressively removes artifacts, leading to cleaner images and consequently, more accurate segmentation by a jointly trained motion estimation and segmentation network. This network generates three outputs: a motioncorrected image, a motion deformation map that identifies artifact-affected regions, and a brain tissue segmentation mask. This deformation serves as a guidance mechanism for the disentanglement process, aiding the model in recovering lost information or removing artificial structures introduced by the artifacts. Extensive in-vivo experiments on pediatric motion data demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmenting motion-corrupted MRI scans.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Feature-Based Subtyping and Model Ensemble for Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.</description>

      <title>Adult Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa using Transfer Learning on Stratified Finetuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gliomas, a kind of brain tumor characterized by high mortality, present substantial diagnostic challenges in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper introduces a novel approach to glioma segmentation using transfer learning to address challenges in resource-limited regions with minimal and low-quality MRI data. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models, nnU-Net and MedNeXt, and apply a stratified fine-tuning strategy using the BraTS2023-Adult-Glioma and BraTS-Africa datasets. Our method exploits radiomic analysis to create stratified training folds, model training on a large brain tumor dataset, and transfer learning to the Sub-Saharan context. A weighted model ensembling strategy and adaptive post-processing are employed to enhance segmentation accuracy. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen validation cases on the BraTS-Africa 2024 task resulted in lesion-wise mean Dice scores of 0.870, 0.865, and 0.926, for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions and was ranked first for the challenge. Our approach highlights the ability of integrated machine-learning techniques to bridge the gap between the medical imaging capabilities of resource-limited countries and established developed regions. By tailoring our methods to a target population's specific needs and constraints, we aim to enhance diagnostic capabilities in isolated environments. Our findings underscore the importance of approaches like local data integration and stratification refinement to address healthcare disparities, ensure practical applicability, and enhance impact.</description>

      <title>Supertoroid fitting of objects with holes for robotic grasping and scene generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities. Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders, but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to a wider variety of shapes.
  One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole. Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric modeling.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CCA: A Context-Based Approach for Traffic Sign Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic sign detection is crucial for improving road safety and advancing autonomous driving technologies. Due to the complexity of driving environments, traffic sign detection frequently encounters a range of challenges, including low resolution, limited feature information, and small object sizes. These challenges significantly hinder the effective extraction of features from traffic signs, resulting in false positives and false negatives in object detection. To address these challenges, it is essential to explore more efficient and accurate approaches for traffic sign detection. This paper proposes a context-based algorithm for traffic sign detection, which utilizes YOLOv7 as the baseline model. Firstly, we propose an adaptive local context feature enhancement (LCFE) module using multi-scale dilation convolution to capture potential relationships between the object and surrounding areas. This module supplements the network with additional local context information. Secondly, we propose a global context feature collection (GCFC) module to extract key location features from the entire image scene as global context information. Finally, we build a Transformer-based context collection augmentation (CCA) module to process the collected local context and global context, which achieves superior multi-level feature fusion results for YOLOv7 without bringing in additional complexity. Extensive experimental studies performed on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset show that the mAP of our method is 92.1\%. Compared with YOLOv7, our approach improves 3.9\% in mAP, while the amount of parameters is reduced by 2.7M. On the CCTSDB2021 dataset the mAP is improved by 0.9\%. These results show that our approach achieves higher detection accuracy with fewer parameters. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/zippiest/yolo-cca}.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Stylized Image Synthesis for Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning but is often challenged by domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition conditions, and patient-specific attributes. Traditional domain generalization methods typically require inclusion of parts of the test domain within the training set, which is not always feasible in clinical settings with limited diverse data. Additionally, although diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in image generation and style transfer, they often fail to preserve the critical structural information necessary for precise medical analysis. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image segmentation method that combines diffusion models and Structure-Preserving Network for structure-aware one-shot image stylization. Our approach effectively mitigates domain shifts by transforming images from various sources into a consistent style while maintaining the location, size, and shape of lesions. This ensures robust and accurate segmentation even when the target domain is absent from the training data. Experimental evaluations on colonoscopy polyp segmentation and skin lesion segmentation datasets show that our method enhances the robustness and accuracy of segmentation models, achieving superior performance metrics compared to baseline models without style transfer. This structure-aware stylization framework offers a practical solution for improving medical image segmentation across diverse domains, facilitating more reliable clinical diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Single Event Upsets in Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation: an embedded system perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the deployment of artifical intelligence (AI) algorithms at edge devices becomes increasingly prevalent, enhancing the robustness and reliability of autonomous AI-based perception and decision systems is becoming as relevant as precision and performance, especially in applications areas considered safety-critical such as autonomous driving and aerospace. This paper delves into the robustness assessment in embedded Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly focusing on the impact of parameter perturbations produced by single event upsets (SEUs) on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image semantic segmentation. By scrutinizing the layer-by-layer and bit-by-bit sensitivity of various encoder-decoder models to soft errors, this study thoroughly investigates the vulnerability of segmentation DNNs to SEUs and evaluates the consequences of techniques like model pruning and parameter quantization on the robustness of compressed models aimed at embedded implementations. The findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying SEU-induced failures that allow for evaluating the robustness of DNNs once trained in advance. Moreover, based on the collected data, we propose a set of practical lightweight error mitigation techniques with no memory or computational cost suitable for resource-constrained deployments. The code used to perform the fault injection (FI) campaign is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/TensorFI2 , while the code to implement proposed techniques is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/parameterProtection .</description>

      <title>Designing DNNs for a trade-off between robustness and processing performance in embedded devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems employed in safety-critical applications such as aerospace and autonomous driving need to be robust against perturbations produced by soft errors. Soft errors are an increasing concern in modern digital processors since smaller transistor geometries and lower voltages give electronic devices a higher sensitivity to background radiation. The resilience of deep neural network (DNN) models to perturbations in their parameters is determined, to a large extent, by the structure of the model itself, and also by the selected numerical representation and used arithmetic precision. When compression techniques such as model pruning and model quantization are applied to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity for deployment, both model structure and numerical representation are modified and thus, soft error robustness also changes. In this sense, although the choice of activation functions (AFs) in DNN models is frequently ignored, it conditions not only their accuracy and trainability, but also compressibility rates and numerical robustness. This paper investigates the suitability of using bounded AFs to improve model robustness against DNN parameter perturbations, assessing at the same time the impact of this choice on deployment in terms of model accuracy, compressibility, and computational burden. In particular, we analyze encoder-decoder fully convolutional models aimed at performing semantic segmentation tasks on hyperspectral images for scene understanding in autonomous driving. Deployment characterization is performed experimentally on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents, trained with four different reward structures, leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in the test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera-based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating adaptability for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fully Convolutional Networks for the Segmentation of Hyperspectral Imaging Applied to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed with the main purpose of increasing the safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Most of current computer vision-based ADAS perform detection and tracking tasks quite successfully under regular conditions, but are not completely reliable, particularly under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, neither in complex situations with many overlapping objects. In this work we explore the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in ADAS on the assumption that the distinct near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectances of different materials can help to better separate the objects in a driving scene. In particular, this paper describes some experimental results of the application of fully convolutional networks (FCN) to the image segmentation of HSI for ADAS applications. More specifically, our aim is to investigate to what extent the spatial features codified by convolutional filters can be helpful to improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems. With that aim, we use the HSI-Drive v1.1 dataset, which provides a set of labelled images recorded in real driving conditions with a small-size snapshot NIR-HSI camera. Finally, we analyze the implementability of such a HSI segmentation system by prototyping the developed FCN model together with the necessary hyperspectral cube preprocessing stage and characterizing its performance on an MPSoC.</description>

      <title>LaserGuider: A Laser Based Physical Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed hidden associations between triggers and targets in deep neural networks (DNNs), causing them to predict the target when a trigger is present while maintaining normal behavior otherwise. Physical backdoor attacks, which use physical objects as triggers, are feasible but lack remote control, temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a new type of backdoor triggers utilizing lasers that feature long-distance transmission and instant-imaging properties. Based on the laser-based backdoor triggers, we present a physical backdoor attack, called LaserGuider, which possesses remote control ability and achieves high temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. We also introduce a systematic approach to optimize laser parameters for improving attack effectiveness. Our evaluation on traffic sign recognition DNNs, critical in autonomous vehicles, demonstrates that LaserGuider with three different laser-based triggers achieves over 90% attack success rate with negligible impact on normal inputs. Additionally, we release LaserMark, the first dataset of real world traffic signs stamped with physical laser spots, to support further research in backdoor attacks and defenses.</description>

      <title>Blind Underwater Image Restoration using Co-Operational Regressor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of underwater environments is essential for applications such as biological research, archaeology, and infrastructure maintenanceHowever, underwater imaging is challenging due to the waters unique properties, including scattering, absorption, color distortion, and reduced visibility. To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</description>

      <title>Hipandas: Hyperspectral Image Joint Denoising and Super-Resolution by Image Fusion with the Panchromatic Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are frequently noisy and of low resolution due to the constraints of imaging devices. Recently launched satellites can concurrently acquire HSIs and panchromatic (PAN) images, enabling the restoration of HSIs to generate clean and high-resolution imagery through fusing PAN images for denoising and super-resolution. However, previous studies treated these two tasks as independent processes, resulting in accumulated errors. This paper introduces \textbf{H}yperspectral \textbf{I}mage Joint \textbf{Pand}enoising \textbf{a}nd Pan\textbf{s}harpening (Hipandas), a novel learning paradigm that reconstructs HRHS images from noisy low-resolution HSIs (LRHS) and high-resolution PAN images. The proposed zero-shot Hipandas framework consists of a guided denoising network, a guided super-resolution network, and a PAN reconstruction network, utilizing an HSI low-rank prior and a newly introduced detail-oriented low-rank prior. The interconnection of these networks complicates the training process, necessitating a two-stage training strategy to ensure effective training. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms, yielding more accurate and visually pleasing HRHS images.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Limits of Segment Anything Model: Analyzing Challenges in Segmenting Tree-Like and Low-Contrast Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance in interactive and zero-shot segmentation across diverse domains, suggesting that they have learned a general concept of "objects" from their large-scale training. However, we observed that SAM struggles with certain types of objects, particularly those featuring dense, tree-like structures and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are critical for understanding its limitations in real-world use. In order to systematically examine this issue, we propose metrics to quantify two key object characteristics: tree-likeness and textural separability. Through extensive controlled synthetic experiments and testing on real datasets, we demonstrate that SAM's performance is noticeably correlated with these factors. We link these behaviors under the concept of "textural confusion", where SAM misinterprets local structure as global texture, leading to over-segmentation, or struggles to differentiate objects from similarly textured backgrounds. These findings offer the first quantitative framework to model SAM's challenges, providing valuable insights into its limitations and guiding future improvements for vision foundation models.</description>

      <title>Practical Operator Sketching Framework for Accelerating Iterative Data-Driven Solutions in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new operator-sketching paradigm for designing efficient iterative data-driven reconstruction (IDR) schemes, e.g. Plug-and-Play algorithms and deep unrolling networks. These IDR schemes are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks. Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes (Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Image Super-Resolution via Frequency-Aware Inverse-Consistency GAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images, a limited scanning rate leads to a trade-off between field-of-view (FOV) and imaging resolution. Although larger FOV images may reveal more parafoveal vascular lesions, their application is greatly hampered due to lower resolution. To increase the resolution, previous works only achieved satisfactory performance by using paired data for training, but real-world applications are limited by the challenge of collecting large-scale paired images. Thus, an unpaired approach is highly demanded. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been commonly used in the unpaired setting, but it may struggle to accurately preserve fine-grained capillary details, which are critical biomarkers for OCTA. In this paper, our approach aspires to preserve these details by leveraging the frequency information, which represents details as high-frequencies ($\textbf{hf}$) and coarse-grained backgrounds as low-frequencies ($\textbf{lf}$). In general, we propose a GAN-based unpaired super-resolution method for OCTA images and exceptionally emphasize $\textbf{hf}$ fine capillaries through a dual-path generator. To facilitate a precise spectrum of the reconstructed image, we also propose a frequency-aware adversarial loss for the discriminator and introduce a frequency-aware focal consistency loss for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art unpaired methods both quantitatively and visually.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Denoising for Signal-Dependent and Row-Correlated Imaging Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate analysis of microscopy images is hindered by the presence of noise. This noise is usually signal-dependent and often additionally correlated along rows or columns of pixels. Current self- and unsupervised denoisers can address signal-dependent noise, but none can reliably remove noise that is also row- or column-correlated. Here, we present the first fully unsupervised deep learning-based denoiser capable of handling imaging noise that is row-correlated as well as signal-dependent. Our approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a specially designed autoregressive decoder. This decoder is capable of modeling row-correlated and signal-dependent noise but is incapable of independently modeling underlying clean signal. The VAE therefore produces latent variables containing only clean signal information, and these are mapped back into image space using a proposed second decoder network. Our method does not require a pre-trained noise model and can be trained from scratch using unpaired noisy data. We benchmark our approach on microscopy datatsets from a range of imaging modalities and sensor types, each with row- or column-correlated, signal-dependent noise, and show that it outperforms existing self- and unsupervised denoisers.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models have achieved superior performance these days. Most recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image generation, in-painting, super-resolution, image editing and more. As a generalized diffusion model, cold diffusion further broadens the scope and considers models built around arbitrary image transformations such as blurring, down-sampling, etc. In this paper, we propose a k-space cold diffusion model that performs image degradation and restoration in k-space without the need for Gaussian noise. We provide comparisons with multiple deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models and perform tests on a well-known large open-source MRI dataset. Our results show that this novel way of performing degradation can generate high-quality reconstruction images for accelerated MRI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a critical molecular imaging modality that provides unique information about the tissue microenvironment, which is invaluable for biomedical applications. FLI operates by acquiring and analyzing photon time-of-arrival histograms to extract quantitative parameters associated with temporal fluorescence decay. These histograms are influenced by the intrinsic properties of the fluorophore, instrument parameters, time-of-flight distributions associated with pixel-wise variations in the topographic and optical characteristics of the sample. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled improved fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. However, existing models are primarily designed for planar surface samples, limiting their applicability in translational scenarios involving complex surface profiles, such as \textit{in-vivo} whole-animal or imaged guided surgical applications. To address this limitation, we present MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), a novel DL architecture that integrates the Instrument Response Function (IRF) as an additional input alongside experimental photon time-of-arrival histograms. Leveraging the capabilities of a Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet effectively focuses on critical input features, such as variations in photon time-of-arrival distributions. We evaluate MFliNet using rigorously designed tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft models. Our results demonstrate the model's robustness and suitability for complex macroscopic FLI applications, offering new opportunities for advanced biomedical imaging in diverse and challenging settings.</description>

Abstract: In this article we extend a recently introduced kinetic model for consensus-based segmentation of images. In particular, we will interpret the set of pixels of a 2D image as an interacting particle system which evolves in time in view of a consensus-type process obtained by interactions between pixels and external noise. Thanks to a kinetic formulation of the introduced model we derive the large time solution of the model. We will show that the choice of parameters defining the segmentation task can be chosen from a plurality of loss functions characterising the evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Implicit Optimization enables Robust Learnable Features for Deformable Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, existing DLIR methods forego many of the benefits and invariances of optimization methods. The lack of a task-specific inductive bias in DLIR methods leads to suboptimal performance, especially in the presence of domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between statistical learning and optimization by explicitly incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, we explicitly exploit invariances of the correspondence matching problem induced by the optimization, while learning registration and label-aware features, and guaranteeing the warp functions to be a local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features and arbitrary test-time regularization, which is not possible with existing DLIR methods.</description>
