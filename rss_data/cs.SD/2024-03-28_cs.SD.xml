      <title>ACES: Evaluating Automated Audio Captioning Models on the Semantics of Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning is a multimodal task that aims to convert audio content into natural language. The assessment of audio captioning systems is typically based on quantitative metrics applied to text data. Previous studies have employed metrics derived from machine translation and image captioning to evaluate the quality of generated audio captions. Drawing inspiration from auditory cognitive neuroscience research, we introduce a novel metric approach -- Audio Captioning Evaluation on Semantics of Sound (ACES). ACES takes into account how human listeners parse semantic information from sounds, providing a novel and comprehensive evaluation perspective for automated audio captioning systems. ACES combines semantic similarities and semantic entity labeling. ACES outperforms similar automated audio captioning metrics on the Clotho-Eval FENSE benchmark in two evaluation categories.</description>

      <title>Real Acoustic Fields: An Audio-Visual Room Acoustics Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new dataset called Real Acoustic Fields (RAF) that captures real acoustic room data from multiple modalities. The dataset includes high-quality and densely captured room impulse response data paired with multi-view images, and precise 6DoF pose tracking data for sound emitters and listeners in the rooms. We used this dataset to evaluate existing methods for novel-view acoustic synthesis and impulse response generation which previously relied on synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth) into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic field modeling techniques. Demos and datasets are available on our project page: https://facebookresearch.github.io/real-acoustic-fields/</description>

      <title>Dual-path Mamba: Short and Long-term Bidirectional Selective Structured State Space Models for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have been the most successful architecture for various speech modeling tasks, including speech separation. However, the self-attention mechanism in transformers with quadratic complexity is inefficient in computation and memory. Recent models incorporate new layers and modules along with transformers for better performance but also introduce extra model complexity. In this work, we replace transformers with Mamba, a selective state space model, for speech separation. We propose dual-path Mamba, which models short-term and long-term forward and backward dependency of speech signals using selective state spaces. Our experimental results on the WSJ0-2mix data show that our dual-path Mamba models match or outperform dual-path transformer models Sepformer with only 60% of its parameters, and the QDPN with only 30% of its parameters. Our large model also reaches a new state-of-the-art SI-SNRi of 24.4 dB.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Keyword Spotting through Self-supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice assistants are now widely available, and to activate them a keyword spotting (KWS) algorithm is used. Modern KWS systems are mainly trained using supervised learning methods and require a large amount of labelled data to achieve a good performance. Leveraging unlabelled data through self-supervised learning (SSL) has been shown to increase the accuracy in clean conditions. This paper explores how SSL pretraining such as Data2Vec can be used to enhance the robustness of KWS models in noisy conditions, which is under-explored.
  Models of three different sizes are pretrained using different pretraining approaches and then fine-tuned for KWS. These models are then tested and compared to models trained using two baseline supervised learning methods, one being standard training using clean data and the other one being multi-style training (MTR). The results show that pretraining and fine-tuning on clean data is superior to supervised learning on clean data across all testing conditions, and superior to supervised MTR for testing conditions of SNR above 5 dB. This indicates that pretraining alone can increase the model's robustness. Finally, it is found that using noisy data for pretraining models, especially with the Data2Vec-denoising approach, significantly enhances the robustness of KWS models in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Fusion approaches for emotion recognition from speech using acoustic and text-based features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different approaches for classifying emotions from speech using acoustic and text-based features. We propose to obtain contextualized word embeddings with BERT to represent the information contained in speech transcriptions and show that this results in better performance than using Glove embeddings. We also propose and compare different strategies to combine the audio and text modalities, evaluating them on IEMOCAP and MSP-PODCAST datasets. We find that fusing acoustic and text-based systems is beneficial on both datasets, though only subtle differences are observed across the evaluated fusion approaches. Finally, for IEMOCAP, we show the large effect that the criteria used to define the cross-validation folds have on results. In particular, the standard way of creating folds for this dataset results in a highly optimistic estimation of performance for the text-based system, suggesting that some previous works may overestimate the advantage of incorporating transcriptions.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion-Based Generative Equalizer for Music Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to audio restoration, focusing on the enhancement of low-quality music recordings, and in particular historical ones. Building upon a previous algorithm called BABE, or Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension, we introduce BABE-2, which presents a series of significant improvements. This research broadens the concept of bandwidth extension to \emph{generative equalization}, a novel task that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. BABE-2 is built around an optimization algorithm utilizing priors from diffusion models, which are trained or fine-tuned using a curated set of high-quality music tracks. The algorithm simultaneously performs two critical tasks: estimation of the filter degradation magnitude response and hallucination of the restored audio. The proposed method is objectively evaluated on historical piano recordings, showing a marked enhancement over the prior version. The method yields similarly impressive results in rejuvenating the works of renowned vocalists Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba. This research represents an advancement in the practical restoration of historical music.</description>

      <title>Duolando: Follower GPT with Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Dance Accompaniment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm. Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position. To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics.</description>

      <title>LCANets++: Robust Audio Classification using Multi-layer Neural Networks with Lateral Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio classification aims at recognizing audio signals, including speech commands or sound events. However, current audio classifiers are susceptible to perturbations and adversarial attacks. In addition, real-world audio classification tasks often suffer from limited labeled data. To help bridge these gaps, previous work developed neuro-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with sparse coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) in the first layer (i.e., LCANets) for computer vision. LCANets learn in a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, reducing dependency on labeled samples. Motivated by the fact that auditory cortex is also sparse, we extend LCANets to audio recognition tasks and introduce LCANets++, which are CNNs that perform sparse coding in multiple layers via LCA. We demonstrate that LCANets++ are more robust than standard CNNs and LCANets against perturbations, e.g., background noise, as well as black-box and white-box attacks, e.g., evasion and fast gradient sign (FGSM) attacks.</description>

      <title>\`{I}r\`{o}y\`{i}nSpeech: A multi-purpose Yor\`{u}b\'{a} Speech Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \`{I}r\`{o}y\`{i}nSpeech, a new corpus influenced by the desire to increase the amount of high quality, contemporary Yor\`{u}b\'{a} speech data, which can be used for both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. We curated about 23000 text sentences from news and creative writing domains with the open license CC-BY-4.0. To encourage a participatory approach to data creation, we provide 5000 curated sentences to the Mozilla Common Voice platform to crowd-source the recording and validation of Yor\`{u}b\'{a} speech data. In total, we created about 42 hours of speech data recorded by 80 volunteers in-house, and 6 hours of validated recordings on Mozilla Common Voice platform. Our TTS evaluation suggests that a high-fidelity, general domain, single-speaker Yor\`{u}b\'{a} voice is possible with as little as 5 hours of speech. Similarly, for ASR we obtained a baseline word error rate (WER) of 23.8.</description>

      <title>Golden Gemini is All You Need: Finding the Sweet Spots for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies demonstrate the impressive performance of residual neural networks (ResNet) in speaker verification. The ResNet models treat the time and frequency dimensions equally. They follow the default stride configuration designed for image recognition, where the horizontal and vertical axes exhibit similarities. This approach ignores the fact that time and frequency are asymmetric in speech representation. In this paper, we address this issue and look for optimal stride configurations specifically tailored for speaker verification. We represent the stride space on a trellis diagram, and conduct a systematic study on the impact of temporal and frequency resolutions on the performance and further identify two optimal points, namely Golden Gemini, which serves as a guiding principle for designing 2D ResNet-based speaker verification models. By following the principle, a state-of-the-art ResNet baseline model gains a significant performance improvement on VoxCeleb, SITW, and CNCeleb datasets with 7.70%/11.76% average EER/minDCF reductions, respectively, across different network depths (ResNet18, 34, 50, and 101), while reducing the number of parameters by 16.5% and FLOPs by 4.1%. We refer to it as Gemini ResNet. Further investigation reveals the efficacy of the proposed Golden Gemini operating points across various training conditions and architectures. Furthermore, we present a new benchmark, namely the Gemini DF-ResNet, using a cutting-edge model.</description>

      <title>NaturalSpeech 3: Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis with Factorized Codec and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have achieved significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g., content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and efficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and intelligibility, and achieves on-par quality with human recordings. Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K hours of training data.</description>
