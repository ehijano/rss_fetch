      <title>Circle packing on spherical caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the packing of congruent disks on a spherical cap, for caps of different size and number of disks, $N$. This problem has been considered before only in the limit cases of circle packing inside a circle and on a sphere (Tammes problem), whereas all intermediate cases are unexplored. Finding the preferred packing configurations for a domain with both curvature and border could be useful in the description of physical and biological systems (for example, colloidal suspensions or the compound eye of an insect), with potential applications in engineering and architecture (e.g. geodesic domes).
  We have carried out an extensive search for the densest packing configurations of congruent disks on spherical caps of selected angular widths ($\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/6$, $\pi/4$, $\pi/2$, $3\pi/4$, $5 \pi/6$) and for several values of $N$. The numerical results obtained in the present work have been used to establish (at least qualitatively) some general features for these configurations, in particular the behavior of the packing fraction as function of the number of disks and of the angular width of the cap, or the nature of the topological defects in these configurations (it found that as the curvature increases the overall topological on the border tends to become more negative).
  Finally we have studied the packing configurations for $N = 19$, $37$, $61$, $91$ (hexagonal numbers) for caps ranging from the flat disk to the whole sphere, to observe the evolution (and eventual disappearance) of the curved hexagonal packing configurations while increasing the curvature.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review presents the state of the art on the theory, molecular simulation, and coarse-grained strategies applied to the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size in the range 1 - 100 nm). Recent advances in the understanding of molecular diffusion and transport under thermodynamic gradients in nanoporous adsorbents are discussed with special emphasis on small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We provide a description of the fundamentals and principles of the different atom-scale and mesoscopic methods as well as of the theoretical formalisms that can be used to address such an important problem. Special attention is paid to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the so-called self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies.</description>

      <title>Chemically Regulated Conical Channel Synapse for Neuromorphic and Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluidic iontronics offer a unique capability for emulating the chemical processes found in neurons. We extract multiple distinct chemically regulated synaptic features from a single conical microfluidic channel carrying functionalized surface groups, using finite-element calculations of continuum transport equations. Such channels have long been employed for fluidic sensing and are therefore experimentally well established. By modeling a Langmuir-type surface reaction on the channel wall we couple fast voltage-induced volumetric salt accumulation with a long-term channel surface charge modulation by means of fast charging and slow discharging. These nonlinear charging dynamics are understood through an analytic approximation rooted in first-principles. We show how short-and long-term potentiation and depression, frequency-dependent plasticity, and chemical-electrical signal coincidence detection (acting like a chemical-electrical AND logic gate), akin to the NMDA mechanism for Hebbian learning in biological synapses, can all be emulated with a single channel.</description>

      <title>Neural density functionals: Local learning and pair-correlation matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arxiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023)]. We demonstrate that local one-body learning allows flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map, but that bulk pair-correlation matching alone does not. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>

      <title>Unifying atoms and colloids near the glass transition through bond-order topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this combined experimental and simulation study, we utilize bond-order topology to quantitatively match particle volume fraction in mechanically uniformly compressed colloidal suspensions with temperature in atomistic simulations. The obtained mapping temperature is above the dynamical glass transition temperature, indicating that the colloidal systems examined are structurally most like simulated undercooled liquids. Furthermore, the structural mapping procedure offers a unifying framework for quantifying relaxation in arrested colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Cell divisions imprint long lasting elastic strain fields in epithelial tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.</description>

      <title>Diffusion dynamics of an overdamped active ellipsoidal particle in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape asymmetry is the most abundant in nature and attracted great interest in recent research. The phenomenon is widely recognized: a free ellipsoidal Brownian particle displays anisotropic diffusion during short time intervals, which subsequently transitions to an isotropic diffusion pattern over longer time scales. We have further expanded this concept to incorporate active ellipsoidal particles characterized by an initial self-propelled velocity. This paper provides analytical and simulation results of diffusion dynamics of an active ellipsoidal particle. The active ellipsoidal particle manifests three distinct regimes in its diffusion dynamics over time. In the transient regime, it displays diffusive behavior followed by a super-diffusive phase, and in the longer time duration, it transitions to purely diffusive dynamics. We investigated diffusion dynamics for the free particle as well as the particle in a harmonic trap, and the particle subject to a constant field force. Moreover, we have studied the rotational diffusion dynamics and torque production resulting from an external constant force field. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of the scaled average velocity of an ellipsoidal active particle, considering both a constant force field and a one-dimensional ratchet.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet model of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Dual residence time for droplet to coalesce with liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When droplets approach a liquid surface, they have a tendency to merge in order to minimize surface energy. However, under certain conditions, they can exhibit a phenomenon called coalescence delay, where they remain separate for tens of milliseconds. This duration is known as the residence time or the non-coalescence time. Surprisingly, under identical parameters and initial conditions, the residence time for water droplets is not a constant value but exhibits dual peaks in its distribution. In this paper, we present the observation of the dual residence times through rigorous statistical analysis and investigate the quantitative variations in residence time by manipulating parameters such as droplet height, radius, and viscosity. Theoretical models and physical arguments are provided to explain their effects, particularly why a large viscosity or/and a small radius is detrimental to the appearance of the longer residence time peak.</description>

      <title>Decay dynamics of a single spherical domain in near-critical phase-separated conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain decay is at the heart of the so-called evaporation-condensation Ostwald-ripening regime of phase ordering kinetics, where the growth of large domains occurs at the expense of smaller ones, which are expected to `evaporate'. We experimentally investigate such decay dynamics at the level of a single spherical domain picked from one phase in coexistence and brought into the other phase by an opto-mechanical approach, in a near-critical phase-separated binary liquid mixture. We observe that the decay dynamics is generally not compatible with the theoretically expected surface-tension decay laws for conserved order parameters. Using a mean-field description, we quantitatively explain this apparent disagreement by the gradient of solute concentrations induced by gravity close to a critical point. Finally, we determine the conditions for which buoyancy becomes negligible compared to capillarity and perform dedicated experiments that retrieve the predicted surface-tension induced decay exponent. The surface-tension driven decay dynamics of conserved order parameter systems in the presence and the absence of gravity, is thus established at the level of a single domain.</description>
