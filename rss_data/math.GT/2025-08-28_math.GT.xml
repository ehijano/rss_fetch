      <title>Smooth functions that split a Klein bottle into two M\"obius bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $M$, consider the right action $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)\times\mathcal{D}(M)\to\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$, $(f, h) \mapsto f\circ h$, of the group $\mathcal{D}(M)$ of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ diffeomorphisms of $M$ on the space $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$ of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ functions on $M$. For $f\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$ denote by $\mathcal{O}(f)$ its orbit, and by $\mathcal{O}_f(f)$ the path component of $\mathcal{O}(f)$ containing $f$.
  The paper continues a series of computations by many authors of homotopy types of orbits $\mathcal{O}_f(f)$ of smooth functions on compact surfaces. We provide here the computations of $\mathcal{O}_f(f)$ for a special class of functions $f\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(K)$ on the Klein bottle $K$ having the following properties: (i) at each critical point $f$ is smoothly equivalent to some homogeneous polynomial (e.g. $f$ is Morse), and (ii) there is a regular connected component $\alpha$ of a level set of $f$ such that $K\setminus\alpha$ is a disjoint union of two open M\"obius bands, with closures $M_1$ and $M_2$. Let $f_i = f|_{M_i}$ be the restriction of $f$ to the M\"{o}bius band $M_i$, $i=1,2$, and $\mathcal{O}_{f_i}(f_i)$ be the path component of $f_i$ in its orbit with respect to the above action of $\mathcal{D}(M_i)$. The possible homotopy types of $\mathcal{O}_{f_i}(f_i)$ are explicitly computed earlier. We prove that $\mathcal{O}_f(f)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\mathcal{O}_{f_1}(f_1) \times \mathcal{O}_{f_2}(f_2)$.</description>

      <title>$SU(2)$-representations of Branched Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of irreducible $SU(2)$-representations for cyclic branched covers of knots in $S^3$. Our main result establishes that if $K$ is a non-trivial prime knot and $d$ is an integer such that $d \geq 2$ and $\Sigma_d(K)$ is an integer homology sphere, then $\pi_1(\Sigma_d(K))$ admits an irreducible $SU(2)$-representation, whenever $K$ satisfies one of two conditions: either $K$ is $2$-periodic, or $K$ can be represented as the closure of a tangle adapted to a $d\times d$ SICUP matrix. The first condition leverages a commuting trick for covering spaces to realize higher-degree branched covers as 2-fold covers, allowing us to apply recent results of Kronheimer-Mrowka and others. The second condition uses equivariant surgery descriptions and the $\nu^\sharp$ invariant from instanton Floer homology. As applications, we provide new infinite families of hyperbolic integer homology spheres admitting irreducible representations, including examples where previously known criteria fail.</description>

      <title>Morse functions constructed by random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct random Morse functions on surfaces by random walk and compute related distributions. We study the space of Morse functions through these random variables. We consider subspaces characterized by the surfaces with boundary obtained by cutting the closed domain surface of the Morse function at the levels of regular values. We consider Morse functions having a bounded number of critical points and one single local minimum. We find a small set of Morse functions which are close enough to any other Morse function in the sense that they share the same characterizing surfaces with boundary.</description>

      <title>Slope gap distribution of the double heptagon and an algorithm for determining winning vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of renormalized gaps between slopes of saddle connections on translation surfaces. Specifically, we describe a procedure for finding the "winning holonomy vectors" as defined by Kumanduri-Sanchez-Wang in arXiv:2102.10069, which constitutes a key step in calculating the slope gap distribution for an arbitrary Veech surface. We then apply this method to explicitly compute the gap distribution for the regular double heptagon translation surface. This extends work of Athreya-Chaika-Lelievre in arXiv:1308.4203 on the gap distribution for the "golden L" translation surface, which is equivalent to the regular double pentagon surface.</description>

      <title>A presentation for the category of $sl(3)$ webs and an extension of the quantum $sl(3)$-invariant to tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the $sl(3)$-polynomial invariant for links to tangles. Motivated by Kuperberg's construction of this invariant via planar trivalent graphs, we first define a category of $sl(3)$ webs and its sister linear category, and describe them via generators and relations. Then we define a functor from the category of oriented tangles to the linear category of $sl(3)$ webs, which yields an invariant for tangles and allows us to recover the $sl(3)$-polynomial invariant for links.</description>

      <title>The Habiro ring of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group.
  The main theorems of this paper concern number fields, their algebraic $K$-theory and its regulator maps (Borel, $p$-adic and \'etale), whereas the explicit collections of series are defined by a careful algebraic analysis of the infinite Pochhammer symbol at roots of unity.
  The origin of the above mentioned power series comes from perturbative Chern--Simons theory and by expansions of the admissible series of Kontsevich--Soibelman, both ultimately related to the infinite Pochhammer symbol. This link suggests that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.
  Added subsection 1.1 explaining what the paper is about and subsection 1.8 explaining the relation to perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homeomorphism groups of ordinals equipped with their order topology, focusing on successor ordinals whose limit capacity is also a successor. This is a rich family of groups that has connections to both permutation groups and homeomorphism groups of manifolds.
  For ordinals of Cantor--Bendixson degree one, we prove that the homeomorphism group is strongly distorted and uniformly perfect, and we classify its normal generators. As a corollary, we recover and provide a new proof of the classical result that the subgroup of finite permutations in the symmetric group on a countably infinite set is the maximal proper normal subgroup.
  For ordinals of higher Cantor--Bendixson degree, we establish a semi-direct product decomposition of the (pure) homeomorphism group. When the limit capacity is one, we further compute the abelianizations and determine normal generating sets of minimal cardinality for these groups.</description>
