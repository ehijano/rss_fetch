      <title>Power-Scalable Generation of High-Order Optical Vortices Via Coherent Beam Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light beams, such as optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum, are essential for applications ranging from low-power optical communications to high-intensity laser-matter interactions. However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Designing low-loss cavities across the band-gap of photonic crystal slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are defects in host photonic crystals (PCs) which create bound states in the PC band gap. These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.</description>

      <title>Enabling atom-clad waveguide operation in a microfabricated alkali vapor-photonic integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating alkali atomic vapors with nanophotonic devices offers a scalable route to quantum technologies that leverage strong atom-photon interactions. While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Superchiral Hot Spot in Dielectric Meta-Cavity for Ultra-Compact Enantioselective Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral nanophotonic structures have garnered considerable interest in recent years due to their potential to enhance the efficacy of chirality-sensitive biomolecular detection. Designing metaplatforms to enhance chiroptical signals under linearly polarized excitation is particularly appealing due to the minimal chiral background and the ease of controlling excitation polarization. Here, a novel two-step inverse design scheme for dielectric lossless metasurfaces with superchiral hot spots is proposed. The method extends the local density of field enhancements for non-chiral fields into the chiral regime and significantly surpasses previous enhancements in super-chiral field generation. It has been demonstrated that by leveraging the excitation of high quality factor modes with small mode volumes, it is theoretically possible to convert linearly polarized plane waves into a superchiral hot spot with record-high enhancement in the near-field optical chirality up to 104. A prototype is successfully implemented using advanced nanofabrication technologies. The optical characterization of the prototype demonstrates a 102-fold enhancement in optical chirality. The findings of this study unveil novel prospects for chiral spectroscopy with ultra-compact devices, underscoring the role of machine learning and physics-based inverse design in the development of cutting-edge, functional photonic structures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Imaging of Periodic Structures using Extreme Ultraviolet Scatterometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic scattering and imaging with coherent, ultrafast, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources can resolve charge, phonon and spin processes on their intrinsic length and time scales. However, full field coherent diffraction imaging requires scanning of the sample combined with computational phase retrieval, making it challenging to quickly acquire a large series of dynamic frames. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for extracting dynamic 1D images of the average unit cell in a periodic sample from traditional EUV scatterometry data by analyzing the changing intensities of the far field diffracted orders. Starting from a system of equations relating small changes in far field diffraction to phase and amplitude perturbations at the sample plane, it is shown that under certain conditions, changes to the $n$th diffracted order map exclusively onto the $n$th Fourier component of the perturbation via a closed-form relation. We show through rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulations that our method can provide a good approximation even outside the scalar diffraction theory framework in which it is derived. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this reconstruction method by exiting 1D nickel nanowires on a diamond substrate using an infrared laser pump pulse, and measuring their relaxation using a time-delayed EUV probe pulse, to visualize nanoscale phonon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional tapered fiber-based micro-waveguide for optical ultrasound microsensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various optical ultrasound microsensors have been developed with size ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. However, it becomes challenging to further minimize these sensors' size. In this work, we proposed a method that use a tapered fiber-based micro-waveguide (TFMW) attaching to the optical microsensor to bypass this challenge. The TFMW not only serves as the waveguide to transport ultrasound, but can also deliver light and actively excite ultrasound. In this study, we proposed the design and analyzed its performance using theoretical analysis and simulation.</description>

      <title>All-optical 3-input OR and 2-input AND/NIMPLY logic gates in a linear planar three-core optical fiber coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most all-optical logic processing devices reported in the literature rely on nonlinear effects, which increase implementation complexity and hinder scalability in larger optical circuits. In this work, we present the numerical modeling of two all-optical logic gates based on a fully linear, dispersion-free planar symmetric three-core optical fiber coupler. The devices operate with low-power amplitude-modulated pulses and require no nonlinear materials or mechanisms. By exploiting only the fiber geometry and coupled-mode theory, we demonstrate two logic processing functionalities: a 3-input OR gate and a configurable logic gate that performs either the AND or the NIMPLY operation, selected by a control signal. The proposed devices exhibit clear logical discrimination according to a contrast-based performance metric and feature simple structures that favor compact implementations and integration into larger linear photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>High efficiency and compact lithium niobate non-resonant recirculating phase modulator and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High modulation efficiency and a compact footprint are critical for next-generation electro-optic (EO) modulators. We introduce a new class of non-resonant recirculating phase modulators (PMs) that boosts modulation efficiency by repeatedly modulating the optical field within a single, non-resonant waveguide, while fundamentally removing the loop-length matching constraint that has limited prior recirculating schemes. This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$\pi$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$\pi$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$\pi$L of 0.7 V$\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a practical and highly efficient non-resonant recirculating modulation platform, laying the groundwork for scalable high-order mode recirculating modulators (RMs) and opening new opportunities in optical communications, sensing, and microwave photonics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Noise Analysis Method for Frequency Transfer System by Using ADEV Combine with EMD-WT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In precision frequency transfer systems, stringent requirements are imposed on the phase stability of transmitted signals. Throughout the transmission process, the inherent challenges of long-haul signal propagation inevitably introduce multiple noise components, including but not limited to thermal noise, phase fluctuations, and environmental interference. The system incline to use the conventional evaluation index - Allan deviation (ADEV) to reflect the system stability in order to evaluate the noise level. Whereas, ADEV can only provide numerical expression and lacks the time-frequency details. Therefore, a complete evaluation system is required by the system. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking integration of ADEV and wavelet transformed empirical mode decomposition (EMD-WT), establishing a novel analytical framework that enables simultaneous characterization of noise types and time-frequency domain properties. This synergistic approach achieves unprecedented dual-domain resolution in noise discrimination in frequency transfer systems.</description>

      <title>The Zero-Frequency Limit of Spherical Cavity Modes: On the Formal Endpoint at v=1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse magnetic (TM) modes of a spherical cavity satisfy a dispersion relation connecting the angular eigenvalue $\nu$ to the resonant frequency through zeros of the spherical Bessel function derivative. Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $\nu = -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $\nu \geq 0$, placing $\nu = -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $\Pi = \cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization.</description>

      <title>Deterministic exciton confinement in 2D semiconductors via local dielectric engineering for scalable quantum light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential building blocks for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. However, realizing scalable, on-chip SPEs on a CMOS-compatible platform remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose and theoretically demonstrate a scalable approach to exciton confinement in two-dimensional semiconductors via local dielectric engineering. By introducing a high-dielectric-constant nanopillar above or beneath the 2D material, we create a spatially varying dielectric environment that can support localized exciton states, enabling deterministic, lithography-compatible single-photon emission without relying on strain, defects, or etching of the 2D layer. Using numerical solutions to the 2D excitonic Schrodinger equation, we quantify the resulting confinement through binding energies, wavefunction profiles, and a spatial confinement parameter. These results offer a practical and scalable route for integrating 2D-based quantum emitters into photonic platforms, paving the way for next-generation quantum optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Exceptional Topology on a Klein Bottle Photonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Resolution and Robustness Bounds for Reconstructive Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructive spectrometers are a promising emerging class of devices that combine complex light scattering with inference to enable compact, high-resolution spectrometry. Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary laser frequency modulation algorithm based on iterative on-the-fly deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a general laser modulation control algorithm. I implement the LIDAR Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) scheme as a special case of study. My proposal applies to any arbitrary modulation pattern and is based on an iterative algorithm that infers the laser transfer function in order to perform on-the-fly deconvolution. I present an experimental proof-of-principle using an external-cavity diode laser, the accuracy of which I analyse by comparing the obtained frequency response with a targeted modulation pattern. In addition to the FMCW scheme, I am also testing square wave modulations, which are more demanding in terms of bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Snapshot 3D image projection using a diffractive decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.</description>

      <title>Optical Pin Beams: Research Progresses and Emerging Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pin beams (OPBs) represent a novel class of structured light fields engineered for resilient, long-distance propagation. Their exceptional stability and strong resistance to atmospheric turbulence make them a compelling alternative to conventional Gaussian and other structured beams for free-space optical systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the physical principles, generation strategies, experimental realizations, and emerging applications of OPBs. By precise spatial modulation of the optical wave vectors, OPBs achieve highly collimated, self-reconstructing propagation with distinctive pin-like features that confer remarkable robustness and self-healing capability. We further discuss several OPB derivatives--including vortex, inverted, and vortex-inverted OPBs--which expand the functional landscape by enabling flexible control over amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Experimentally, OPBs have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse platforms, ranging from free-space and underwater optical communications to optical trapping and super-resolution imaging. With their unique combination of propagation stability, light-field tunability, and environmental adaptability, OPBs hold strong promise for next-generation optical communication, precision sensing, and advanced imaging technologies. This review summarizes recent research progresses in OPBs and highlights key opportunities and prospects for advancing their scientific discoveries and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Programmable Optical Spectrum Shapers as Computing Primitives for Accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic convolutional accelerators have emerged as low-energy alternatives to power-demanding digital convolutional neural networks, though they often face limitations in scalability. In this work, we introduce a convolutional photonic accelerator that employs programmable kernels manifesting as trainable waveforms in the frequency domain to enable low-energy, high-throughput scalable image classification. The proposed scheme inherently provides dimensionality reduction and feature extraction directly in the optical domain. Numerical results targeting the Fashion-MNIST show that by using only 16 optical nodes, the system's classification accuracy tops at 90.1% when typical backpropagation is used. Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency loading of 2,400 Ytterbium atoms in optical tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Precision Bounds for Characterising Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer in a dispersion-engineered waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity state transfer is fundamentally limited by time-reversal symmetry: one qubit emits a photon with a certain temporal pulse shape, whereas a second qubit requires the time-reversed pulse shape to efficiently absorb this photon. This limit is often overcome by introducing active elements. Here, we propose an alternative solution: by tailoring the dispersion relation of a waveguide, the photon pulse emitted by one qubit is passively reshaped into its time-reversed counterpart, thus enabling perfect absorption. We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization. We further propose a spatially inhomogeneous waveguide that renders the state transfer robust to variations in qubit separations. In all cases, we obtain near-unity transfer fidelity (&gt;= 98%). Our dispersion-engineered waveguide provides a compact and passive route toward on-chip quantum networks, highlighting engineered dispersion as a powerful resource in waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin defects are excellent candidate platform for quantum sensing and quantum network. Nuclear spins coupled to color centers naturally enable long lived quantum memories and local qubits registers. To fully leverage this potential precise characterization of the surrounding nuclear-spin environment augmented with refined DFT models is required. In this work, we report angstrom-level 3D localization of 25 nuclear spins around a single V2 center in 4H Silicon Carbide. Utilizing specially placed robust nuclear memory as a highly efficient readout ancilla for readout, we apply correlation based spectroscopy and by selecting multi-spin chains up to length four, we access and characterize extended nuclear spin cluster. Using the coupling map we reconstruct their couplings to the central electron spin and neighboring nuclei. This work paves the way towards advanced quantum register applications on Silicon Carbide platform.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the interaction geometry of inverse Compton scattering x-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering is developing to be a promising method to generate coherent and tunable x-rays. In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions are topological structures of light whose defining property, the skyrmion number, is robust against perturbations. This makes them attractive for applications in quantum information storage, where resilience to decoherence is paramount. However, their preservation during coherent storage remains unexplored. We report the first experimental demonstration of storing and retrieving optical skyrmions in a cold $^{87}$Rb vapor using a dual-path electromagnetically induced transparency memory. Crucially, we show that the skyrmion number remains invariant for storage times up to several microseconds, even when subjected to imbalanced loss between the two paths and substantial perturbations in control beam power. Our work demonstrates the survival of a non-trivial topological invariant in a quantum memory, marking a significant step towards topologically protected photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the design and characterization of a laser pulse shaper, which creates an ``ultraslow optical centrifuge'' - a linearly polarized field whose polarization vector rotates with arbitrarily low angular acceleration. By directly recording this rotation in time with nonlinear cross-correlation, we demonstrate the tunability of such centrifuge (both in terms of its initial and its final rotational frequencies) in the range of accelerations which are three orders of magnitude lower than those available with a conventional centrifuge design. We showcase the functionality of the ultraslow centrifuge by spinning CS$_2$ molecules in a molecular jet. Utilizing the extremely low angular acceleration to control molecular rotation inside viscous media is a promising application for this unique optical tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multimode fibre endoscopes have recently shown their ability to unveil and monitor deep brain structures with sub-micrometre resolution, establishing themselves as a minimally-invasive technology with promising applications in neurobiology. In this approach, holographic control of the input light field entering the multimode fibres is achieved by means of wavefront shaping, usually treating the fibre as a complex medium. In contrast to other unpredictable and highly scattering complex media, multimode fibres feature symmetries and strong correlations between their input and output fields. Both step-index and graded-index multimode fibres offer a specific set of such correlations which, when appropriately leveraged, enable generating high-quality focused pulses with minimal intermodal dispersion. With this, we funnelled pulsed super-resolution STED microscopy with time-gated detection through a custom multimode fibre probe, combining the correlations of both multimode fibre types. We demonstrate resolution improvements over 3-times beyond the diffraction limit and showcase its applicability in bioimaging. This work provides not only a solution for delivering short pulses through step-index multimode fibre segments but also marks a step towards bringing advanced super-resolution imaging techniques with virtually no depth limitations.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the spatio temporal weak measurement of a chiral ultrafast optical pulse. We create a chiral vector wave packet by transmitting ultrashort laser pulse via a birefringent or magneto-optic medium. Employing time-resolved leakage radiation microscopy, we examine how the real and imaginary components of the weak value parameter ($\epsilon$) influence pulse propagation over time. Our technique allows us to detect and categorize the temporal polarization fluctuation in a $75$ fs pulse with an excellent repeatability. The achieved experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory consistency with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Bismuth nanogratings with narrow plasmon resonances for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were lacking other functionalities such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q &gt; 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto both the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (&gt; 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.</description>

Abstract: Ultrashort-pulse propagation in graded-index multimode fibers is a highly nonlinear phenomenon driven by several physical processes. Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control. Moreover, the same framework can potentially be applied to a wide variety of wave systems exhibiting analogous nonlinear and dispersive effects in optics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Gap-free Information Transfer in 4D-STEM via Fusion of Complementary Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by N-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of N-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.</description>
