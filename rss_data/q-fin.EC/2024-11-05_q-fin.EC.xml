      <title>Design and Analysis of Intellectual Property Protection Strategies Based on Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a novel intellectual property (IP) protection strategy using differential equation theory, aiming to analyze and optimize the effectiveness of IP protection. By developing a mathematical model, it explores the dynamic impact of IP protection intensity on both innovative enterprises and infringement activities. The study finds that a well-designed IP protection strategy can effectively reduce infringement while promoting technological innovation. The paper also discusses the effects of strategies under varying parameter conditions and verifies the model's rationality and effectiveness through numerical simulation. The findings provide theoretical support and references for formulating IP protection policies.</description>

      <title>Randomized Controlled Trials for Security Copilot for IT Administrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI (GAI) tools become increasingly integrated into workplace environments, it is essential to measure their impact on productivity across specific domains. This study evaluates the effects of Microsoft's Security Copilot ("Copilot") on information technology administrators ("IT admins") through randomized controlled trials. Participants were divided into treatment and control groups, with the former granted access to Copilot within Microsoft's Entra and Intune admin centers. Across three IT admin scenarios - sign-in troubleshooting, device policy management, and device troubleshooting - Copilot users demonstrated substantial improvements in both accuracy and speed. Across all scenarios and tasks, Copilot subjects experienced a 34.53% improvement in overall accuracy and a 30.69% reduction in task completion time. We also find that the productivity benefits vary by task type, with more complex tasks showing greater improvement. In free response tasks, Copilot users identified 147.07% more relevant facts and reduced task completion time by 61.94%. Subject satisfaction with Copilot was high, with participants reporting reduced effort and a strong preference for using the tool in future tasks. These findings suggest that GAI tools like Copilot can significantly enhance the productivity and efficiency of IT admins, especially in scenarios requiring information synthesis and complex decision-making.</description>

      <title>Can Loyalty to Creators Dilute Loyalty to Promoted Products? Examining the Heterogeneous Effects of Live-Streamed Content on Video Game Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have led to online consumption communities, or fandoms, that involve complex networks of ancillary creators and consumers focused on some core product or intellectual property. For example, video game communities include networks of players and content creators centered around a specific video game. These networks are complex in that video game publishers often sponsor creators, but creators and publishers may have divergent incentives. Specifically, creators can potentially benefit from content that builds their own following at the expense of the core game. Our research investigates the relationship between consuming live-streamed content and engagement with a specific video game. We examine the causal effect of viewing live-streamed content on subsequent gameplay for a specific game, using an unexpected service interruption of the livestreaming platform and time zone differences among users. We find live-streamed content significantly increases gameplay as a 10% increase in live-streamed viewing minutes results in a 3.08% increase in gameplay minutes. We also explore how this effect varies by user loyalty to different types of streamer channels (firm-owned, mega, and micro). The positive effects of live-streamed content are greatest for micro-streamers and smallest for mega-streamers. These findings are salient for firms allocating sponsorship resources.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Assessment for Predicting Human Development Index (HDI) Trends in the GCC Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on predicting the Human Development Index (HDI) trends for GCC countries Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Omanusing machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. HDI is a composite measure of life expectancy, education, and income, reflecting overall human development. Data was gathered from official government sources and international databases, including the World Bank and UNDP, covering the period from 1996 to 2022. Using the Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) method for feature selection, the model analyzed key indicators to predict HDI values over the next five years (2023-2027). The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for in-sample data, but minor overfitting issues were observed with out-of-sample predictions, particularly in the case of the UAE. The forecast results suggest that Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE will see stable or slightly increasing HDI values, while Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman are likely to experience minimal fluctuations or slight decreases. This study highlights the importance of economic, health, and educational indicators in determining HDI trends and emphasizes the need for region-specific predictive models to improve accuracy. Policymakers should focus on targeted interventions in healthcare, education, and economic diversification to enhance human development outcomes.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for cognitive structures and processes underlying innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business innovations are often arising from new combinations of pre-existing systems into new ones, coherently assembling features from their sources. We propose an abstract mathematical concept from category theory, the presheaf, to efficiently represent such coherent feature combinations. Moreover, operations on presheaves will allow us to formally describe and analyze business innovations that arise from novel mergings of systems from different domains. Equipped with such tools we provide an example by analyzing a successful case of such type of recombinant innovation, the digital hub concept proposed by Steve Jobs. The example shows how our framework can be used to bring formal rigor while preserving a fundamentally qualitative reasoning style.</description>

      <title>Donald Trumps in the Virtual Polls: Simulating and Predicting Public Opinions in Surveys Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have attracted attention due to their ability to generate human-like text. As surveys and opinion polls remain key tools for gauging public attitudes, there is increasing interest in assessing whether LLMs can accurately replicate human responses. This study examines the potential of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to replicate human responses in large-scale surveys and to predict election outcomes based on demographic data. Employing data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the American National Election Studies (ANES), we assess the LLM's performance in two key tasks: simulating human responses and forecasting U.S. election results. In simulations, the LLM was tasked with generating synthetic responses for various socio-cultural and trust-related questions, demonstrating notable alignment with human response patterns across U.S.-China samples, though with some limitations on value-sensitive topics. In prediction tasks, the LLM was used to simulate voting behavior in past U.S. elections and predict the 2024 election outcome. Our findings show that the LLM replicates cultural differences effectively, exhibits in-sample predictive validity, and provides plausible out-of-sample forecasts, suggesting potential as a cost-effective supplement for survey-based research.</description>

      <title>Can education correct appearance discrimination in the labor market?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of appearance discrimination in the labor market and whether education can mitigate this issue. A statistical analysis of approximately 1.058 million job advertisements in China from 2008 to 2010 found that about 7.7% and 2.6% of companies had explicit requirements regarding candidates' appearance and height, particularly in positions with lower educational requirements. Literature review indicates that attractive job seekers typically enjoy higher employment opportunities and wages, while unattractive individuals face significant income penalties. Regression analysis of 1,260 participants reveals a significant positive correlation between attractiveness scores and wages, especially in low-education groups. Conversely, in high-education groups, the influence of appearance on income is not significant. The study suggests that enhancing education levels can effectively alleviate income declines associated with appearance, providing policy recommendations to reduce appearance discrimination in the labor market.</description>

      <title>Information Aggregation in Markets with Analysts, Experts, and Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper shows that it can be advantageous for traders to publish their information on the true value of an asset even if they (i) cannot build a position in the asset prior to the publication of their information and (ii) cannot charge for the provision of information. The model also shows that the informational content of prices is U-shaped in the number of traders who publish their information. Put differently, information aggregation works best if either no trader, or if every trader publishes his information. Small groups of distinguished experts are, on the contrary, an obstacle to information aggregation. The model's key assumption is that the perception/interpretation of a given piece of published information differs slightly across traders.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Economic Complexity and Fiscal Crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight economic complexity's role in mitigating fiscal crises, often measured via an economy's trade structure. Trade, however, is just one facet of an economy's structure and omits critical innovative activities like research. Here, we investigate how a multidimensional approach to economic complexity-including both trade and research structures-relates to fiscal instability. By using data on over 230 national fiscal crises from 1995 to 2021 and hazard duration analysis, we assess how measures of trade and research complexity combine to explain crisis likelihood. We find that the interaction of complexity dimensions significantly reduces crisis probability, whereas individual indexes alone are not robust predictors. This suggests that economies focusing on a single dimension may be more vulnerable, thus highlighting the importance of balanced development across multiple areas. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to enhance economic resilience and mitigate fiscal risks.</description>

      <title>Seesaw Experimentation: A/B Tests with Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how a firm's performance can decline despite consistently implementing successful A/B test innovations -- a phenomenon we term "seesaw experimentation." While these innovations improve the measured primary dimension, they create negative externalities in unmeasured secondary dimensions that exceed the gains. Using a multivariate normal distribution model, we identify the conditions for this decline and propose positive hurdle rates as a solution. Our analysis shows how to set optimal hurdle rates to best mitigate these negative externalities and provides practical guidance for experimental design by demonstrating how these rates should vary with underlying parameters.</description>

      <title>Datasets for Advanced Bankruptcy Prediction: A survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bankruptcy prediction is an important research area that heavily relies on data science. It aims to help investors, managers, and regulators better understand the operational status of corporations and predict potential financial risks in advance. To improve prediction, researchers and practitioners have begun to utilize a variety of different types of data, ranging from traditional financial indicators to unstructured data, to aid in the construction and optimization of bankruptcy forecasting models. Over time, not only instrumentalized data improved, but also instrumentalized methodology for data structuring, cleaning, and analysis. With the aid of advanced analytical techniques that deploy machine learning and deep learning algorithms, bankruptcy assessment became more accurate over time. However, due to the sensitivity of financial data, the scarcity of valid public datasets remains a key bottleneck for the rapid modeling and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for targeted tasks. This study therefore introduces a taxonomy of datasets for bankruptcy research, and summarizes their characteristics. This paper also proposes a set of metrics to measure the quality and the informativeness of public datasets The taxonomy, coupled with the informativeness measure, thus aims at providing valuable insights to better assist researchers and practitioners in developing potential applications for various aspects of credit assessment and decision making by pointing at appropriate datasets for their studies.</description>

      <title>The contribution of US broadband infrastructure subsidy and investment programs to GDP using input-output modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than one-fifth of the US population does not subscribe to a fixed broadband service despite broadband being a recognized merit good. For example, less than 4% of citizens earning more than US $70k annually do not have broadband, compared to 26% of those earning below US $20k annually. To address this, the federal government has undertaken one of the largest broadband investment programs ever via The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with the aim of addressing this disparity and expanding broadband connectivity to all citizens. We examine broadband availability, adoption, and need for each US state, and then construct an Input-Output model to explore the potential structural macroeconomic impacts of broadband spending on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supply chain linkages. In terms of macroeconomic impact, the total potential indirect contribution to US GDP by the program could be as high as US $84.8 billion, $32.7 billion, and $9.78 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and additional programs, respectively. Thus, overall, the broadband allocations could expand US GDP by up to US $127.3 billion (0.10% of annual US GDP over the next five years). Moreover, the broadband packages within the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could create up to 230,000 jobs (0.14% labor market increase). We contribute one of the first economic impact assessments of the US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the literature.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Production Planning and Control Systems in Different Environments: A Comparative Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting the appropriate production planning and control systems (PPCS) presents a significant challenge for many companies, as their performance, i.e., overall costs, depends on the production system environment. Key environmental characteristics include the system's structure, i.e., flow shop, hybrid shop, or job shop, and the planned shop load. Besides selecting a suitable PPCS, its parameterization significantly influences the performance. This publication investigates the performance and the optimal parametrization of Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Reorder Point System (RPS), and Constant Work In Progress (ConWIP) at different stochastic multi-item multi-stage production system environments by conducting a comprehensive full factorial simulation study. The results indicate that MRP and ConWIP generally outperform RPS in all observed environments. Moreover, when comparing MRP with ConWIP, the performance clearly varies depending on the specific production system environment.</description>

      <title>Energy Price and Workload Related Dispatching Rule: Balancing Energy and Production Logistics Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing practices amid fluctuating energy prices, this study introduces a novel dispatching rule that integrates energy price and workload considerations with Material Requirement Planning (MRP) to optimize production logistics and energy costs. The dispatching rule effectively adjusts machine operational states, i.e. turn the machine on or off, based on current energy prices and workload. By developing a stochastic multi-item multi-stage job shop simulation model, this research evaluates the performance of the dispatching rule through a comprehensive full-factorial simulation. Findings indicate a significant enhancement in shop floor decision-making through reduced overall costs. Moreover, the analysis of the Pareto front reveals trade-offs between minimizing energy and production logistics costs, aiding decision-makers in selecting optimal configurations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Feature Selection Methods for Macro-Economic Forecasting, Applied for Inflation Indicator of Iran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores various feature selection techniques applied to macro-economic forecasting, using Iran's World Bank Development Indicators. Employing a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) within a 10-fold cross-validation setup, this research systematically analyzes and ranks different feature selection methodologies. The study distinctly highlights the efficiency of Stepwise Selection, Tree-based methods, Hausdorff distance, Euclidean distance, and Mutual Information (MI) Score, noting their superior performance in reducing predictive errors. In contrast, methods like Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and Variance Thresholding showed relatively lower effectiveness. The results underline the robustness of similarity-based approaches, particularly Hausdorff and Euclidean distances, which consistently performed well across various datasets, achieving an average rank of 9.125 out of a range of tested methods. This paper provides crucial insights into the effectiveness of different feature selection methods, offering significant implications for enhancing the predictive accuracy of models used in economic analysis and planning. The findings advocate for the prioritization of stepwise and tree-based methods alongside similarity-based techniques for researchers and practitioners working with complex economic datasets.</description>

Abstract: This review article examines the challenge of eliciting truthful information from multiple individuals when such information cannot be verified, a problem known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). This article reviews over 25 mechanisms designed to incentivize truth-telling in such scenarios and their effectiveness in empirical studies. Although many mechanisms theoretically ensure truthfulness as a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, empirical evidence regarding the effects of mechanisms on truth-telling is limited and generally weak. Consequently, more empirical research is needed to validate mechanisms. However, empirical validaton is difficult because most mechanisms are very complex and cannot be easily conveyed to research subjects. This review suggests that simple and intuitive mechanisms may be easier to empirically test and apply.</description>

      <title>Democratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20363</link>

Abstract: Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.</description>

      <title>Safety and Security Dynamics in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries: A Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting Security Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21511</link>

Abstract: The GCC region includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman, which are of critical geopolitical and economic importance, being rich in oil and positioned along vital maritime routes. However, the region faces complex security challenges, ranging from traditional threats like interstate conflicts to nontraditional risks such as cyber-attacks, piracy, and environmental concerns. This study investigates the safety and security index for six GCC countries using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to forecast security trends for the next five years. Data from the Global Peace Index and World Bank development indicators were employed to construct the model. Key indicators related to economic, political, and environmental factors were selected using the Edit Distance on Real Sequence feature selection method. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error of less than 10% across all countries. The results indicate that Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are likely to experience improvements in their safety and security indexes. At the same time, Kuwait and Oman may face challenges in maintaining their current levels of security. The findings suggest that economic diversification, environmental sustainability, and social stability are critical for ensuring long-term security in the region. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers in designing proactive strategies to address emerging security threats.</description>
