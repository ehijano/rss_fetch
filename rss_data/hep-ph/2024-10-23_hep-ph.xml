      <title>SUSY at the FPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are entering a new era. The failure to observe signals of sparticle production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has eroded the central motivation for SUSY breaking at the weak scale. However, String Theory requires SUSY at the fundamental scale $M_s$ and hence SUSY could be broken at some high scale below $M_s$. Actually, if this were the case, the lack of experimental evidence for low-energy SUSY could have been anticipated, because most stringy models with high-scale SUSY breaking predict that sparticles would start popping up above about 10 TeV, well beyond the reach of current LHC experiments. We show that using next generation LHC experiments currently envisioned for the Forward Physics Facility (FPF) we could search for signals of neutrino-modulino oscillations to probe models with string scale in the grand unification region and SUSY breaking driven by sequestered gravity in gauge mediation. This is possible because of the unprecedented flux of neutrinos to be produced as secondary products in LHC collisions during the high-luminosity era and the capability of FPF experiments to detect and identify their flavors.</description>

      <title>Beyond The Standard Model electrodynamics in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many motivated extensions of the standard model include new light bosons, such as axions and dark photons, which can mix with the ordinary photon. This latter, when in a dilute plasma, can be dressed by an effective plasma mass. If this is equal to the mass of the new degree of freedom, then a resonance takes place and the probability of transition between states is enhanced. This phenomenon of resonance conversion is at the very basis of multiple probes of dark matter, and it is typically studied within the so-called Landau-Zener approximation for level crossings. This latter is known to break down in a variety of scenarios, such as multiple level crossings or when the de Broglie wave length of the new boson is comparable to the scale over which the background plasma varies. We develop a flexible code adopting a 3+1 formalism in flat spacetime to perform non-linear simulations of systems with photons and new ultralight bosons in the presence of plasma. Our code currently allows to evolve one-dimensional systems, which are the ones of interest for this first study, but can be easily extended to treat three-dimensional spaces, and can be adapted to describe a plethora of realistic astrophysical and cosmological situations. Here we use it to study the breakdown of the Landau-Zener approximation in the case of multiple level crossings and when the slowly-varying plasma approximation ceases to be valid. In this first paper we detail our code and use it to study non-turbulent plasma, where small scale fluctuations can be neglected; their treatment will be considered in an upcoming publication.</description>

      <title>A Rotating-Wave Comagnetometer Detector for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many extensions of the Standard Model propose the existence of new particles or forces, aiming to answer mysteries such as the identity of the elusive dark matter. Atomic-based detectors are at the forefront of technologies designed to search for these particles or forces through their couplings to fermions, enabling the testing of well-motivated models, such as axion-like particles, which could form dark matter. These detectors also probe new long-range interactions between the detectors and spin-polarized objects, as well as interactions mediated by light particles that break CP symmetry, introducing a coupling between the detector and an unpolarized object. However, the sensitivity of these detectors is often constrained by magnetic noise, limiting their effectiveness to a narrow region of parameter space. We propose and develop a technique, which we name the Rotating Wave comagnetometer (RoW comag), that can suppress magnetic noise at tunable frequencies while maintaining high sensitivity to target signals, significantly expanding the potential reach of these detectors. We analyze its operation for testing various extensions to the Standard Model and show how it could improve current sensitivities by several orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for a new class of tabletop experiments aimed at searching for new physics, including the exploration of well-motivated axion-like particle dark matter models at higher masses than previously attainable.</description>

      <title>New Angles on Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected N-point energy correlator scales as M^N/N! on a jet with M particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of M^2 log(M) independently of N. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved N-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, and we propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behaviour.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Near-Side Energy-Energy Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy-energy correlator (EEC) of hadrons produced on the same side in $e^+e^-$ annihilation or in leading jets in $pp$ collisions. We observe a remarkable universality of the correlator. Using a non-perturbative transverse momentum dependent (TMD) fragmentation function to model the transition from the ``free-hadron" region to the perturbative collinear region, we are able to describe the near-side shapes and peaks over a wide range of energy for both the $e^+e^-$ annihilation and the $pp$ jet substructure measurements in terms of just two parameters. We present further predictions for the ratio of the projected three-point energy correlator to the EEC. The excellent agreement between our calculations and the experimental data may provide new insights into the role of non-perturbative physics for EECs, and suggests the possibility of exploring non-perturbative TMDs using theoretical tools developed for the energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Is leptogenesis during gravitational reheating flavourful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of charged lepton Yukawa equilibration on leptogenesis during gravitational reheating. During the post-inflationary era, the inflaton field is assumed to oscillate around the minimum of a monomial potential, leading to the gravitational production of Standard Model (SM) particles, constituting the radiation bath. The heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), responsible for generating baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis, are also produced through graviton-mediated scattering of the homogeneous inflaton field and thermal bath, as well as from the the inverse decay of the bath particles. By considering both minimal and non-minimal gravitational contributions to SM, we demonstrate that flavour effects can be safely neglected in the minimal reheating scenario. However, with large non-minimal coupling, these effects may become important, depending on the choice of the RHN mass. We identify the corresponding viable parameter space that satisfies the observed baryon asymmetry in each case.</description>

      <title>The "$B \to K{\pi}$ puzzle": A New Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological analysis based on the published branching fractions and $CP$ asymmetry observables of the $B\to K\pi$, $B\to\pi\pi$ and $B\to KK$ dataset is performed. The amplitude decomposition by the topological diagrams and the $SU(3)$ irreducible representation is used. The result of the global fit can be interpreted as a solution to the ``$B\to K\pi$ puzzle''. The obtained precision enables to test a $SU(3)$-based sum rule showing $6\sigma$ discrepancy with the expectation value in the Standard Model scenario. To improve the obtained results the main effort should concentrate on the $B^0\to K^0\pi^0$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Successful cogenesis of baryon and dark matter from memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and dark matter (DM) from evaporating primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical regime incorporating the impact of memory burden. In the simplest scenario of baryogenesis via vanilla leptogenesis with hierarchical right handed neutrino (RHN), it is possible to generate the observed BAU with memory-burdened PBH being sole contributor to the production of RHN. While it is not possible to achieve cogenesis in this minimal setup due to structure formation constraints on relic allowed DM parameter space, we show the viability of successful cogenesis in the resonant leptogenesis regime. We also show that successful cogenesis can be achieved in a simple baryogenesis model without taking the leptogenesis route. Due to the possibility of generating asymmetry even below the sphaleron decoupling era, the direct baryogenesis route opens up new parameter space of memory-burdened PBH. The two scenarios of successful cogenesis can also be distinguished by observations of stochastic gravitational waves produced from PBH density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting experimental mass limits on HECOs using Dyson-Schwinger resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs) appear in several theoretical particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and are actively searched for in current colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In such searches, mass bounds of these objects have been placed, using Drell-Yan and Photon-Fusion processes at tree level so far. However, such estimates are not reliable, given that, as a result of the large values of the electric charge of the HECO, perturbative QED calculations break down. We present a Dyson-Schwinger-like resummation scheme, which allows for a large gauge coupling and thus makes the computation of the pertinent HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing us to extract improved mass bounds for such objects from ATLAS and MoEDAL searches.</description>

      <title>Meson spin alignment and baryon polarization from coalescence with spin-vorticity non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate both the polarization of spin $1/2$ baryons and the spin density matrix coefficients of spin $1$ mesons using a thermal model that incorporates vorticity and polarization to describe quarks, along with a coalescence formalism where spin and vorticity are not in equilibrium. We find that while our model is not predictive due to its considerable number of free parameters, it has the potential to explain several seemingly puzzling features of experimental spin measurements, such as the absence of baryon polarization alongside significant vector meson spin alignment. We suggest the measuring meson spin off-diagonal matrix elements, and examining the dependence of polarization observables on azimuthal angles, as methods to falsify this model and gain insights into the freezeout details of baryon and meson spin structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high red shift $z$ by ultralight axion dark matter (DM) is discussed in the general relativistic framework. The critical condition of collapsing of self-attracting DM in non-relativistic treatment corresponds to dust particle, which allows to estimate the time scale of the SMBH formation and the its length scale in the general relativistic framework. It gives the support of ultralight axion model based on the string model as the origins of the early universe SMBH and the Little Red Dots (LRDs) etc. observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Double $\phi$ Production in $\bar{p}p$ Reactions Near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the double $\phi$ production processes in $\bar{p}p$ reactions near the threshold. We describe a notable violation of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule in $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions near the threshold by meson and baryon exchanges with hadronic degrees of freedom. Our study includes $t$- and $u$-channel diagrams that incorporate nucleon ground ($N$) and excited states ($N^\ast$), as well as $f$ and $\eta(2225)$ mesons in the $s$ channel. The excited states of the nucleon in the $t$ and $u$ channels encompass $N^\ast(1535, 1/2^-)$, $N^\ast(1650, 1/2^-)$, and $N^\ast(1895, 1/2^-)$, all of which are known to have significant coupling to strangeness. Our calculations suggest that the $N$ exchange in $t$ and $u$ diagrams contributes to a rapid increase in the total cross-section of $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions very close to the threshold. The diagrams involving $N^\ast(1650, 1/2^-)$ and $N^\ast(1895, 1/2^-)$ make a prominent contribution to the near-threshold cross sections, compared to the $N^\ast(1535, 1/2^-)$ exchange diagram. In the $s$ channel, the presence of three $f_0$ mesons ($f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2100)$, and $f_0(2200)$) and three $f_2$ mesons ($f_2(1950)$, $f_2(2010)$, and $f_2(2150)$) leads to a distinct peaking structure in the total cross sections, while the $\eta(2225)$ appears to contribute negligibly. Furthermore, the $\bar{\Lambda}\Lambda$ threshold results in a cusp structure in the total cross sections near 2231 MeV. Additionally, polarization observables offer crucial insights into the individual processes involved in the $\bar{p}p\to\phi\phi$ reactions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Quantum Circuit Monte-Carlo Simulation for Heavy Quark Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy quark thermalization in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is one of the most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction, where their energy loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. We propose an accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo (aQCMC) framework that ultilizes the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm to simulate heavy quark thermalization with quadratically less resources. Specifically, we simulate the thermalization of a heavy quark in both 1D and 2D and in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum simulator and compare that to analytical thermal expectations.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel analysis of the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible existence of nucleon-antinucleon bound states has been studied for decades. We investigate the $e^+e^-\to p\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-\to n\bar{n}$ cross sections in the nonrelativistic effective field theory framework. The proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron coupled-channel final state interactions are considered and found responsible for near-threshold enhancements. Both the proton-neutron mass difference and the Coulomb interaction between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ are considered, and the $N\bar{N}$ strong interactions are taken into account through a short-distance optical potential. By fitting the low energy constants in the amplitudes to the data for the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections from the BESIII and SND Collaborations, a $N\bar{N}$ quasi-bound state is found just above the $p\bar{p}$ threshold, and another $N\bar{N}$ pole is found on the unphysical Riemann sheet, farther away from the threshold. The constructed coupled-channel amplitude with Coulomb effects also offers a framework that can be used directly in experimental analyses on fine structures near the $N\bar{N}$ thresholds.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of a doubly charmed tetraquark candidate $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, we perform a systematic calculation of the mass spectra of doubly charmed tetraquark states from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations in a nonrelativistic constituent quark potential model. In terms of the quark-quark potential, the mass of the charmed spin-$1$ diquark is predicted $\sim 3500$ MeV. The masses of the light ``good'' and ``bad'' antidiquark are calculated with $\sim 670$ MeV and $\sim 840$ MeV, respectively. The mass difference between light ``good'' and ``bad'' diquarks is $\sim 170$ MeV, which is consistent with previous phenomenological analyses. The interaction between the charmed diquark and the light antidiquark is then modulated by the quark-antiquark potential in the model, and the mass spectra of doubly charmed tetraquarks from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations are calculated with the calculated masses of diquarks/antidiquarks and refitted parameters from $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $X(3872)$. The $1S-1P$ and $1S-2S$ mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks are about $410-430$ MeV and $610-650$ MeV, respectively, and this mass splittings pattern is similar to that for ordinary $D$ mesons. The mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks with isospin-$0$ is about $10-25$ MeV higher than the corresponding mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks with isospin-$1$ from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations. $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is possible to be assumed as a $IJ^P=01^+$ ground doubly charmed tetraquark candidate with a light ``good'' antidiquark, and the next $P$-wave excited doubly charmed tetraquarks are predicted to have masses with an average $420-430$ MeV higher. A $J^P=0^+$ ground doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3834)$ with isospin-$1$ located around $3834$ MeV is expected.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar but can be factors for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The calculation is also compared with the cases of Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future colliders. It's a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the $Z$ boson pair production from Higgs boson decay at $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the $H \to ZZ*$ process in CEPC by using the (Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) CGLMP inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 1$\sigma$ and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 2$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), with its high luminosity, will offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore the internal structure of atomic nucleus over an extended energy range from $\sqrt{s_{ep}} =$ 45 GeV to $\sqrt{s_{ep}} =$ 140 GeV. A particularly promising aspect of this collider is the study of the partonic structure with quasi-real photons which can also be studied in inclusive ultra-peripheral collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we present our validation of resolved photoproduction at fixed order for (next-to-)leading order using \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, a widely adopted framework at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-Like Particles with X-ray Observations of Alpha Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in stellar cores, where they interact with electromagnetic fields and electrons, with typical masses between $\mathcal O(0.1)$ and $\mathcal O(10)$ keV. These low-energy ALPs are gravitationally trapped in the orbits of stars and subsequently decay into two photons that we detect as monochromatic X-ray lines. We propose to search for these gravitationally trapped ALPs in the Alpha Centauri binary system, our closest stellar neighbor, using sensitive X-ray detectors like Chandra and eROSITA. Our search for ALP decay signals in the energy range of 0.2 keV to 10 keV yielded null results, thus establishing the most stringent limits on ALP interactions to date. Specifically, if ALPs are mainly produced by Compton or bremsstrahlung processes (ALP-electron coupling $g_{aee}$ being significant), we have improved the limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ by two to three orders of magnitude, in ALP mass range between 0.2 keV to 5 keV, compared to previous measurements, including those from GW170817, SN 2023ixf, and other sources.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>

      <title>On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called "prior volume" phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to the priors used by D'Amico et al. (2019). We point out that in addition to the "prior volume" effect there is a much more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the "prior volume" effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that the analysis choices of D'Amico et al.~(2019), especially their scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to a negligible ($\lesssim 1\%$) bias in the recovery of cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.</description>

      <title>511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-medium interactions of omega-mesons in infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei are investigated in a microscopic approach with nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-resonance particle-hole polarization modes. The nuclear polarization tensor formalism is used. Covariant mean-field self-energies are taken into account. Longitudinal and transversal self-energies are derived. The theoretical results are applied to finite nuclei in local density approximation. Applications to recent data on the in-medium width of omega mesons in 93-Nb are presented. The data are well described by self-energies containing S-wave and P-wave resonances. Low-energy parameters are determined. For the first time a spectrum of omega-nucleus bound states is obtained, albeit with reduced lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment into Euclidean windows allows for a tailored approach to address the different dominant challenges at short, intermediate, and long distances. We present a novel approach to compute the short-distance window without the need for using perturbative QCD. We combine a quenched continuum extrapolation using 18 lattice spacings ($1.6 \,\text{GeV} \lesssim a^{-1} \lesssim 6.1\,\text{GeV}$) with a separate continuum extrapolation of the sea-quark effects. This method allows for the computationally expensive sea-quark effects to be estimated using only a smaller number of ensembles at coarser lattice spacings, while largely confining the logarithmic dependency of the continuum extrapolation to the quenched component.</description>

      <title>The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for a next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. The detector will have an active liquid xenon target mass of 60-80 tonnes and is proposed by the XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN (XLZD) collaboration. The design is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology of the current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. A baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components are discussed. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory is also projected to have a 3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the atmosphere, sun, and galactic supernovae.</description>

      <title>Quintessence: an analytical study, with theoretical and observational applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytical expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Turning to the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytical bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>Pion-production cross sections in neutrino reactions for studying generalized parton distributions of the nucleon</title>

Abstract: Gravitational form factors of hadrons provide information on mass and pressure distributions in the hadrons, and they have been investigated by generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The GPDs also contain information on internal compositions of hadron spins. Understanding on the origin of hadron masses, pressures, and spins is an important topic not only in hadron physics but also as fundamental physics, and it should be clarified by the GPD studies. The spacelike and timelike GPDs have been measured at charged-lepton accelerator facilities, for example, by the virtual Compton scattering and the two-photon process, respectively. In this work, we show the $\pi^\pm$ and $\pi^0$ production cross sections in neutrino (antineutrino) reactions $\nu \,(\bar\nu) + N \to \ell + \pi + N'$ for measuring the GPDs of the nucleon by using the theoretical formalism of Pire, Szymanowski, and Wagner. The $\pi^\pm$-production cross sections are useful for determining gluon GPDs, whereas the $\pi^0$ production probes quark GPDs. In particular, we show the roles of the pion- and rho-pole terms, the contribution from each GPD term ($H$, $E$, $\tilde H$, $\tilde E$), the effects of the gluon GPDs $H_g$ and $E_g$, and the effects of the reaction energy on the neutrino cross sections. The $\pi^0$-production cross section is sensitive to the quark GPDs including the pion- and rho-pole GPD terms in the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage region. These cross sections could be measured at Fermilab in future. The neutrino GPD studies will play a complementary role to the projects of charged-lepton and hadron reactions for determining the accurate GPDs.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Scattering Search Using Cryogenic Light Detectors</title>

Abstract: The CSC (cryogenic scintillating calorimeter) technology devoted to rare event searches is reaching the sensitivity level required for the hunt of dark matter-electron scatterings. Dark matter-electron interactions in scintillating targets are expected to stimulate the emission of single photons, each of energy equal to the target electronic band gap. The electronic band gap in scintillators like NaI/GaAs is of O(eV). The search for this signal can be done by an array of cryogenic light detectors with eV/sub-eV energy resolution. In this work, we describe the detection principle, the detector response and the envisioned detector design to search for dark matter interacting with electrons via the measurement of the scintillation light at millikelvin. First sensitivity projections are provided, which show the potential of this research.</description>

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE$\nu$NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and $^{7}$Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of $\mathcal{O}$(eV) and exposures of $\mathcal{O}$(tonne-years), using CaWO$_{4}$ or Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Optimal Sensitivity of Lepton Flavor Violating Effective Couplings at the $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze lepton flavor violation (LFV) using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework at the future lepton colliders. Our focus is on the associated production of tau lepton with electron/muon at the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) colliders, related to four-Fermi SMEFT effective operators. In accordance with the upper limits on effective couplings from lepton flavor violating tau decays, we conduct a cut-based analysis to achieve sufficient signal significance. We utilize the optimal observable technique (OOT) to estimate the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings. The impact of electron beam polarization and the interplay of signal and background in enhancing the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings are discussed in detail. We find that the sensitivity of flavor-violating effective couplings is enhanced by order of one for 3 TeV center-of-mass (CM) energy and 1000 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>On convergence properties of GPD expansion through Mellin/conformal moments and orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of reconstructing the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We provide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal summation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and specify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on the conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and subsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x&gt;\xi$. Since experimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double or even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and Wilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the multiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via analytical continuations of integer summation indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the corrections to the two-loop amplitudes for $gg \to h$, $gg \to hg$, $qg \to hq$, and $q \bar q \to hg$ due to a modified cubic Higgs self-coupling. The exact dependence on the Higgs and top-quark masses across the entire $2 \to 2$ phase space is determined by numerically solving a system of differential equations for the relevant master integrals. The calculated amplitudes are crucial for evaluating the impact of the considered corrections on exclusive $pp \to hj$ production at the hadronic event level. As an application, we calculate the non-universal, kinematic-dependent cubic Higgs self-coupling corrections to the Higgs-boson transverse momentum distribution in gluon-gluon fusion Higgs production for arbitrary values of the transverse momentum.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data including the beyond the Standard Model $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$. Contrary to the dark photon case, we find no improvement in the $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result. The finding allows us to place exclusion limits on the coupling constant of the $Z'$ with mass in the range $M_{Z'} = 2$ GeV to 160 GeV.</description>

Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study from the theoretical point of view the $\Lambda_c^+\to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ reaction, recently measured by the Belle and BESIII Collaborations, where clear signals are observed for $a_0(980)$, $\Lambda(1670)$, and $\Sigma(1385)$ excitation. By considering the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ as dynamically generated resonances from the meson meson and meson baryon interaction, respectively, we are able to determine their relative production strength in the reaction, which is also tied to the strength of the $\pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ tree level contribution. We observe that this latter strength is very big and there are large destructive interferences between the tree level and the rescattering terms where the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ are generated. The $\Sigma(1385)$ contribution is included by means of a free parameter, the only one of the theory, up to a global normalization, when one considers only external emission, and we observe that the spin flip part of this term, usually ignored in theoretical and experimental works, plays an important role determining the shape of the mass distributions. Internal emission is also considered and it is found to play a minor role.</description>

      <title>PAIReD jet: A multi-pronged resonance tagging strategy across all Lorentz boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach of jet-based event reconstruction that aims to optimally exploit correlations between the products of a hadronic multi-pronged decay across all Lorentz boost regimes. The new approach utilizes clustered small-radius jets as seeds to define unconventional jets, referred to as PAIReD jets. The constituents of these jets are subsequently used as inputs to machine learning-based algorithms to identify the flavor content of the jet. We demonstrate that this approach achieves higher efficiencies in the reconstruction of signal events containing heavy-flavor jets compared to other event reconstruction strategies at all Lorentz boost regimes. Classifiers trained on PAIReD jets also have significantly better background rejections compared to those based on traditional event reconstruction approaches using small-radius jets at low Lorentz boost regimes. The combined effect of a higher signal reconstruction efficiency and better classification performance results in a two to four times stronger rejection of light-flavor jets compared to conventional strategies at low Lorentz-boosts, and rejection rates similar to classifiers based on large-radius multi-pronged jets at high Lorentz-boost regimes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on sterile neutrinos and the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological bounds on sterile neutrino masses in the light of the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. We argue that non-zero masses for sterile neutrinos are inferred at 2$\sigma$ level in some extended models such as varying dark energy equation of state, when a direct measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and weak lensing measurement of dark energy survey (DES) are taken into account. Furthermore, the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions are also reduced in such a framework. We also consider the case where a non-flat Universe is allowed and show that a slightly open Universe may be favored in models with sterile neutrinos in the context of the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Inflation Predicts Negative Running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on the varying electron mass model and axion-like early dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard rulers in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy models are regarded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and early dark energy models in new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicate a slightly longer sound horizon $r_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Meson-nucleus bound states in quark meson coupling model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formations of the $K(\bar{K})$, $D(\bar{D})$, and $B(\bar{B})$ meson-nucleus bound states in ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, ${\rm{^{197}Au}}$, and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$ nucleus are investigated using the quark meson coupling model. The model relies on a mean field description of non-overlapping nucleon bags bound by the self-consistent interactions of scalar ($\sigma$, $\delta$) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$) mesons with the (anti)quarks inside the bags, which is further extended to explore the properties of nuclei. We estimate the meson-nucleus bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon equations with the real potentials calculated self-consistently within the model, using a coordinate space approach. The calculations are carried out for different nuclear interactions. The effects of Coulomb interaction are considered in the present study for the charged mesons. Our study indicates the formation of rather deeply bound $B$-mesic states at the very central region of the nuclei, compared to the $D$ and $K$ mesons, offering a more promising probe to explore subtle nuclear medium effects. The investigations of such bound states are of particular interest for the upcoming $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ at FAIR, J-PARC-E29, and JLab experiments.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in WW and single-W events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-production and single-production of $W$ bosons provide many opportunities to look for new physics via precision measurements, for instance via scrutinising the involved triple-gauge vertices or by measuring CKM matrix elements in an environment very complementary to $B$ hadron decays. This contribution presents the ongoing work based on full simulation of the ILD concept, exploiting the O($10^8$) $W$ bosons produced during the $250$\,GeV stage of the ILC, as well as the CLD concept proposed for the FCC-ee. The projections, which also contribute to two focus topics of the current ECFA study on future Higgs/Top/Electroweak factories, promise improvements of the measurement precision of TGCs and the CKM matrix, respectively, of one to two orders of magnitude with respects to LEP.</description>
