      <title>Statistical mechanical space-time decomposition as a key to a (non-perturbative) quantization prescription for gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By assuming gravity and matter to be subject to a joint statistical mechanical concept (JSMC) and interpreting Rindler horizon sections as open thermodynamic systems, one arrives at a specific new form of non-perturbative Lorentzian path integral quantisation in a compact space-time region, with well-determined gravitational measure, adequate fixing of boundary conditions and causal geometries. JSMC implies a space-time decomposition, leading to a sum over configurations in line with path integral methods. In these developments, we carefully distinguish the concepts of Boltzmann's statistical mechanics and the path integral.</description>

      <title>Matrix-based Induced Metric with Non Commutative Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a matrix formulation for the induced metric on a brane, where non-commutative gauge fields play a central role. By starting from a general embedding of a p-brane in a higher-dimensional bulk, we derive the induced metric using commutator relations and extend the framework by incorporating gauge fields through a minimal coupling prescription. This approach not only draws an analogy with the effective acoustic metric in condensed matter systems but also provides insight into the emergence of light quanta as low-energy collective excitations of the quantum vacuum. In a simplified setting with a free Hamiltonian, we recover standard results in the appropriate limits while also uncovering new regimes characterized by a non-trivial coupling between the emergent gauge fields and the underlying matrix degrees of freedom. Our findings suggest potential pathways for connecting aspects of string theory matrix models with phenomenological features of emergent gravity.</description>

      <title>Causality in the maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime with $e^2 &lt; m^2$ can be interpreted either as an infinite chain of asymptotically flat regions connected by tunnels between timelike singularities or as a set of just one pair of asymptotically flat regions and one tunnel; the repetitions of this set in the infinite chain being identified. The second interpretation gives rise to the suspicion of acausality, i.e. the possibility of sending messages to one's own past. A numerical investigation of this problem was carried out in this paper and gave the following result. Let E be the initial point of a radial timelike future-directed ingoing geodesic G, lying halfway between the outer horizon and the image of the null infinity in the maximally extended RN spacetime. Let E$'$ be the first future copy of E. It was verified whether the turning point of G lies outside or inside the past light cone (PLC) of E$'$. In the second case the breach of causality does occur. It turned out that the acausality is present when $V_E$, the timelike coordinate of E, is negative with a sufficiently large $|V_E|$, and is absent with a sufficiently large $V_E &gt; 0$. In between these values there exists a $\widetilde{V}_E$, dependent on the initial data for the geodesic, for which the turning point lies on the PLC. So, the identification does lead to acausality. Nonradial timelike and null geodesics were also investigated, and a few hitherto unknown properties of the maximal extension were revealed. For example, the singularity arc at $r = 0$ may be convex or concave, depending on the values of $m$ and $e$.</description>
