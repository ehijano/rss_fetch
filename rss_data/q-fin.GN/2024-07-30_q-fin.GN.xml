      <title>AI-Powered Energy algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of quantitative finance, machine learning methods have become essential for alpha generation. This paper presents a pioneering method that uniquely combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, creating a dual-model alpha generation system integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. The methodology, implemented on the QuantConnect platform, aims to predict future price movements and optimize trading strategies. Specifically, it filters for highly liquid, top-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also accounting for broker payments. QuantConnect was selected because of its robust framework and to guarantee experimental reproducibility. The algorithm achieved a 31% return between June 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.669, demonstrating its potential. The findings suggest significant improvements in trading strategy performance through the combined use of the HMM and neural networks. This study explores the architecture of the algorithm, data pre-processing techniques, model training procedures, and performance evaluation, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world trading environments.

      <title>Security Issuance, Institutional Investors and Quid Pro Quo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16643v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Securities issuance through intermediaries is subject to agency problems and informational frictions. We examine these effects using SPAC data. We identify ``premium'' investors whose participation is linked to lower liquidation risk, higher returns, and lower redemption rates, consistent with both informational rents and agency frictions. In contrast, ``non-premium'' investors engage in non-agency quid pro quo relationships. Specifically, they receive high returns from an intermediary (quid) in exchange for a tacit agreement to participate in weaker future deals (quo). These relationships serve as insurance for issuers and intermediaries, enabling more issuers to access markets.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Money Laundering: Subgraph Representation Learning on the Blockchain with the Elliptic2 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning is a technique for analyzing local structures (or shapes) within complex networks. Enabled by recent developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies and other financial networks.</description>
