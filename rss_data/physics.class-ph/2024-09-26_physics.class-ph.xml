      <title>Interparticle-Fields Amplified Radiation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trajectories of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. Yet, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, in particular during coherent emission. We present a simple generalization of the LL equation for many bodies, which includes coherence effects in the self-force. This theory is shown both analytically and numerically to satisfy energy-momentum conservation as expected. By simulating a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, we show that the inclusion of interparticle fields can significantly affect the particle dynamics and the emission spectrum, even though the external field dominates over the interparticle fields.</description>

      <title>Vortical scattering channel in an aquatic space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theory descriptions of surface waves on flowing fluids have tended to assume that the flow is irrotational, but this assumption is often impractical due to boundary layer friction and flow recirculation. Here we develop an effective field theory of surface waves in an incompressible, inviscid flow that includes vorticity due to shear. Our model consists of a two-layer flow: an upper layer with no vorticity and a lower layer with constant vorticity. We consider linear, long-wavelength perturbations on top of such a flow, and find that these can be described by two coupled scalar fields admitting three elementary excitations, one more than the usual two found in irrotational flows. We compute the scattering coefficients pertaining to modes falling into an analogue black hole. Our approach provides a more realistic framework for simulating gravitational wave phenomena possibly with an internal structure mimicking quantum gravity effects in laboratory settings.</description>
