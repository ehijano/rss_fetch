      <title>The Chow--Witt rings of the classifying space of quadratically oriented bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the Chow--Witt rings of the classifying space ${\rm BSL}_n^c$ of quadratically oriented vector bundles of rank $n$. We also discuss the corresponding quadratically-oriented cobordism spectrum ${\rm MSL}^c$ and show that it is equivalent to $\rm{MSL}$ after inverting $\eta$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant geometric bordism, representation, labelled graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06565v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the following problem: {\em what $G_k$-representation polynomials in Conner--Floyd $G_k$-representation algebra arise as fixed point data of $G_k$-manifolds?}
  where $G_k=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$.
  Using the idea of the GKM theory, we construct a $G_k$-labelled graph from a smooth closed manifold with an effective $G_k$-action fixing a finite set. Then we give an answer to above mentioned problem through two approaches: $G_k$-labelled graphs and $G_k$-representation theory.
  As an application, we give a complete classification of all 4-dimensional smooth closed manifolds with an effective $G_3$-action fixing a finite set up to equivariant unoriented bordism.</description>

      <title>Spaces of subgroups of toral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of a compact Lie group G whose identity component is a torus, and consider how various invariants of subgroups behave as sheaves over this space. This feeds in to the author's programme to give algebraic models of rational G-equivariant cohomology theories.
  The methods are illustrated by making the outcome explicit for all toral subgroups of compact connected rank 2 groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a scissors congruence $K$-theory spectrum which lifts the equivariant scissors congruence groups for compact $G$-manifolds with boundary, and we show that on $\pi_0$ this is the source of a spectrum level lift of the Burnside ring valued equivariant Euler characteristic of a compact $G$-manifold. We also show that the equivariant scissors congruence groups for varying subgroups assemble into a Mackey functor, which is a shadow of a conjectural higher genuine equivariant structure.</description>

      <title>An Operadic Generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Shack Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplicial cochain complex can be derived from a locally small poset by taking the nerve of the poset viewed as a category. We show that the simplicial cochain complex and a relative Hochschild cochain complex of the incidence algebra of the poset are isomorphic as operads with multiplications. This result implies that the hG-algebras derived from those operads are isomorphic, which is a generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Shack theorem. The isomorphism also induces a differential graded Lie algebra isomorphism, which we use to compute the moduli space of formal deformations of the incidence algebra.</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Sheaf Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normal mode analysis (NMA) provides a mathematical framework for exploring the intrinsic global dynamics of molecules through the definition of an energy function, where normal modes correspond to the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix derived from the second derivatives of this function. The energy required to 'trigger' each normal mode is proportional to the square of its eigenvalue, with six zero-eigenvalue modes representing universal translation and rotation, common to all molecular systems. In contrast, modes associated with small non-zero eigenvalues are more easily excited by external forces and are thus closely related to molecular functions. Inspired by the anisotropic network model (ANM), this work establishes a novel connection between normal mode analysis and sheaf theory by introducing a cellular sheaf structure, termed the anisotropic sheaf, defined on undirected, simple graphs, and identifying the conventional Hessian matrix as the sheaf Laplacian. By interpreting the global section space of the anisotropic sheaf as the kernel of the Laplacian matrix, we demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between the zero-eigenvalue-related normal modes and a basis for the global section space. We further analyze the dimension of this global section space, representing the space of harmonic signals, under conditions typically considered in normal mode analysis. Additionally, we propose a systematic method to streamline the Delaunay triangulation-based construction for more efficient graph generation while preserving the ideal number of normal modes with zero eigenvalues in ANM analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct functors sending torus-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on toric schemes over the sphere spectrum to constructible sheaves of spectra on real vector spaces. This provides a spectral lift of the toric homolgoical mirror symmetry theorem of Fang-Liu-Treumann-Zaslow (arXiv:1007.0053). Along the way, we obtain symmetric monoidal structures and functoriality results concerning those functors, which are new even over a field $k$. We also explain how the `non-equivariant' version of the theorem would follow from this functoriality via the de-equivariantization technique. As a concrete application, we obtain an alternative proof of Beilinson's linear algebraic description of quasi-coherent sheaves on projective spaces with spectral coefficients.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a countable group $A$ with trivial bounded cohomology for all semi-separable coefficients and any group $\Gamma$, we prove that the bounded cohomology of certain restricted verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes in positive degrees, for all semi-separable coefficients. Examples of such verbal wreath products include the standard restricted wreath product (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups) as well as verbal wreath products arising from $n$-solvable, $n$-nilpotent and $k$-Burnside ($k = 2,3,4,6$) verbal products. As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in degree $n\geq 1$ for all semi-separable coefficients. Finally, we prove that the stable commutator length of any verbal wreath product $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of countable Tate modules over an arbitrary discrete ring embeds fully faithfully into that of condensed modules. If the base ring is of finite type, we characterize the essential image as generated by the free module of infinite countable rank under direct sums, duals and retracts. In the $\infty$-categorical context, we establish a fully faithful embedding of the $\infty$-category of countable Tate objects in perfect complexes, with uniformly bounded tor-amplitude, into the derived $\infty$-category of condensed modules. The boundedness assumption is necessary to ensure fullness, as we prove via an explicit counterexample in the unbounded case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of a merge tree to that of a generalized merge tree, a merge tree that includes 1-dimensional cycle birth information. Given a discrete Morse function on a $1$-dimensional regular CW complex, we construct the induced generalized merge tree. We give several notions of equivalence of discrete Morse functions based on the induced generalized merge tree and how these notions relate to one another. As a consequence, we obtain a complete solution to the inverse problem between discrete Morse functions on $1$-dimensional regular CW complexes and generalized merge trees. After characterizing which generalized merge trees can be induced by a discrete Morse function on a simple graph, we give an algorithm based on the induced generalized merge tree of a discrete Morse function $f\colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ that cancels the critical simplices of $f$ and replaces it with an optimal discrete Morse function.</description>

      <title>Cubical Approximation for Directed Topology II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes an equivalence between directed homotopy categories of (diagrams of) cubical sets and (diagrams of) directed topological spaces. This equivalence both lifts and extends an equivalence between classical homotopy categories of cubical sets and topological spaces. Some simple applications include combinatorial descriptions and subsequent calculations of directed homotopy monoids and directed singular $1$-cohomology monoids. Another application is a characterization of isomorphisms between small categories up to zig-zags of natural transformations as directed homotopy equivalences between directed classifying spaces. Cubical sets throughout the paper are taken to mean presheaves over the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category. Along the way, the paper characterizes morphisms in this variant as the interval-preserving lattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices.</description>

      <title>A novel characterization of structures in smooth regression curves: from a viewpoint of persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize structures such as monotonicity, convexity, and modality in smooth regression curves using persistent homology. Persistent homology is a key tool in topological data analysis that detects higher dimensional topological features such as connected components and holes (cycles or loops) in the data. In other words, persistent homology is a multiscale version of homology that characterizes sets based on the connected components and holes. We use super-level sets of functions to extract geometric features via persistent homology. In particular, we explore structures in regression curves via the persistent homology of super-level sets of a function, where the function of interest is - the first derivative of the regression function.
  In the course of this study, we extend an existing procedure of estimating the persistent homology for the first derivative of a regression function and establish its consistency. Moreover, as an application of the proposed methodology, we demonstrate that the persistent homology of the derivative of a function can reveal hidden structures in the function that are not visible from the persistent homology of the function itself. In particular, we characterize structures such as monotonicity, convexity, and modality, and propose a measure of statistical significance to infer these structures in practice. Finally, we conduct an empirical study to implement the proposed methodology on simulated and real data sets and compare the derived results with an existing methodology.</description>

      <title>Controllable Subspaces in Structured Networks of Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graphs: Controllability of Individual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01184v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of structured networks, this paper introduces the concept of the Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (FSSCS), enabling a comprehensive characterization of controllable subspaces. From a graph-theoretical viewpoint, the paper defines Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable (FSSC) nodes based on the FSSCS concept and establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for their identification. This paper proposes a method for determining the exact dimension of the Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (SSCS) in hierarchical directed acyclic graphs, employing a blend of graph-theoretical approaches and controllability matrix analyses. This approach not only facilitates the identification of FSSC nodes but also enhances our understanding of the robustness of node controllability against variations in network parameters within structured networks, marking a significant advancement in the field of strong structural controllability of individual nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1995, Cohen, Jones and Segal proposed a method of upgrading any given Floer homology to a stable homotopy-valued invariant. For a generic pseudo-gradient Morse-Bott flow on a closed smooth manifold $M$, we rigorously construct the alleged stable normal framings, which are an essential ingredient in their construction, and give a rigorous proof that the resulting stable homotopy type recovers $\Sigma^\infty_+ M$. We further show that other systems of compatible stable normal framings recover Thom spectra $M^E$, for all reduced $KO$-theory classes $E$ on $M$. Our paper also includes a construction of the smooth corner structure on compactified moduli spaces of broken flow lines with free endpoint, a formal construction of Piunikhin-Salamon-Schwarz type continuation maps, and a way to relax the stable normal framing condition to orientability in orthogonal spectra.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study neural networks' loss surfaces by methods of topological data analysis. We suggest to apply barcodes of Morse complexes to explore topology of loss surfaces. An algorithm for calculations of the loss function's barcodes of local minima is described. We have conducted experiments for calculating barcodes of local minima for benchmark functions and for loss surfaces of small neural networks. Our experiments confirm our two principal observations for neural networks' loss surfaces. First, the barcodes of local minima are located in a small lower part of the range of values of neural networks' loss function. Secondly, increase of the neural network's depth and width lowers the barcodes of local minima. This has some natural implications for the neural network's learning and for its generalization properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups to all rank-three Coxeter systems, beyond the previously studied spherical and affine cases. Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.</description>

      <title>Operadic Kazhdan-Lusztig-Stanley theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of operad-like structure called a P-operad, which depends on the choice of some collection of posets P, and which is governed by chains in posets of P. We introduce several examples of such structures which are related to classical poset theoretic notions such as poset homology, Cohen--Macaulayness and lexicographic shellability. We then show that P-operads form a satisfactory framework to categorify Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices and their kernel. In particular, this leads to a new proof of the positivity of the coefficients of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices.</description>
