      <title>Replicability in High Dimensional Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The replicability crisis is a major issue across nearly all areas of empirical science, calling for the formal study of replicability in statistics. Motivated in this context, [Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell STOC 2022] introduced the notion of replicable learning algorithms, and gave basic procedures for $1$-dimensional tasks including statistical queries. In this work, we study the computational and statistical cost of replicability for several fundamental high dimensional statistical tasks, including multi-hypothesis testing and mean estimation.
  Our main contribution establishes a computational and statistical equivalence between optimal replicable algorithms and high dimensional isoperimetric tilings. As a consequence, we obtain matching sample complexity upper and lower bounds for replicable mean estimation of distributions with bounded covariance, resolving an open problem of [Bun, Gaboardi, Hopkins, Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, Sivakumar, and Sorrell, STOC2023] and for the $N$-Coin Problem, resolving a problem of [Karbasi, Velegkas, Yang, and Zhou, NeurIPS2023] up to log factors.
  While our equivalence is computational, allowing us to shave log factors in sample complexity from the best known efficient algorithms, efficient isoperimetric tilings are not known. To circumvent this, we introduce several relaxed paradigms that do allow for sample and computationally efficient algorithms, including allowing pre-processing, adaptivity, and approximate replicability. In these cases we give efficient algorithms matching or beating the best known sample complexity for mean estimation and the coin problem, including a generic procedure that reduces the standard quadratic overhead of replicability to linear in expectation.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Kernels with Non-Symmetric Data: A Data-Agnostic Learnability Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are fundamental tools in statistics and machine learning with recent applications to highly over-parameterized deep neural networks. The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data. Targets having support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. While kernels are often highly symmetric objects, the data is often not. Thus kernel symmetry seems to have little to no bearing on the above eigenvalues or learnability, making spectral analysis on real-world data challenging. Here, we show that contrary to this common lure, one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data-measures to bound learnability on realistic data. As a demonstration, we give a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity of copying heads for kernels associated with generic transformers acting on natural language.</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotics of reweighted least-squares algorithms for linear diagonal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm aims to recover an unknown signal from linear measurements by performing a sequence of weighted least squares problems, where the weights are recursively updated at each step. Varieties of this algorithm have been shown to achieve favorable empirical performance and theoretical guarantees for sparse recovery and $\ell_p$-norm minimization. Recently, some preliminary connections have also been made between IRLS and certain types of non-convex linear neural network architectures that are observed to exploit low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional linear models. In this work, we provide a unified asymptotic analysis for a family of algorithms that encompasses IRLS, the recently proposed lin-RFM algorithm (which was motivated by feature learning in neural networks), and the alternating minimization algorithm on linear diagonal neural networks. Our analysis operates in a "batched" setting with i.i.d. Gaussian covariates and shows that, with appropriately chosen reweighting policy, the algorithm can achieve favorable performance in only a handful of iterations. We also extend our results to the case of group-sparse recovery and show that leveraging this structure in the reweighting scheme provably improves test error compared to coordinate-wise reweighting.</description>

      <title>You Only Accept Samples Once: Fast, Self-Correcting Stochastic Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce YOASOVI, an algorithm for performing fast, self-correcting stochastic optimization for Variational Inference (VI) on large Bayesian heirarchical models. To accomplish this, we take advantage of available information on the objective function used for stochastic VI at each iteration and replace regular Monte Carlo sampling with acceptance sampling. Rather than spend computational resources drawing and evaluating over a large sample for the gradient, we draw only one sample and accept it with probability proportional to the expected improvement in the objective. The following paper develops two versions of the algorithm: the first one based on a naive intuition, and another building up the algorithm as a Metropolis-type scheme. Empirical results based on simulations and benchmark datasets for multivariate Gaussian mixture models show that YOASOVI consistently converges faster (in clock time) and within better optimal neighborhoods than both regularized Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo VI algorithms.</description>

      <title>Prediction-powered Generalization of Causal Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inferences from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) may not pertain to a target population where some effect modifiers have a different distribution. Prior work studies generalizing the results of a trial to a target population with no outcome but covariate data available. We show how the limited size of trials makes generalization a statistically infeasible task, as it requires estimating complex nuisance functions. We develop generalization algorithms that supplement the trial data with a prediction model learned from an additional observational study (OS), without making any assumptions on the OS. We theoretically and empirically show that our methods facilitate better generalization when the OS is high-quality, and remain robust when it is not, and e.g., have unmeasured confounding.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Kernel Methods under Covariate Shift: Data-Dependent Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies kernel ridge regression in high dimensions under covariate shifts and analyzes the role of importance re-weighting. We first derive the asymptotic expansion of high dimensional kernels under covariate shifts. By a bias-variance decomposition, we theoretically demonstrate that the re-weighting strategy allows for decreasing the variance. For bias, we analyze the regularization of the arbitrary or well-chosen scale, showing that the bias can behave very differently under different regularization scales. In our analysis, the bias and variance can be characterized by the spectral decay of a data-dependent regularized kernel: the original kernel matrix associated with an additional re-weighting matrix, and thus the re-weighting strategy can be regarded as a data-dependent regularization for better understanding. Besides, our analysis provides asymptotic expansion of kernel functions/vectors under covariate shift, which has its own interest.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Quantile Regression: Prediction Intervals for Asymmetric Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing valid prediction intervals rather than point estimates is a well-established approach for uncertainty quantification in the regression setting. Models equipped with this capacity output an interval of values in which the ground truth target will fall with some prespecified probability. This is an essential requirement in many real-world applications where simple point predictions' inability to convey the magnitude and frequency of errors renders them insufficient for high-stakes decisions. Quantile regression is a leading approach for obtaining such intervals via the empirical estimation of quantiles in the (non-parametric) distribution of outputs. This method is simple, computationally inexpensive, interpretable, assumption-free, and effective. However, it does require that the specific quantiles being learned are chosen a priori. This results in (a) intervals that are arbitrarily symmetric around the median which is sub-optimal for realistic skewed distributions, or (b) learning an excessive number of intervals. In this work, we propose Relaxed Quantile Regression (RQR), a direct alternative to quantile regression based interval construction that removes this arbitrary constraint whilst maintaining its strengths. We demonstrate that this added flexibility results in intervals with an improvement in desirable qualities (e.g. mean width) whilst retaining the essential coverage guarantees of quantile regression.</description>

      <title>Feature learning in finite-width Bayesian deep linear networks with multiple outputs and convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Algorithms for Safe Bayesian Optimization with Monotonicity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially maximizing an unknown function $f$ over a set of actions of the form $(s,\mathbf{x})$, where the selected actions must satisfy a safety constraint with respect to an unknown safety function $g$. We model $f$ and $g$ as lying in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which facilitates the use of Gaussian process methods. While existing works for this setting have provided algorithms that are guaranteed to identify a near-optimal safe action, the problem of attaining low cumulative regret has remained largely unexplored, with a key challenge being that expanding the safe region can incur high regret. To address this challenge, we show that if $g$ is monotone with respect to just the single variable $s$ (with no such constraint on $f$), sublinear regret becomes achievable with our proposed algorithm. In addition, we show that a modified version of our algorithm is able to attain sublinear regret (for suitably defined notions of regret) for the task of finding a near-optimal $s$ corresponding to every $\mathbf{x}$, as opposed to only finding the global safe optimum. Our findings are supported with empirical evaluations on various objective and safety functions.</description>

      <title>Posterior and variational inference for deep neural networks with heavy-tailed weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider deep neural networks in a Bayesian framework with a prior distribution sampling the network weights at random. Following a recent idea of Agapiou and Castillo (2023), who show that heavy-tailed prior distributions achieve automatic adaptation to smoothness, we introduce a simple Bayesian deep learning prior based on heavy-tailed weights and ReLU activation. We show that the corresponding posterior distribution achieves near-optimal minimax contraction rates, simultaneously adaptive to both intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the underlying function, in a variety of contexts including nonparametric regression, geometric data and Besov spaces. While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network. We also provide variational Bayes counterparts of the results, that show that mean-field variational approximations still benefit from near-optimal theoretical support.</description>

      <title>Constrained or Unconstrained? Neural-Network-Based Equation Discovery from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.</description>

      <title>Planetary Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation data such as satellite imagery can, when combined with machine learning, have profound impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty through the prediction of living conditions, especially where government-derived economic indicators are either unavailable or potentially untrustworthy. Recent work has progressed in using EO data not only to predict spatial economic outcomes, but also to explore cause and effect, an understanding which is critical for downstream policy analysis. In this review, we first document the growth of interest in EO-ML analyses in the causal space. We then trace the relationship between spatial statistics and EO-ML methods before discussing the four ways in which EO data has been used in causal ML pipelines -- (1.) poverty outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2.) EO image deconfounding, (3.) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, and (4.) EO-based transportability analysis. We conclude by providing a workflow for how researchers can incorporate EO data in causal ML analysis going forward.</description>

      <title>Contextual Counting: A Mechanistic Study of Transformers on a Quantitative Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized machine learning across diverse domains, yet understanding their behavior remains crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications. This paper introduces the contextual counting task, a novel toy problem aimed at enhancing our understanding of Transformers in quantitative and scientific contexts. This task requires precise localization and computation within datasets, akin to object detection or region-based scientific analysis. We present theoretical and empirical analysis using both causal and non-causal Transformer architectures, investigating the influence of various positional encodings on performance and interpretability. In particular, we find that causal attention is much better suited for the task, and that no positional embeddings lead to the best accuracy, though rotary embeddings are competitive and easier to train. We also show that out of distribution performance is tightly linked to which tokens it uses as a bias term.</description>

      <title>Capturing Climatic Variability: Using Deep Learning for Stochastic Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting to the changing climate requires accurate local climate information, a computationally challenging problem. Recent studies have used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of deep learning, to learn complex distributions and downscale climate variables efficiently. Capturing variability while downscaling is crucial for estimating uncertainty and characterising extreme events - critical information for climate adaptation. Since downscaling is an undetermined problem, many fine-scale states are physically consistent with the coarse-resolution state. To quantify this ill-posed problem, downscaling techniques should be stochastic, able to sample realisations from a high-resolution distribution conditioned on low-resolution input. Previous stochastic downscaling attempts have found substantial underdispersion, with models failing to represent the full distribution. We propose approaches to improve the stochastic calibration of GANs in three ways: a) injecting noise inside the network, b) adjusting the training process to explicitly account for the stochasticity, and c) using a probabilistic loss metric. We tested our models first on a synthetic dataset with known distributional properties, and then on a realistic downscaling scenario, predicting high-resolution wind components from low-resolution climate covariates. Injecting noise, on its own, substantially improved the quality of conditional and full distributions in tests with synthetic data, but performed less well for wind field downscaling, where models remained underdispersed. For wind downscaling, we found that adjusting the training method and including the probabilistic loss improved calibration. The best model, with all three changes, showed much improved skill at capturing the full variability of the high-resolution distribution and thus at characterising extremes.</description>

      <title>Data Quality in Edge Machine Learning: A State-of-the-Art Survey</title>

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems trained using Machine Learning (ML) are shaping an ever-increasing (in size and importance) portion of our lives, including, but not limited to, recommendation systems, autonomous driving technologies, healthcare diagnostics, financial services, and personalized marketing. On the one hand, the outsized influence of these systems imposes a high standard of quality, particularly in the data used to train them. On the other hand, establishing and maintaining standards of Data Quality (DQ) becomes more challenging due to the proliferation of Edge Computing and Internet of Things devices, along with their increasing adoption for training and deploying ML models. The nature of the edge environment -- characterized by limited resources, decentralized data storage, and processing -- exacerbates data-related issues, making them more frequent, severe, and difficult to detect and mitigate. From these observations, it follows that DQ research for edge ML is a critical and urgent exploration track for the safety and robust usefulness of present and future AI systems. Despite this fact, DQ research for edge ML is still in its infancy. The literature on this subject remains fragmented and scattered across different research communities, with no comprehensive survey to date. Hence, this paper aims to fill this gap by providing a global view of the existing literature from multiple disciplines that can be grouped under the umbrella of DQ for edge ML. Specifically, we present a tentative definition of data quality in Edge computing, which we use to establish a set of DQ dimensions. We explore each dimension in detail, including existing solutions for mitigation.</description>

      <title>LOLA: LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm for Content Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital content landscape, media firms and news publishers require automated and efficient methods to enhance user engagement. This paper introduces the LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Upworthy, which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests aimed at evaluating the performance of various headlines associated with the same article content, we first investigate three broad pure-LLM approaches: prompt-based methods, embedding-based classification models, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Our findings indicate that prompt-based approaches perform poorly, achieving no more than 65% accuracy in identifying the catchier headline among two options. In contrast, OpenAI-embedding-based classification models and fine-tuned Llama-3-8b models achieve comparable accuracy, around 82-84%, though still falling short of the performance of experimentation with sufficient traffic. We then introduce LOLA, which combines the best pure-LLM approach with the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to adaptively allocate traffic and maximize clicks. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B testing method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic or numerous arms. Our approach is both scalable and broadly applicable to content experiments across a variety of digital settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.</description>

      <title>Progressive Inference: Explaining Decoder-Only Sequence Classification Models Using Intermediate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Progressive Inference - a framework to compute input attributions to explain the predictions of decoder-only sequence classification models. Our work is based on the insight that the classification head of a decoder-only Transformer model can be used to make intermediate predictions by evaluating them at different points in the input sequence. Due to the causal attention mechanism, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens seen before the inference point, allowing us to obtain the model's prediction on a masked input sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads. We develop two methods to provide sub-sequence level attributions using this insight. First, we propose Single Pass-Progressive Inference (SP-PI), which computes attributions by taking the difference between consecutive intermediate predictions. Second, we exploit a connection with Kernel SHAP to develop Multi Pass-Progressive Inference (MP-PI). MP-PI uses intermediate predictions from multiple masked versions of the input to compute higher quality attributions. Our studies on a diverse set of models trained on text classification tasks show that SP-PI and MP-PI provide significantly better attributions compared to prior work.</description>

      <title>Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Heavy Tails: Near-Optimality from Simple Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) with heavy-tailed gradients, where we assume a $k^{\text{th}}$-moment bound on the Lipschitz constants of sample functions rather than a uniform bound. We propose a new reduction-based approach that enables us to obtain the first optimal rates (up to logarithmic factors) in the heavy-tailed setting, achieving error $G_2 \cdot \frac 1 {\sqrt n} + G_k \cdot (\frac{\sqrt d}{n\epsilon})^{1 - \frac 1 k}$ under $(\epsilon, \delta)$-approximate differential privacy, up to a mild $\textup{polylog}(\frac{1}{\delta})$ factor, where $G_2^2$ and $G_k^k$ are the $2^{\text{nd}}$ and $k^{\text{th}}$ moment bounds on sample Lipschitz constants, nearly-matching a lower bound of [Lowy and Razaviyayn 2023].
  We further give a suite of private algorithms in the heavy-tailed setting which improve upon our basic result under additional assumptions, including an optimal algorithm under a known-Lipschitz constant assumption, a near-linear time algorithm for smooth functions, and an optimal linear time algorithm for smooth generalized linear models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce randomized algorithms to Clifford's Geometric Algebra, generalizing randomized linear algebra to hypercomplex vector spaces. This novel approach has many implications in machine learning, including training neural networks to global optimality via convex optimization. Additionally, we consider fine-tuning large language model (LLM) embeddings as a key application area, exploring the intersection of geometric algebra and modern AI techniques. In particular, we conduct a comparative analysis of the robustness of transfer learning via embeddings, such as OpenAI GPT models and BERT, using traditional methods versus our novel approach based on convex optimization. We test our convex optimization transfer learning method across a variety of case studies, employing different embeddings (GPT-4 and BERT embeddings) and different text classification datasets (IMDb, Amazon Polarity Dataset, and GLUE) with a range of hyperparameter settings. Our results demonstrate that convex optimization and geometric algebra not only enhances the performance of LLMs but also offers a more stable and reliable method of transfer learning via embeddings.</description>

      <title>Exact Conversion of In-Context Learning to Model Weights in Linearized-Attention Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02847v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has been a powerful emergent property of large language models that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In contrast to regular gradient-based learning, ICL is highly interpretable and does not require parameter updates. In this paper, we show that, for linearized transformer networks, ICL can be made explicit and permanent through the inclusion of bias terms. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between a model with ICL demonstration prompts and the same model with the additional bias terms. Our algorithm (ICLCA) allows for exact conversion in an inexpensive manner. Existing methods are not exact and require expensive parameter updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments that show the exact incorporation of ICL tokens into a linear transformer. We further suggest how our method can be adapted to achieve cheap approximate conversion of ICL tokens, even in regular transformer networks that are not linearized. Our experiments on GPT-2 show that, even though the conversion is only approximate, the model still gains valuable context from the included bias terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bandit best-arm identification, an algorithm is tasked with finding the arm with highest mean reward with a specified accuracy as fast as possible. We study multi-fidelity best-arm identification, in which the algorithm can choose to sample an arm at a lower fidelity (less accurate mean estimate) for a lower cost. Several methods have been proposed for tackling this problem, but their optimality remain elusive, notably due to loose lower bounds on the total cost needed to identify the best arm. Our first contribution is a tight, instance-dependent lower bound on the cost complexity. The study of the optimization problem featured in the lower bound provides new insights to devise computationally efficient algorithms, and leads us to propose a gradient-based approach with asymptotically optimal cost complexity. We demonstrate the benefits of the new algorithm compared to existing methods in experiments. Our theoretical and empirical findings also shed light on an intriguing concept of optimal fidelity for each arm.</description>

      <title>BWS: Best Window Selection Based on Sample Scores for Data Pruning across Broad Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data subset selection aims to find a smaller yet informative subset of a large dataset that can approximate the full-dataset training, addressing challenges associated with training neural networks on large-scale datasets. However, existing methods tend to specialize in either high or low selection ratio regimes, lacking a universal approach that consistently achieves competitive performance across a broad range of selection ratios. We introduce a universal and efficient data subset selection method, Best Window Selection (BWS), by proposing a method to choose the best window subset from samples ordered based on their difficulty scores. This approach offers flexibility by allowing the choice of window intervals that span from easy to difficult samples. Furthermore, we provide an efficient mechanism for selecting the best window subset by evaluating its quality using kernel ridge regression. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BWS compared to other baselines across a broad range of selection ratios over datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, and the scenarios involving training from random initialization or fine-tuning of pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Predicting unobserved climate time series data at distant areas via spatial correlation using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting time series data spatially distributed in many locations is often important for analyzing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. However, comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models (VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to the ability to generate fluent text in various languages, large language models have been successful at tasks that involve basic forms of logical "reasoning" over their context. Recent work found that selectively removing certain components from weight matrices in pre-trained models can improve such reasoning capabilities. We investigate this phenomenon further by carefully studying how certain global associations tend to be stored in specific weight components or Transformer blocks, in particular feed-forward layers. Such associations may hurt predictions in reasoning tasks, and removing the corresponding components may then improve performance. We analyze how this arises during training, both empirically and theoretically, on a two-layer Transformer trained on a basic reasoning task with noise, a toy associative memory model, and on the Pythia family of pre-trained models tested on simple reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Local to Global: Learning Dynamics and Effect of Initialization for Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based models have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling. To better understand this phenomenon, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study transformers. However, our current understanding in this regard remains limited with many fundamental questions about how transformers learn Markov chains still unanswered. In this paper, we address this by focusing on first-order Markov chains and single-layer transformers, providing a comprehensive characterization of the learning dynamics in this context. Specifically, we prove that transformer parameters trained on next-token prediction loss can either converge to global or local minima, contingent on the initialization and the Markovian data properties, and we characterize the precise conditions under which this occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind highlighting the role of initialization. We further demonstrate that our theoretical findings are corroborated by empirical evidence. Based on these insights, we provide guidelines for the initialization of transformer parameters and demonstrate their effectiveness. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

      <description>arXiv:2406.03130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative statistical method, called Ordinal Mixed-Effect Random Forest (OMERF), that extends the use of random forest to the analysis of hierarchical data and ordinal responses. The model preserves the flexibility and ability of modeling complex patterns of both categorical and continuous variables, typical of tree-based ensemble methods, and, at the same time, takes into account the structure of hierarchical data, modeling the dependence structure induced by the grouping and allowing statistical inference at all data levels. A simulation study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method and to compare it to the one of other state-of-the art models. The application of OMERF is exemplified in a case study focusing on predicting students performances using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022. The model identifies discriminating student characteristics and estimates the school-effect.</description>

      <title>Computational Limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Transformer-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) update for finetuning transformer-based models using fine-grained complexity theory. Our key observation is that the existence of low-rank decompositions within the gradient computation of LoRA adaptation leads to possible algorithmic speedup. This allows us to (i) identify a phase transition behavior and (ii) prove the existence of nearly linear algorithms by controlling the LoRA update computation term by term, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For the former, we identify a sharp transition in the efficiency of all possible rank-$r$ LoRA update algorithms for transformers, based on specific norms resulting from the multiplications of the input sequence $\mathbf{X}$, pretrained weights $\mathbf{W^\star}$, and adapter matrices $\alpha \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A} / r$. Specifically, we derive a shared upper bound threshold for such norms and show that efficient (sub-quadratic) approximation algorithms of LoRA exist only below this threshold. For the latter, we prove the existence of nearly linear approximation algorithms for LoRA adaptation by utilizing the hierarchical low-rank structures of LoRA gradients and approximating the gradients with a series of chained low-rank approximations. To showcase our theory, we consider two practical scenarios: partial (e.g., only $\mathbf{W}_V$ and $\mathbf{W}_Q$) and full adaptations (e.g., $\mathbf{W}_Q$, $\mathbf{W}_V$, and $\mathbf{W}_K$) of weights in attention heads.</description>

      <title>The Impossibility of Fair LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for fair AI is increasingly clear in the era of general-purpose systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs). However, the increasing complexity of human-AI interaction and its social impacts have raised questions of how fairness standards could be applied. Here, we review the technical frameworks that machine learning researchers have used to evaluate fairness, such as group fairness and fair representations, and find that their application to LLMs faces inherent limitations. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to LLMs or presents a notion of fairness that is intractable for LLMs, primarily due to the multitudes of populations affected, sensitive attributes, and use cases. To address these challenges, we develop guidelines for the more realistic goal of achieving fairness in particular use cases: the criticality of context, the responsibility of LLM developers, and the need for stakeholder participation in an iterative process of design and evaluation. Moreover, it may eventually be possible and even necessary to use the general-purpose capabilities of AI systems to address fairness challenges as a form of scalable AI-assisted alignment.</description>

      <title>Embarrassingly Parallel GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GFlowNets are a promising alternative to MCMC sampling for discrete compositional random variables. Training GFlowNets requires repeated evaluations of the unnormalized target distribution or reward function. However, for large-scale posterior sampling, this may be prohibitive since it incurs traversing the data several times. Moreover, if the data are distributed across clients, employing standard GFlowNets leads to intensive client-server communication. To alleviate both these issues, we propose embarrassingly parallel GFlowNet (EP-GFlowNet). EP-GFlowNet is a provably correct divide-and-conquer method to sample from product distributions of the form $R(\cdot) \propto R_1(\cdot) ... R_N(\cdot)$ -- e.g., in parallel or federated Bayes, where each $R_n$ is a local posterior defined on a data partition. First, in parallel, we train a local GFlowNet targeting each $R_n$ and send the resulting models to the server. Then, the server learns a global GFlowNet by enforcing our newly proposed \emph{aggregating balance} condition, requiring a single communication step. Importantly, EP-GFlowNets can also be applied to multi-objective optimization and model reuse. Our experiments illustrate the EP-GFlowNets's effectiveness on many tasks, including parallel Bayesian phylogenetics, multi-objective multiset, sequence generation, and federated Bayesian structure learning.</description>

      <title>Reparameterization invariance in approximate Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03337v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to improve generalization and interpretability of dynamical systems by recovering the underlying lower-dimensional latent states and their time evolutions. Previous work on disentangled representation learning within the realm of dynamical systems focused on the latent states, possibly with linear transition approximations. As such, they cannot identify nonlinear transition dynamics, and hence fail to reliably predict complex future behavior. Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flows for Conformal Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms estimate the uncertainty of a prediction model by calibrating its outputs on labeled data. The same calibration scheme usually applies to any model and data without modifications. The obtained prediction intervals are valid by construction but could be inefficient, i.e. unnecessarily big, if the prediction errors are not uniformly distributed over the input space.
  We present a general scheme to localize the intervals by training the calibration process. The standard prediction error is replaced by an optimized distance metric that depends explicitly on the object attributes. Learning the optimal metric is equivalent to training a Normalizing Flow that acts on the joint distribution of the errors and the inputs. Unlike the Error Re-weighting CP algorithm of Papadopoulos et al. (2008), the framework allows estimating the gap between nominal and empirical conditional validity. The approach is compatible with existing locally-adaptive CP strategies based on re-weighting the calibration samples and applies to any point-prediction model without retraining.</description>

      <title>Learning Long Range Dependencies on Graphs via Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), while excelling at capturing local relationships, often struggle with long-range dependencies on graphs. Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuralWalker achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/NeuralWalker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data visualization via dimensionality reduction is an important tool in exploratory data analysis. However, when the data are noisy, many existing methods fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. The method called Empirical Intrinsic Geometry (EIG) was previously proposed for performing dimensionality reduction on high dimensional dynamical processes while theoretically eliminating all noise. However, implementing EIG in practice requires the construction of high-dimensional histograms, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose a new data visualization method called Functional Information Geometry (FIG) for dynamical processes that adapts the EIG framework while using approaches from functional data analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms a variant of EIG designed for visualization in terms of capturing the true structure, hyperparameter robustness, and computational speed. We then use our method to visualize EEG brain measurements of sleep activity.</description>

      <title>Unified PAC-Bayesian Study of Pessimism for Offline Policy Learning with Regularized Importance Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy learning (OPL) often involves minimizing a risk estimator based on importance weighting to correct bias from the logging policy used to collect data. However, this method can produce an estimator with a high variance. A common solution is to regularize the importance weights and learn the policy by minimizing an estimator with penalties derived from generalization bounds specific to the estimator. This approach, known as pessimism, has gained recent attention but lacks a unified framework for analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive PAC-Bayesian framework to examine pessimism with regularized importance weighting. We derive a tractable PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that universally applies to common importance weight regularizations, enabling their comparison within a single framework. Our empirical results challenge common understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of standard IW regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Copula Models for Nonignorable Missing Data Using Auxiliary Marginal Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for modeling and imputation of nonignorable missing data under Gaussian copulas. The analyst posits a set of quantiles of the marginal distributions of the study variables, for example, reflecting information from external data sources or elicited expert opinion. When these quantiles are accurately specified, we prove it is possible to consistently estimate the copula correlation and perform multiple imputation in the presence of nonignorable missing data. We develop algorithms for estimation and imputation that are computationally efficient, which we evaluate in simulation studies of multiple imputation inferences. We apply the model to analyze associations between lead exposure levels and end-of-grade test scores for 170,000 students in North Carolina. These measurements are not missing at random, as children deemed at-risk for high lead exposure are more likely to be measured. We construct plausible marginal quantiles for lead exposure using national statistics provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Complete cases and missing at random analyses appear to underestimate the relationships between certain variables and end-of-grade test scores, while multiple imputation inferences under our model support stronger adverse associations between lead exposure and educational outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Neural Walk-on-Spheres (NWoS), a novel neural PDE solver for the efficient solution of high-dimensional Poisson equations. Leveraging stochastic representations and Walk-on-Spheres methods, we develop novel losses for neural networks based on the recursive solution of Poisson equations on spheres inside the domain. The resulting method is highly parallelizable and does not require spatial gradients for the loss. We provide a comprehensive comparison against competing methods based on PINNs, the Deep Ritz method, and (backward) stochastic differential equations. In several challenging, high-dimensional numerical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of NWoS in accuracy, speed, and computational costs. Compared to commonly used PINNs, our approach can reduce memory usage and errors by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we apply NWoS to problems in PDE-constrained optimization and molecular dynamics to show its efficiency in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks readily learn a subset of the modular arithmetic tasks, while failing to generalize on the rest. This limitation remains unmoved by the choice of architecture and training strategies. On the other hand, an analytical solution for the weights of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) networks that generalize on the modular addition task is known in the literature. In this work, we (i) extend the class of analytical solutions to include modular multiplication as well as modular addition with many terms. Additionally, we show that real networks trained on these datasets learn similar solutions upon generalization (grokking). (ii) We combine these "expert" solutions to construct networks that generalize on arbitrary modular polynomials. (iii) We hypothesize a classification of modular polynomials into learnable and non-learnable via neural networks training; and provide experimental evidence supporting our claims.</description>

      <title>Posterior Inference on Shallow Infinitely Wide Bayesian Neural Networks under Weights with Unbounded Variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the classical and influential works of Neal (1996), it is known that the infinite width scaling limit of a Bayesian neural network with one hidden layer is a Gaussian process, when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Neal's result has been extended to networks with multiple hidden layers and to convolutional neural networks, also with Gaussian process scaling limits. The tractable properties of Gaussian processes then allow straightforward posterior inference and uncertainty quantification, considerably simplifying the study of the limit process compared to a network of finite width. Neural network weights with unbounded variance, however, pose unique challenges. In this case, the classical central limit theorem breaks down and it is well known that the scaling limit is an $\alpha$-stable process under suitable conditions. However, current literature is primarily limited to forward simulations under these processes and the problem of posterior inference under such a scaling limit remains largely unaddressed, unlike in the Gaussian process case. To this end, our contribution is an interpretable and computationally efficient procedure for posterior inference, using a conditionally Gaussian representation, that then allows full use of the Gaussian process machinery for tractable posterior inference and uncertainty quantification in the non-Gaussian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group-invariant generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of GANs in which the generators and discriminators are hardwired with group symmetries. Empirical studies have shown that these networks are capable of learning group-invariant distributions with significantly improved data efficiency. In this study, we aim to rigorously quantify this improvement by analyzing the reduction in sample complexity for group-invariant GANs. Our findings indicate that when learning group-invariant distributions, the number of samples required for group-invariant GANs decreases proportionally by a factor of the group size. Importantly, this sample complexity reduction cannot be achieved merely through data augmentation due to the probabilistic dependence of augmented data. Numerical results substantiate our theory and highlight the stark contrast between learning with group-invariant GANs and using data augmentation. This work presents the first statistical performance guarantees for group-invariant generative models, specifically for GANs, and it may shed light on the study of other generative models with group symmetries.</description>

      <title>How do Transformers perform In-Context Autoregressive Learning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language modeling tasks. However, the reasons behind their tremendous success are still unclear. In this paper, towards a better understanding, we train a Transformer model on a simple next token prediction task, where sequences are generated as a first-order autoregressive process $s_{t+1} = W s_t$. We show how a trained Transformer predicts the next token by first learning $W$ in-context, then applying a prediction mapping. We call the resulting procedure in-context autoregressive learning. More precisely, focusing on commuting orthogonal matrices $W$, we first show that a trained one-layer linear Transformer implements one step of gradient descent for the minimization of an inner objective function, when considering augmented tokens. When the tokens are not augmented, we characterize the global minima of a one-layer diagonal linear multi-head Transformer. Importantly, we exhibit orthogonality between heads and show that positional encoding captures trigonometric relations in the data. On the experimental side, we consider the general case of non-commuting orthogonal matrices and generalize our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Negative impact of heavy-tailed uncertainty and error distributions on the reliability of calibration statistics for machine learning regression tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average calibration of the (variance-based) prediction uncertainties of machine learning regression tasks can be tested in two ways: one is to estimate the calibration error (CE) as the difference between the mean absolute error (MSE) and the mean variance (MV); the alternative is to compare the mean squared z-scores (ZMS) to 1. The problem is that both approaches might lead to different conclusions, as illustrated in this study for an ensemble of datasets from the recent machine learning uncertainty quantification (ML-UQ) literature. It is shown that the estimation of MV, MSE and their confidence intervals becomes unreliable for heavy-tailed uncertainty and error distributions, which seems to be a frequent feature of ML-UQ datasets. By contrast, the ZMS statistic is less sensitive and offers the most reliable approach in this context. Unfortunately, the same problem is expected to affect also conditional calibrations statistics, such as the popular ENCE, and very likely post-hoc calibration methods based on similar statistics. Several solutions to circumvent the outlined problems are proposed.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider the realm of covariance matrices in machine learning, particularly focusing on computing Fr\'echet means on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, commonly referred to as Karcher or geometric means. Such means are leveraged in numerous machine-learning tasks. Relying on advanced statistical tools, we introduce a random matrix theory-based method that estimates Fr\'echet means, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with low sample support and a high number of matrices to average. Our experimental evaluation, involving both synthetic and real-world EEG and hyperspectral datasets, shows that we largely outperform state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Topic Models with Survival Supervision: Jointly Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes and Learning How Clinical Features Relate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neural network framework for learning a survival model to predict a time-to-event outcome while simultaneously learning a topic model that reveals feature relationships. In particular, we model each subject as a distribution over "topics", where a topic could, for instance, correspond to an age group, a disorder, or a disease. The presence of a topic in a subject means that specific clinical features are more likely to appear for the subject. Topics encode information about related features and are learned in a supervised manner to predict a time-to-event outcome. Our framework supports combining many different topic and survival models; training the resulting joint survival-topic model readily scales to large datasets using standard neural net optimizers with minibatch gradient descent. For example, a special case is to combine LDA with a Cox model, in which case a subject's distribution over topics serves as the input feature vector to the Cox model. We explain how to address practical implementation issues that arise when applying these neural survival-supervised topic models to clinical data, including how to visualize results to assist clinical interpretation. We study the effectiveness of our proposed framework on seven clinical datasets on predicting time until death as well as hospital ICU length of stay, where we find that neural survival-supervised topic models achieve competitive accuracy with existing approaches while yielding interpretable clinical topics that explain feature relationships.

Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning methods combine the graph structure and labeled data to classify unlabeled data. In this work, we study the effect of a noisy oracle on classification. In particular, we derive the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator for clustering a Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM) when a noisy oracle reveals a fraction of the labels. We then propose an algorithm derived from a continuous relaxation of the MAP, and we establish its consistency. Numerical experiments show that our approach achieves promising performance on synthetic and real data sets, even in the case of very noisy labeled data.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a sparse, high-dimensional stationary multivariate Gaussian time series. A sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem based on frequency-domain sufficient statistic for the observed time series is presented. We investigate an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach for optimization of the sparse-group lasso penalized log-likelihood. We provide sufficient conditions for convergence in the Frobenius norm of the inverse PSD estimators to the true value, jointly across all frequencies, where the number of frequencies are allowed to increase with sample size. This results also yields a rate of convergence. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</description>

Abstract: We present a general duality result for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization that holds for any Kantorovich transport cost, measurable loss function, and nominal probability distribution. Assuming an interchangeability principle inherent in existing duality results, our proof only uses one-dimensional convex analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interchangeability principle holds if and only if certain measurable projection and weak measurable selection conditions are satisfied. To illustrate the broader applicability of our approach, we provide a rigorous treatment of duality results in distributionally robust Markov decision processes and distributionally robust multistage stochastic programming. Additionally, we extend our analysis to other problems such as infinity-Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, risk-averse optimization, and globalized distributionally robust counterpart.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Ranking and Translation Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, such as sport tournaments or recommendation systems, we have at our disposal data consisting of pairwise comparisons between a set of $n$ items (or players). The objective is to use this data to infer the latent strength of each item and/or their ranking. Existing results for this problem predominantly focus on the setting consisting of a single comparison graph $G$. However, there exist scenarios (e.g., sports tournaments) where the the pairwise comparison data evolves with time. Theoretical results for this dynamic setting are relatively limited and is the focus of this paper.
  We study an extension of the \emph{translation synchronization} problem, to the dynamic setting. In this setup, we are given a sequence of comparison graphs $(G_t)_{t\in \mathcal{T}}$, where $\mathcal{T} \subset [0,1]$ is a grid representing the time domain, and for each item $i$ and time $t\in \mathcal{T}$ there is an associated unknown strength parameter $z^*_{t,i}\in \mathbb{R}$. We aim to recover, for $t\in\mathcal{T}$, the strength vector $z^*_t=(z^*_{t,1},\dots,z^*_{t,n})$ from noisy measurements of $z^*_{t,i}-z^*_{t,j}$, where $\{i,j\}$ is an edge in $G_t$. Assuming that $z^*_t$ evolves smoothly in $t$, we propose two estimators -- one based on a smoothness-penalized least squares approach and the other based on projection onto the low frequency eigenspace of a suitable smoothness operator. For both estimators, we provide finite sample bounds for the $\ell_2$ estimation error under the assumption that $G_t$ is connected for all $t\in \mathcal{T}$, thus proving the consistency of the proposed methods in terms of the grid size $|\mathcal{T}|$. We complement our theoretical findings with experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Graph Fusion via Encoder Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method called graph fusion embedding, designed for multi-graph embedding with shared vertex sets. Under the framework of supervised learning, our method exhibits a remarkable and highly desirable synergistic effect: for sufficiently large vertex size, the accuracy of vertex classification consistently benefits from the incorporation of additional graphs. We establish the mathematical foundation for the method, including the asymptotic convergence of the embedding, a sufficient condition for asymptotic optimal classification, and the proof of the synergistic effect for vertex classification. Our comprehensive simulations and real data experiments provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing the pronounced synergistic effect for multiple graphs from disparate sources.</description>

      <title>The No Free Lunch Theorem, Kolmogorov Complexity, and the Role of Inductive Biases in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Improved Convergence of Score-Based Diffusion Models via Prediction-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) are powerful tools to sample from complex data distributions. Their underlying idea is to (i) run a forward process for time $T_1$ by adding noise to the data, (ii) estimate its score function, and (iii) use such estimate to run a reverse process. As the reverse process is initialized with the stationary distribution of the forward one, the existing analysis paradigm requires $T_1\to\infty$. This is however problematic: from a theoretical viewpoint, for a given precision of the score approximation, the convergence guarantee fails as $T_1$ diverges; from a practical viewpoint, a large $T_1$ increases computational costs and leads to error propagation. This paper addresses the issue by considering a version of the popular predictor-corrector scheme: after running the forward process, we first estimate the final distribution via an inexact Langevin dynamics and then revert the process. Our key technical contribution is to provide convergence guarantees which require to run the forward process only for a fixed finite time $T_1$. Our bounds exhibit a mild logarithmic dependence on the input dimension and the subgaussian norm of the target distribution, have minimal assumptions on the data, and require only to control the $L^2$ loss on the score approximation, which is the quantity minimized in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical simulation of a time-evolving Schr\"odinger equation inspired by stochastic mechanics and generative diffusion models. Unlike existing approaches, which exhibit computational complexity that scales exponentially in the problem dimension, our method allows us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional structure of the wave function by sampling from the Markovian diffusion. Depending on the latent dimension, our method may have far lower computational complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose novel equations for stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared to other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>ARK: Robust Knockoffs Inference with Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the model-X knockoffs framework with respect to the misspecified or estimated feature distribution. We achieve such a goal by theoretically studying the feature selection performance of a practically implemented knockoffs algorithm, which we name as the approximate knockoffs (ARK) procedure, under the measures of the false discovery rate (FDR) and $k$-familywise error rate ($k$-FWER). The approximate knockoffs procedure differs from the model-X knockoffs procedure only in that the former uses the misspecified or estimated feature distribution. A key technique in our theoretical analyses is to couple the approximate knockoffs procedure with the model-X knockoffs procedure so that random variables in these two procedures can be close in realizations. We prove that if such coupled model-X knockoffs procedure exists, the approximate knockoffs procedure can achieve the asymptotic FDR or $k$-FWER control at the target level. We showcase three specific constructions of such coupled model-X knockoff variables, verifying their existence and justifying the robustness of the model-X knockoffs framework. Additionally, we formally connect our concept of knockoff variable coupling to a type of Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>CONFIDERAI: a novel CONFormal Interpretable-by-Design score function for Explainable and Reliable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Everyday life is increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence, and there is no question that machine learning algorithms must be designed to be reliable and trustworthy for everyone. Specifically, computer scientists consider an artificial intelligence system safe and trustworthy if it fulfills five pillars: explainability, robustness, transparency, fairness, and privacy. In addition to these five, we propose a sixth fundamental aspect: conformity, that is, the probabilistic assurance that the system will behave as the machine learner expects. In this paper, we present a methodology to link conformal prediction with explainable machine learning by defining a new score function for rule-based classifiers that leverages rules predictive ability, the geometrical position of points within rules boundaries and the overlaps among rules as well, thanks to the definition of a geometrical rule similarity term. Furthermore, we address the problem of defining regions in the feature space where conformal guarantees are satisfied, by exploiting the definition of conformal critical set and showing how this set can be used to achieve new rules with improved performance on the target class. The overall methodology is tested with promising results on several datasets of real-world interest, such as domain name server tunneling detection or cardiovascular disease prediction.</description>

      <title>GP+: A Python Library for Kernel-based learning via Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce GP+, an open-source library for kernel-based learning via Gaussian processes (GPs) which are powerful statistical models that are completely characterized by their parametric covariance and mean functions. GP+ is built on PyTorch and provides a user-friendly and object-oriented tool for probabilistic learning and inference. As we demonstrate with a host of examples, GP+ has a few unique advantages over other GP modeling libraries. We achieve these advantages primarily by integrating nonlinear manifold learning techniques with GPs' covariance and mean functions. As part of introducing GP+, in this paper we also make methodological contributions that (1) enable probabilistic data fusion and inverse parameter estimation, and (2) equip GPs with parsimonious parametric mean functions which span mixed feature spaces that have both categorical and quantitative variables. We demonstrate the impact of these contributions in the context of Bayesian optimization, multi-fidelity modeling, sensitivity analysis, and calibration of computer models.</description>

      <title>Isolated pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magnetorotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron star birth properties and their dynamical and magnetorotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from lognormal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic field decay with a power law. Each lognormal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and we produce a large database of synthetic $P$--$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magnetorotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the lognormal distributions and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at the $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step toward robust statistical inference for complex population synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multiwavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Sampling in Unit Time with Kernel Fisher-Rao Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field ODE and corresponding interacting particle systems (IPS) for sampling from an unnormalized target density. The IPS are gradient-free, available in closed form, and only require the ability to sample from a reference density and compute the (unnormalized) target-to-reference density ratio. The mean-field ODE is obtained by solving a Poisson equation for a velocity field that transports samples along the geometric mixture of the two densities, which is the path of a particular Fisher-Rao gradient flow. We employ a RKHS ansatz for the velocity field, which makes the Poisson equation tractable and enables discretization of the resulting mean-field ODE over finite samples. The mean-field ODE can be additionally be derived from a discrete-time perspective as the limit of successive linearizations of the Monge-Amp\`ere equations within a framework known as sample-driven optimal transport. We introduce a stochastic variant of our approach and demonstrate empirically that our IPS can produce high-quality samples from varied target distributions, outperforming comparable gradient-free particle systems and competitive with gradient-based alternatives.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Density Ratios for Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theories of offline and online reinforcement learning, despite having evolved in parallel, have begun to show signs of the possibility for a unification, with algorithms and analysis techniques for one setting often having natural counterparts in the other. However, the notion of density ratio modeling, an emerging paradigm in offline RL, has been largely absent from online RL, perhaps for good reason: the very existence and boundedness of density ratios relies on access to an exploratory dataset with good coverage, but the core challenge in online RL is to collect such a dataset without having one to start. In this work we show -- perhaps surprisingly -- that density ratio-based algorithms have online counterparts. Assuming only the existence of an exploratory distribution with good coverage, a structural condition known as coverability (Xie et al., 2023), we give a new algorithm (GLOW) that uses density ratio realizability and value function realizability to perform sample-efficient online exploration. GLOW addresses unbounded density ratios via careful use of truncation, and combines this with optimism to guide exploration. GLOW is computationally inefficient; we complement it with a more efficient counterpart, HyGLOW, for the Hybrid RL setting (Song et al., 2022) wherein online RL is augmented with additional offline data. HyGLOW is derived as a special case of a more general meta-algorithm that provides a provable black-box reduction from hybrid RL to offline RL, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We present evidence of substantial benefit from efficient exploration in gathering human feedback to improve large language models. In our experiments, an agent sequentially generates queries while fitting a reward model to the feedback received. Our best-performing agent generates queries using double Thompson sampling, with uncertainty represented by an epistemic neural network. Our results demonstrate that efficient exploration enables high levels of performance with far fewer queries. Further, both uncertainty estimation and the choice of exploration scheme play critical roles.</description>

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with a Reject Option</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, one often encounters ambiguously labeled data, where different annotators assign conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions instead. When evaluated without the reject option, our nearest neighbor-based approach also achieves competitive prediction performance.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Approach to Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. We explore unlearning from an information theoretic perspective, connecting the influence of a sample to the information gain a model receives by observing it. From this, we derive a simple but principled zero-shot unlearning method based on the geometry of the model. Our approach takes the form of minimising the gradient of a learned function with respect to a small neighbourhood around a target forget point. This induces a smoothing effect, causing forgetting by moving the boundary of the classifier. We explore the intuition behind why this approach can jointly unlearn forget samples while preserving general model performance through a series of low-dimensional experiments. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Universality of Coupling-based Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the expressive power of normalizing flows. Despite their prevalence in scientific applications, a comprehensive understanding of flows remains elusive due to their restricted architectures. Existing theorems fall short as they require the use of arbitrarily ill-conditioned neural networks, limiting practical applicability. We propose a distributional universality theorem for well-conditioned coupling-based normalizing flows such as RealNVP. In addition, we show that volume-preserving normalizing flows are not universal, what distribution they learn instead, and how to fix their expressivity. Our results support the general wisdom that affine and related couplings are expressive and in general outperform volume-preserving flows, bridging a gap between empirical results and theoretical understanding.</description>

      <title>Robust CLIP: Unsupervised Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Vision Embeddings for Robust Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal foundation models like OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, and GPT-4 are increasingly used for various real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available at https://github.com/chs20/RobustVLM</description>

      <title>How Transformers Learn Diverse Attention Correlations in Masked Vision Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked reconstruction, which predicts randomly masked patches from unmasked ones, has emerged as an important approach in self-supervised pretraining. However, the theoretical understanding of masked pretraining is rather limited, especially for the foundational architecture of transformers. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first end-to-end theoretical guarantee of learning one-layer transformers in masked reconstruction self-supervised pretraining. On the conceptual side, we posit a mechanism of how transformers trained with masked vision pretraining objectives produce empirically observed local and diverse attention patterns, on data distributions with spatial structures that highlight feature-position correlations. On the technical side, our end-to-end characterization of training dynamics in softmax-attention models simultaneously accounts for input and position embeddings, which is developed based on a careful analysis tracking the interplay between feature-wise and position-wise attention correlations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Online Exploration via Coverability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration is a major challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for high-dimensional domains that require function approximation. We propose exploration objectives -- policy optimization objectives that enable downstream maximization of any reward function -- as a conceptual framework to systematize the study of exploration. Within this framework, we introduce a new objective, $L_1$-Coverage, which generalizes previous exploration schemes and supports three fundamental desiderata:
  1. Intrinsic complexity control. $L_1$-Coverage is associated with a structural parameter, $L_1$-Coverability, which reflects the intrinsic statistical difficulty of the underlying MDP, subsuming Block and Low-Rank MDPs.
  2. Efficient planning. For a known MDP, optimizing $L_1$-Coverage efficiently reduces to standard policy optimization, allowing flexible integration with off-the-shelf methods such as policy gradient and Q-learning approaches.
  3. Efficient exploration. $L_1$-Coverage enables the first computationally efficient model-based and model-free algorithms for online (reward-free or reward-driven) reinforcement learning in MDPs with low coverability.
  Empirically, we find that $L_1$-Coverage effectively drives off-the-shelf policy optimization algorithms to explore the state space.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Some Convex Message Passing Algorithms to a Fixed Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular approach to the MAP inference problem in graphical models is to minimize an upper bound obtained from a dual linear programming or Lagrangian relaxation by (block-)coordinate descent. This is also known as convex/convergent message passing; examples are max-sum diffusion and sequential tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S). Convergence properties of these methods are currently not fully understood. They have been proved to converge to the set characterized by local consistency of active constraints, with unknown convergence rate; however, it was not clear if the iterates converge at all (to any point). We prove a stronger result (conjectured before but never proved): the iterates converge to a fixed point of the method. Moreover, we show that the algorithm terminates within $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ iterations. We first prove this for a version of coordinate descent applied to a general piecewise-affine convex objective. Then we show that several convex message passing methods are special cases of this method. Finally, we show that a slightly different version of coordinate descent can cycle.</description>

      <title>Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and General Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. For weakly communicating MDPs, we establish the complexity bound $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{H}{\varepsilon^2} )$, where $H$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,H$, and $\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. We also initiate the study of sample complexity in general (multichain) average-reward MDPs. We argue a new transient time parameter $B$ is necessary, establish an $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{B + H}{\varepsilon^2})$ complexity bound, and prove a matching (up to log factors) minimax lower bound. Both results are based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, which requires new ideas in the general setting. To optimally analyze this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{H}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} )$ and $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{B + H}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} )$ samples suffice to learn $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in weakly communicating and in general MDPs, respectively. Both these results circumvent the well-known minimax lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2} )$ for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, and establish a quadratic rather than cubic horizon dependence for a fixed MDP instance.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Calibration of Long-Form Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) may lead their users to make suboptimal downstream decisions when they confidently hallucinate. This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce long-form text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we define linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as "I estimate a 30% chance of..." or "I am certain that...", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under significant domain shifts to scientific and biomedical questions and to an entirely held-out person biography generation task. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users make in downstream decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimization without Retraction on the Random Generalized Stiefel Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices $X$ that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$, referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving sampled covariance matrices such as the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving these problems is typically done by iterative methods that require a fully formed $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization problem while having access only to a random estimates of $B$. Our method does not enforce the constraint in every iteration; instead, it produces iterations that converge to critical points on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation. The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian optimization counterparts that require the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including CCA, ICA, and the GEVP.</description>

      <title>Conformal Validity Guarantees Exist for Any Data Distribution (and How to Find Them)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) gain widespread adoption, practitioners are increasingly seeking means to quantify and control the risk these systems incur. This challenge is especially salient when such systems have autonomy to collect their own data, such as in black-box optimization and active learning, where their actions induce sequential feedback-loop shifts in the data distribution. Conformal prediction is a promising approach to uncertainty and risk quantification, but prior variants' validity guarantees have assumed some form of ``quasi-exchangeability'' on the data distribution, thereby excluding many types of sequential shifts. In this paper we prove that conformal prediction can theoretically be extended to \textit{any} joint data distribution, not just exchangeable or quasi-exchangeable ones. Although the most general case is exceedingly impractical to compute, for concrete practical applications we outline a procedure for deriving specific conformal algorithms for any data distribution, and we use this procedure to derive tractable algorithms for a series of AI/ML-agent-induced covariate shifts. We evaluate the proposed algorithms empirically on synthetic black-box optimization and active learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Can Implicit Bias Imply Adversarial Robustness?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implicit bias of gradient-based training algorithms has been considered mostly beneficial as it leads to trained networks that often generalize well. However, Frei et al. (2023) show that such implicit bias can harm adversarial robustness. Specifically, they show that if the data consists of clusters with small inter-cluster correlation, a shallow (two-layer) ReLU network trained by gradient flow generalizes well, but it is not robust to adversarial attacks of small radius. Moreover, this phenomenon occurs despite the existence of a much more robust classifier that can be explicitly constructed from a shallow network. In this paper, we extend recent analyses of neuron alignment to show that a shallow network with a polynomial ReLU activation (pReLU) trained by gradient flow not only generalizes well but is also robust to adversarial attacks. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay between data structure and architecture design in the implicit bias and robustness of trained networks.</description>

Abstract: We provide a novel dimension-free uniform concentration bound for the empirical risk function of constrained logistic regression. Our bound yields a milder sufficient condition for a uniform law of large numbers than conditions derived by the Rademacher complexity argument and McDiarmid's inequality. The derivation is based on the PAC-Bayes approach with second-order expansion and Rademacher-complexity-based bounds for the residual term of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both online and offline RLHF methods such as PPO and DPO have been extremely successful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success, the existing methods suffer from a fundamental problem that their optimal solution is highly task-dependent (i.e., not robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks). Here we address this challenge by proposing Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization SRPO, a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework that is completely robust to the changes in the task. The key idea of SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, which can be mathematically expressed in terms of a min-max objective that aims at joint optimization of self-improvement policy and the generative policy in an adversarial fashion. The solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task and thus it is robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be re-expressed in the form of a non-adversarial offline loss which can be optimized using standard supervised optimization techniques at scale without any need for reward model and online inference. We show the effectiveness of SRPO in terms of AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. In particular, when SRPO is evaluated on the OOD XSUM dataset, it outperforms the celebrated DPO by a clear margin of 15% after 5 self-revisions, achieving WR of 90%.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Graph rewiring techniques have been utilised on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve expressiveness and increase model performance. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs. TGR enables communication between temporally distant nodes in a continuous time dynamic graph by utilising expander graph propagation to construct a message passing highway for message passing between distant nodes. Expander graphs are suitable candidates for rewiring as they help overcome the oversquashing problem often observed in GNNs. On the public tgbl-wiki benchmark, we show that TGR improves the performance of a widely used TGN model by a significant margin. Our code repository is accessible at https://github.com/kpetrovicc/TGR.git .</description>
