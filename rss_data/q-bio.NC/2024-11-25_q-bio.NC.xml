      <title>Complexity synchronization analysis of neurophysiological data: Theory and methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA) to assess multifractal dimensions of ON time series (ONTS) and complexity synchronization (CS) analysis to infer information transfer among ONs that are part of a network of organ networks (NoONs). The purpose of this paper is to advance the validation, standardization, and repeatability of MDEA and CS analysis of heterogeneous neurophysiological time series data. Results from processing these datasets show that the complexity of brain, heart, and lung ONTS significantly co-vary over time during cognitive task performance but that certain principles, guidelines, and strategies for the application of MDEA analysis need consideration.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Representational Similarity Measures from the Lens of Functional Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</description>

      <title>Minimizing information loss reduces spiking neuronal networks to differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neuronal networks (SNNs) are widely used in computational neuroscience, from biologically realistic modeling of local cortical networks to phenomenological modeling of the whole brain. Despite their prevalence, a systematic mathematical theory for finite-sized SNNs remains elusive, even for idealized homogeneous networks. The primary challenges are twofold: 1) the rich, parameter-sensitive SNN dynamics, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. These challenges pose significant difficulties when relating SNNs to systems of differential equations, leading previous studies to impose additional assumptions or to focus on individual dynamic regimes. In this study, we introduce a Markov approximation of homogeneous SNN dynamics to minimize information loss when translating SNNs into ordinary differential equations. Our only assumption for the Markov approximation is the fast self-decorrelation of synaptic conductances. The system of ordinary differential equations derived from the Markov model effectively captures high-frequency partial synchrony and the metastability of finite-neuron networks produced by interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations. Besides accurately predicting dynamical statistics, such as firing rates, our theory also quantitatively captures the geometry of attractors and bifurcation structures of SNNs. Thus, our work provides a comprehensive mathematical framework that can systematically map parameters of single-neuron physiology, network coupling, and external stimuli to homogeneous SNN dynamics.</description>

      <title>Functional dissociations versus post-hoc selection: Moving beyond the Stockart et al. (2024) compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stockart et al. (2024) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that are far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.</description>

      <title>Mode-conditioned music learning and composition: a spiking neural network inspired by neuroscience and psychology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musical mode is one of the most critical element that establishes the framework of pitch organization and determines the harmonic relationships. Previous works often use the simplistic and rigid alignment method, and overlook the diversity of modes. However, in contrast to AI models, humans possess cognitive mechanisms for perceiving the various modes and keys. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network inspired by brain mechanisms and psychological theories to represent musical modes and keys, ultimately generating musical pieces that incorporate tonality features. Specifically, the contributions are detailed as follows: 1) The model is designed with multiple collaborated subsystems inspired by the structures and functions of corresponding brain regions; 2)We incorporate mechanisms for neural circuit evolutionary learning that enable the network to learn and generate mode-related features in music, reflecting the cognitive processes involved in human music perception. 3)The results demonstrate that the proposed model shows a connection framework closely similar to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler model, which is one of the most significant key perception models in the music psychology domain. 4) Experiments show that the model can generate music pieces with characteristics of the given modes and keys. Additionally, the quantitative assessments of generated pieces reveals that the generating music pieces have both tonality characteristics and the melodic adaptability needed to generate diverse and musical content. By combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and music theory with advanced neural network architectures, our research aims to create a system that not only learns and generates music but also bridges the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS): Active inference with interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.</description>

      <title>A Joint Network Optimization Framework to Predict Clinical Severity from Resting State Functional MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework to predict clinical severity from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our model consists of two coupled terms. The first term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of representative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks are modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental patterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via patient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear regression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a measure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate datasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second dataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD database. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which employ conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning techniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our joint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI correlation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly identifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.</description>

      <title>NeuroGraph: Benchmarks for Graph Machine Learning in Brain Connectomics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.</description>
