      <title>Vertex-transitive graphs with uniformly bisecting quasi-geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $X$ is an infinite, connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with the property that every bi-infinite quasi-geodesic uniformly coarsely separates $X$ into exactly two deep pieces. We show that such an $X$ is quasi-isometric to either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic plane. In particular, if $X$ is a Cayley graph of a finitely generated group $G$ with the above property, then $G$ is a virtual surface group. This can be interpreted as an extension of the well-known fact that a hyperbolic group with circular boundary is virtually Fuchsian.
  Our theorem positively resolves Problem 14.98 of the Kourovka Notebook, posed by V. A. Churkin in 1999. The proof uses an isoperimetric inequality of Varopoulos to show that if such a graph has the above property, then either it is hyperbolic or has quadratic growth.</description>

      <title>Stable subgroups of graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the characterization of stable subgroups of right-angled Artin groups of Koberda, Mangahas and Taylor to the case of graph products of infinite groups. Specifically, we show that the stable subgroups of such graph products are exactly the subgroups that quasi-isometrically embed in the associated contact graph. Equivalently, they are the subgroups that satisfy a condition arising from the defining graph: a stable subgroup is an almost join-free subgroup. In particular, we recover the equivalence between stable and purely loxodromic subgroups of Koberda, Mangahas and Taylor in the case where all torsion subgroups of the vertex groups are finite.</description>

      <title>Spectral Growth in $W(E_{10})$: Double Coset Filtration and Hilbert Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral radii of elements in the hyperbolic Coxeter group $W(E_{10})$ by introducing a filtration indexed by reflections conjugate to a distinguished simple reflection $s_0$. This filtration organizes $W(E_{10})$ into double cosets relative to the parabolic subgroup $W(A_9)$, and we classify the minimal representatives of these cosets via a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG) labeled by triples. Each node in the DAG corresponds to a structured reflection composition, enabling a recursive understanding of spectral growth. Using the Hilbert metric on the Tits cone, we relate spectral radii to geometric displacement and demonstrate an effective method to compute the spectral radii inductively. This provides a geometric and combinatorial framework for understanding the Weyl spectrum of $W(E_{10})$. While our focus is on $E_{10}$, the techniques developed extended naturally to the family $W(E_n)$ for $n\ge 10$, with implications for dynamics on rational surfaces and entropy spectra of surface automorphisms.</description>

      <title>The Number of Solvabilizers in Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a finite group $G$, for any element $x\in G$, the solvabilizer of $x$ in $G$ is defined as $Sol_G(x)=\{y \in G : \langle x, y \rangle \text{ is solvable}\}$. In this paper, we introduce $Solv(G)$ as the number of distinct solvabilizers of elements in $G$. A group is called $n$-solvabilizer if $|Solv(G)|=n$. We compute $|Solv(G)|$ for various classes of non-abelian simple groups, including $PSL(2, 2^n)$; $PSL(2, 3^n)$ with an odd integer $n$; and $PSL(2, p)$ with a prime $p&gt;7$. Furthermore, we show that for any nonsolvable group $G$, $|Solv(G)|\geq 32$. Finally, we implement an algorithm in GAP for calculating $|Solv(G)|$ for any nonsolvable group $G$. This algorithm can be adapted for all questions generalizing to nilpotent and other subgroup-closed classes of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

      <title>A family of accumulation points of non-free rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $q\in\mathbb{R}$, let $A:=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right), B_q:=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\q &amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and let $G_q:=\langle A,B_q\rangle\leqslant\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Kim and Koberda conjecture that for every $q\in\mathbb{Q}\cap(-4,4)$, the group $G_q$ is not freely generated by these two matrices. We generalize work of Smilga and construct families of $q$ satisfying the conjecture that accumulate at infinitely many different points in $(-4,4)$. We give different constructions of such families, the first coming from applying tools in Diophantine geometry to certain polynomials arising in Smilga's work, the second from sums of geometric series and the last from ratios of Pell and Half-Companion Pell Numbers accumulating at $1+\sqrt{2}$.</description>
