      <title>Systematic Classification of Studies Investigating Social Media Conversations about Long COVID Using a Novel Zero-Shot Transformer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long COVID continues to challenge public health by affecting a considerable number of individuals who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection yet endure prolonged and often debilitating symptoms. Social media has emerged as a vital resource for those seeking real-time information, peer support, and validating their health concerns related to Long COVID. This paper examines recent works focusing on mining, analyzing, and interpreting user-generated content on social media platforms to capture the broader discourse on persistent post-COVID conditions. A novel transformer-based zero-shot learning approach serves as the foundation for classifying research papers in this area into four primary categories: Clinical or Symptom Characterization, Advanced NLP or Computational Methods, Policy Advocacy or Public Health Communication, and Online Communities and Social Support. This methodology achieved an average confidence of 0.7788, with the minimum and maximum confidence being 0.1566 and 0.9928, respectively. This model showcases the ability of advanced language models to categorize research papers without any training data or predefined classification labels, thus enabling a more rapid and scalable assessment of existing literature. This paper also highlights the multifaceted nature of Long COVID research by demonstrating how advanced computational techniques applied to social media conversations can reveal deeper insights into the experiences, symptoms, and narratives of individuals affected by Long COVID.</description>

      <title>Weighted cycle-based identification of influential node groups in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential node groups in complex networks is crucial for optimizing information dissemination, epidemic control, and viral marketing. However, traditional centrality-based methods often focus on individual nodes, resulting in overlapping influence zones and diminished collective effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Weighted Cycle (WCycle), a novel indicator that incorporates basic cycle structures and node behavior traits (edge weights) to comprehensively assess node importance. WCycle effectively identifies spatially dispersed and structurally diverse key node group, thereby reducing influence redundancy and enhancing network-wide propagation. Extensive experiments on six real-world networks demonstrate WCycle's superior performance compared to five benchmark methods across multiple evaluation dimensions, including influence propagation efficiency, structural differentiation, and cost-effectiveness. The findings highlight WCycle's robustness and scalability, establishing it as a promising tool for complex network analysis and practical applications requiring effective influence maximization.</description>

      <title>A Mechanistic Study on the Impact of Entity Degree Distribution in Open-World Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-world link prediction supports the knowledge representation and link prediction of new entities, enhancing the practical value of knowledge graphs in real-world applications. However, as research deepens, the performance improvements in open-world link prediction have gradually reached a bottleneck. Understanding its intrinsic impact mechanisms is crucial for identifying the key factors that limit performance, offering new theoretical insights and optimization strategies to overcome these bottlenecks. This study focuses on entity degree distribution, a core structural feature of knowledge graphs, and investigates its impact on the performance of open-world link prediction tasks. First, through experimental analysis, we confirm that entity degree distribution significantly affects link prediction model performance. Second, we reveal a strong positive correlation between entity degree and link prediction accuracy. Moreover, this study explores how entity degree influences embedding space distribution and weight updates during neural network training, uncovering the deeper mechanisms affecting open-world link prediction performance. The findings show that entity degree distribution has a significant impact on model training. By influencing the quality of the embedding space and weight updates, it indirectly affects the overall prediction performance of the model. In summary, this study not only highlights the critical role of entity degree distribution in open-world link prediction but also uncovers the intrinsic mechanisms through which it impacts model performance, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Conversation-Based Multimodal Abuse Detection Through Text and Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abusive behavior is common on online social networks, and forces the hosts of such platforms to find new solutions to address this problem. Various methods have been proposed to automate this task in the past decade. Most of them rely on the exchanged content, but ignore the structure and dynamics of the conversation, which could provide some relevant information. In this article, we propose to use representation learning methods to automatically produce embeddings of this textual content and of the conversational graphs depicting message exchanges. While the latter could be enhanced by including additional information on top of the raw conversational structure, no method currently exists to learn wholegraph representations using simultaneously edge directions, weights, signs, and vertex attributes. We propose two such methods to fill this gap in the literature. We experiment with 5 textual and 13 graph embedding methods, and apply them to a dataset of online messages annotated for abuse detection. Our best results achieve an F -measure of 81.02 using text alone and 80.61 using graphs alone. We also combine both modalities of information (text and graphs) through three fusion strategies, and show that this strongly improves abuse detection performance, increasing the F -measure to 87.06. Finally, we identify which specific engineered features are captured by the embedding methods under consideration. These features have clear interpretations and help explain what information the representation learning methods deem discriminative.</description>

      <title>PRE-Share Data: Assistance Tool for Resource-aware Designing of Data-sharing Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is a valuable asset, and sharing it as a product across organizations is key to building comprehensive and useful insights in fields such as science and industry. Before sharing, data often requires transformation to comply with governance policies and meet the requirements of recipient organizations. By leveraging pipelines, these transformations can be modeled as chains of processes; however, designing such pipelines while ensuring their efficiency is complex. In this paper, we present a tool that supports the design of pipelines by identifying opportunities for reusing transformation processes across different pipelines and suggesting designs and configurations based on these opportunities. This tool also generates reports on the resource consumption of pipeline processes, enabling the estimation of potential resource savings achievable through reuse-based designs. It could serve as a foundation for more efficient and resource-conscious data transformation pipeline design and be used as a component in self-service data platforms.</description>

      <title>Invisible Labor: The Backbone of Open Source Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invisible labor is an intrinsic part of the modern workplace, and includes labor that is undervalued or unrecognized such as creating collaborative atmospheres. Open source software (OSS) is software that is viewable, editable and shareable by anyone with internet access. Contributors are mostly volunteers, who participate for personal edification and because they believe in the spirit of OSS rather than for employment. Volunteerism often leads to high personnel turnover, poor maintenance and inconsistent project management. This in turn, leads to a difficulty with sustainability long term. We believe that the key to sustainable management is the invisible labor that occurs behind the scenes. It is unclear how OSS contributors think about the invisible labor they perform or how that affects OSS sustainability. We interviewed OSS contributors and asked them about their invisible labor contributions, leadership departure, membership turnover and sustainability. We found that invisible labor is responsible for good leadership, reducing contributor turnover, and creating legitimacy for the project as an organization.</description>

      <title>Seeing Sarcasm Through Different Eyes: Analyzing Multimodal Sarcasm Perception in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

      <title>Decentralized Hidden Markov Modeling with Equal Exit Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social learning strategies enable agents to infer the underlying true state of nature in a distributed manner by receiving private environmental signals and exchanging beliefs with their neighbors. Previous studies have extensively focused on static environments, where the underlying true state remains unchanged over time. In this paper, we consider a dynamic setting where the true state evolves according to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. Based on this assumption, we present a social learning strategy for dynamic environments, termed Diffusion $\alpha$-HMM. By leveraging a simplified parameterization, we derive a nonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio over time. This formulation further reveals the relationship between the linearized form of Diffusion $\alpha$-HMM and Adaptive Social Learning, a well-established social learning strategy for dynamic environments. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and fixed-point properties of a reference system, providing theoretical guarantees on the learning performance of the proposed algorithm in dynamic settings. Numerical experiments compare various distributed social learning strategies across different dynamic environments, demonstrating the impact of nonlinearity and parameterization on learning performance in a range of dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>The "recognition," "belief," and "action" regarding conspiracy theories: An empirical study using large-scale samples from Japan and the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories present significant societal challenges, shaping political behavior, eroding public trust, and disrupting social cohesion. Addressing their impact requires recognizing that conspiracy engagement is not a singular act but a multi-stage process involving distinct cognitive and behavioral transitions. In this study, we investigate this sequential progression, "recognition," "belief," and "action" (demonstrative action and diffusion action), using nationally representative surveys from the United States (N=13,578) and Japan (N=16,693). Applying a Bayesian hierarchical model, we identify the key social, political, and economic factors that drive engagement at each stage, providing a structured framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying conspiracy theory adoption and dissemination. We find that recognition serves as a crucial gateway determining who transitions to belief, and that demonstrative and diffusion actions are shaped by distinct factors. Demonstrative actions are more prevalent among younger, higher-status individuals with strong political alignments, whereas diffusion actions occur across broader demographics, particularly among those engaged with diverse media channels. Our findings further reveal that early-life economic and cultural capital significantly influence the shape of conspiratorial engagement, emphasizing the role of life-course experiences. These insights highlight the necessity of distinguishing between different forms of conspiracy engagement and highlight the importance of targeted interventions that account for structural, cultural, and psychological factors to mitigate their spread and societal impact.</description>

      <title>Agentic Search Engine for Real-Time IoT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled diverse devices to communicate over the Internet, yet the fragmentation of IoT systems limits seamless data sharing and coordinated management. We have recently introduced SensorsConnect, a unified framework to enable seamless content and sensor data sharing in collaborative IoT systems, inspired by how the World Wide Web (WWW) enabled a shared and accessible space for information among humans. This paper presents the IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE), a real-time search engine tailored for IoT environments. IoT-ASE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to address the challenge of searching vast, real-time IoT data, enabling it to handle complex queries and deliver accurate, contextually relevant results. We implemented a use-case scenario in Toronto to demonstrate how IoT-ASE can improve service quality recommendations by leveraging real-time IoT data. Our evaluation shows that IoT-ASE achieves a 92\% accuracy in retrieving intent-based services and produces responses that are concise, relevant, and context-aware, outperforming generalized responses from systems like Gemini. These findings highlight the potential IoT-ASE to make real-time IoT data accessible and support effective, real-time decision-making.</description>

      <title>Understanding Driver Cognition and Decision-Making Behaviors in High-Risk Scenarios: A Drift Diffusion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human drivers in mixed traffic systems remains a major challenge, particularly in complex, high-risk scenarios. This paper presents a cognition-decision framework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver behavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a risk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a cognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is introduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk environments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating initial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in speed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving styles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral, longitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the proposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors during emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk sensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters, allowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more precisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in high-risk scenarios. These findings provide a theoretical basis for modeling human driving behavior and offer critical insights for enhancing AV-human interaction in real-world traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Similarity-Driven Weighting by Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LRL) holds significant potential for addressing sequential tasks, but it still faces considerable challenges. A key difficulty lies in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer while maintaining reliable decision-making performance across subsequent tasks in dynamic environments. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework, SDW (Similarity-Driven Weighting Framework), which leverages large-language-model-generated dynamic functions to precisely control the training process. The core of SDW lies in two functions pre-generated by large models: the task similarity function and the weight computation function. The task similarity function extracts multidimensional features from task descriptions to quantify the similarities and differences between tasks in terms of states, actions, and rewards. The weight computation function dynamically generates critical training parameters based on the similarity information, including the proportion of old task data stored in the Replay Buffer and the strategy consistency weight in the loss function, enabling an adaptive balance between learning new tasks and transferring knowledge from previous tasks. By generating function code offline prior to training, rather than relying on large-model inference during the training process, the SDW framework reduces computational overhead while maintaining efficiency in sequential task scenarios. Experimental results on Atari and MiniHack sequential tasks demonstrate that SDW significantly outperforms existing lifelong reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</description>

      <title>Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arab Spring is a major socio-political movement that reshaped democratic aspirations in the Middle East and North Africa, attracting global attention through news, social media, and academic discourse. However, its consequences on the academic landscape in the region are still unclear. Here, we conduct the first study of scholarly attention toward 10 target countries affected by the Arab Spring by analyzing more than 25 million articles published from 2002 to 2019. We find that changes in scholarly attention were unevenly distributed among target countries, with Egypt attracting the most attention. We reveal strong correlations between increases in scholarly attention given by source countries and increases in funding for research about the target countries as well as increased immigration of scholars from the affected region to them. Notably, our analysis reveals Saudi Arabia's positioning as a key player, among Western nations, that shapes research in the region.</description>

      <title>Visually Wired NFTs: Exploring the Role of Inspiration in Non-Fungible Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fervor for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) attracted countless creators, leading to a Big Bang of digital assets driven by latent or explicit forms of inspiration, as in many creative processes. This work exploits Vision Transformers and graph-based modeling to delve into visual inspiration phenomena between NFTs over the years. Our goals include unveiling the main structural traits that shape visual inspiration networks, exploring the interrelation between visual inspiration and asset performances, investigating crypto influence on inspiration processes, and explaining the inspiration relationships among NFTs. Our findings unveil how the pervasiveness of inspiration led to a temporary saturation of the visual feature space, the impact of the dichotomy between inspiring and inspired NFTs on their financial performance, and an intrinsic self-regulatory mechanism between markets and inspiration waves. Our work can serve as a starting point for gaining a broader view of the evolution of Web3.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Comparison Between Independent Cascade and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cascades in social networks with the independent cascade (IC) model and the Susceptible-Infected-recovered (SIR) model. The well-studied IC model fails to capture the feature of node recovery, and the SIR model is a variant of the IC model with the node recovery feature. In the SIR model, by computing the probability that a node successfully infects another before its recovery and viewing this probability as the corresponding IC parameter, the SIR model becomes an "out-going-edge-correlated" version of the IC model: the events of the infections along different out-going edges of a node become dependent in the SIR model, whereas these events are independent in the IC model. In this paper, we thoroughly compare the two models and examine the effect of this extra dependency in the SIR model. By a carefully designed coupling argument, we show that the seeds in the IC model have a stronger influence spread than their counterparts in the SIR model, and sometimes it can be significantly stronger. Specifically, we prove that, given the same network, the same seed sets, and the parameters of the two models being set based on the above-mentioned equivalence, the expected number of infected nodes at the end of the cascade for the IC model is weakly larger than that for the SIR model, and there are instances where this dominance is significant. We also study the influence maximization problem with the SIR model. We show that the above-mentioned difference in the two models yields different seed-selection strategies, which motivates the design of influence maximization algorithms specifically for the SIR model. We design efficient approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees by adapting the reverse-reachable-set-based algorithms, commonly used for the IC model, to the SIR model. Finally, we conduct experimental studies over real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Topic-wise Exploration of the Telegram Group-verse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Telegram is currently one of the most popular instant messaging apps in the world, previous studies have mainly focused on analysing discussions on specific angles and topics. In this paper, we present a broad analysis of publicly accessible groups that cover a wide range of discussions, including Education, Erotic, Politics, and Cryptocurrencies. How do people interact with different topic groups? Is there any common or peculiar behaviour? We engineer and offer an open-source tool to automate the collection of messages from Telegram groups, a non-straightforward problem. We use it to collect more than 51 million messages from 669 groups. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind, per-topic analysis, contrasting the users' activity patterns from different angles -- the language, the presence of bots, the type and volume of shared media content, links to external platforms, etc. Our results confirm some anecdotal evidence, e.g., indications of spamming behaviour, and unveil some unexpected findings, e.g., the different sharing patterns of video and message length in groups of different topics. Our research provides a horizontal analysis of the public group in Telegram across various general topics, establishing a foundation for future studies that can delve deeper into user interactions and content dynamics within this unique messaging environment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Collective Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In various work contexts, such as meeting scheduling, collaborating, and project planning, collective decision-making is essential but often challenging due to diverse individual preferences, varying work focuses, and power dynamics among members. To address this, we propose a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate group decision-making by managing conversations and balancing preferences among individuals. Our system aims to extract individual preferences from each member's conversation with the system and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study. Our results indicate efficient coordination with reduced interactions between the members and the LLM-based system. The system refines and improves its proposed options over time, ensuring that many of the members' individual preferences are satisfied in an equitable way. Finally, we conduct a survey study involving human participants to assess our system's ability to aggregate preferences and reasoning about them. Our findings show that the system exhibits strong performance in both dimensions.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how individual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive interactions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the type of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model achieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or negative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to (iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and justify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not necessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency, stability, and diversity than the smaller ones.</description>

      <title>AI Rules? Characterizing Reddit Community Policies Towards AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How are Reddit communities responding to AI-generated content? We explored this question through a large-scale analysis of subreddit community rules and their change over time. We collected the metadata and community rules for over $300,000$ public subreddits and measured the prevalence of rules governing AI. We labeled subreddits and AI rules according to existing taxonomies from the HCI literature and a new taxonomy we developed specific to AI rules. While rules about AI are still relatively uncommon, the number of subreddits with these rules more than doubled over the course of a year. AI rules are more common in larger subreddits and communities focused on art or celebrity topics, and less common in those focused on social support. These rules often focus on AI images and evoke, as justification, concerns about quality and authenticity. Overall, our findings illustrate the emergence of varied concerns about AI, in different community contexts. Platform designers and HCI researchers should heed these concerns if they hope to encourage community self-determination in the age of generative AI. We make our datasets public to enable future large-scale studies of community self-governance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Joint Predictive Embedding and Bayesian Inference in Graph Self Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.
