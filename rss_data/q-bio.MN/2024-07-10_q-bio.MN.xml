      <title>Flexibility in noisy cell-to-cell information dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange of molecules allows cells to exchange information. How robust is the information to changes in cell parameters? We use a mapping between the stochastic dynamics of two cells sharing a stimulatory molecule, and parameters akin to an extension of Landau's equilibrium phase transition theory. We show that different single-cell dynamics lead to the same dynamical response -- a flexibility that cells can use. The companion equilibrium Landau model behaves similarly, thereby describing the dynamics of information in a broad class of models with coupled order parameters.</description>

      <title>A hybrid tau-leap for simulating chemical kinetics with applications to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently simulating stochastic models of chemical kinetics. The Gillespie Stochastic Simulation algorithm (SSA) is often used to simulate these models, however, in many scenarios of interest, the computational cost quickly becomes prohibitive. This is further exasperated in the Bayesian inference context when estimating parameters of chemical models, as the intractability of the likelihood requires multiple simulations of the underlying system. To deal with issues of computational complexity in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid $\tau$-leap algorithm for simulating well-mixed chemical systems. In particular, the algorithm uses $\tau$-leap when appropriate (high population densities), and SSA when necessary (low population densities, when discrete effects become non-negligible). In the intermediate regime, a combination of the two methods, which leverages the properties of the underlying Poisson formulation, is employed. As illustrated through a number of numerical experiments the hybrid $\tau$ offers significant computational savings when compared to SSA without however sacrificing the overall accuracy. This feature is particularly welcomed in the Bayesian inference context, as it allows for parameter estimation of stochastic chemical kinetics at reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in the chemosensory array reveals mechanisms for dissipation-enhanced cooperative sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Escherichia coli chemoreceptors form an extensive array that achieves cooperative and adaptive sensing of extracellular signals. The receptors control the activity of histidine kinase CheA, which drives a nonequilibrium phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle for response regulator CheY. Cooperativity and dissipation are both important aspects of chemotaxis signaling, yet their consequences have only been studied separately. Recent single-cell FRET measurements revealed that kinase activity of the array spontaneously switches between active and inactive states, with asymmetric switching times that signify time-reversal symmetry breaking in the underlying dynamics. Here, we present a nonequilibrium lattice model of the chemosensory array, which demonstrates that the observed asymmetric switching dynamics can only be explained by an interplay between the dissipative reactions within individual core units and the cooperative coupling between neighboring units. Microscopically, the switching time asymmetry originates from irreversible transition paths. The model shows that strong dissipation enables sensitive and rapid signaling response by relieving the speed-sensitivity trade-off, which can be tested by future single-cell experiments. Overall, our model provides a general framework for studying biological complexes composed of coupled subunits that are individually driven by dissipative cycles and the rich nonequilibrium physics within.</description>
