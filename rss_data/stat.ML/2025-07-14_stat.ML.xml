      <title>Mallows Model with Learned Distance Metrics: Sampling and Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and voting to aligning language models with human preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic, rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta \cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta &gt; 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$ distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances: $d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta&gt;0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are $\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically using datasets from sports rankings.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Calibrated Learning for Epistemic and Aleatoric Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training. BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances, respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>MIRRAMS: Towards Training Models Robust to Missingness Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Practical Batched Linear Bandit Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches. Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus, \texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.</description>

      <title>Data Depth as a Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth. Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of "loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility background pressures. The model, consisting of a cathode model, discharge model, and plume model, is used to simulate two thrusters across a range of background pressures in multiple vacuum test facilities. The model outputs include thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster, the H9, and an unshielded thruster, the SPT-100. After calibration, the model captures several key performance trends with background pressure, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and the model can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range. Evaluated on the same data as prior work [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9\%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. Possible extensions and improvements are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling across vacuum facilities.</description>

      <title>Entity-Specific Cyber Risk Assessment using InsurTech Empowered Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective, potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent, entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.</description>

      <title>Data Generation without Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be leveraged to develop novel generative methods.</description>

      <title>Improving gravitational wave search sensitivity with TIER: Trigger Inference using Extended strain Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically, search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) ranges.</description>

      <title>Effective regions and kernels in continuous sparse regularisation, with application to sketched mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advances the general theory of continuous sparse regularisation on measures with the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO). This TV-regularized convex program on the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy observation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have uncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in order to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local positive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In practice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved. At the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the model kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known LPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding conditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list of LPC-kernels, proving that the "sinc-4" kernel, used for signal recovery and mixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show that the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the noise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results where this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel. We illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant mixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques to reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Risks in Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data. While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution. Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution shift types, and TTA methods.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Interplay between Carryover Effects and Reward Autocorrelations in Switchback Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A/B testing has become the gold standard for policy evaluation in modern technological industries. Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.</description>

      <title>Local Flow Matching Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is a simulation-free method for learning a continuous and invertible flow to interpolate between two distributions, and in particular to generate data from noise. Inspired by the variational nature of the diffusion process as a gradient flow, we introduce a stepwise FM model called Local Flow Matching (LFM), which consecutively learns a sequence of FM sub-models, each matching a diffusion process up to the time of the step size in the data-to-noise direction. In each step, the two distributions to be interpolated by the sub-flow model are closer to each other than data vs. noise, and this enables the use of smaller models with faster training. This variational perspective also allows us to theoretically prove a generation guarantee of the proposed flow model in terms of the $\chi^2$-divergence between the generated and true data distributions, utilizing the contraction property of the diffusion process. In practice, the stepwise structure of LFM is natural to be distilled and different distillation techniques can be adopted to speed up generation. We empirically demonstrate improved training efficiency and competitive generative performance of LFM compared to FM on the unconditional generation of tabular data and image datasets, and also on the conditional generation of robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>Local transfer learning Gaussian process modeling, with applications to surrogate modeling of expensive computer simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of computer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing solution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to emulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored inputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems. For example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on turbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from such ``source'' systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on the ``target'' system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. Such a ``local transfer'' property is present in many scientific systems: at certain parameters, systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can temper the risk of ``negative transfer'', i.e., the risk of worsening predictive performance from information transfer. We derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian process limit of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a nonparametric Bayesian regression technique of rising fame. It is a sum-of-decision-trees model, and is in some sense the Bayesian version of boosting. In the limit of infinite trees, it becomes equivalent to Gaussian process (GP) regression. This limit is known but has not yet led to any useful analysis or application. For the first time, I derive and compute the exact BART prior covariance function. With it I implement the infinite trees limit of BART as GP regression. Through empirical tests, I show that this limit is worse than standard BART in a fixed configuration, but also that tuning its hyperparameters in the natural GP way makes it competitive with BART. The advantage of using a GP surrogate of BART is the analytical likelihood, which simplifies model building and sidesteps the complex BART MCMC algorithm. More generally, this study opens new ways to understand and develop BART and GP regression. The implementation of BART as GP is available in the Python package lsqfitgp.</description>

      <title>Conditional regression for the Nonlinear Single-Variable Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regressing a function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ without the statistical and computational curse of dimensionality requires special statistical models, for example that impose geometric assumptions on the distribution of the data (e.g., that its support is low-dimensional), or strong smoothness assumptions on $F$, or a special structure $F$. Among the latter, compositional models $F=f\circ g$ with $g$ mapping to $\mathbb{R}^r$ with $r\ll d$ include classical single- and multi-index models, as well as neural networks. While the case where $g$ is linear is well-understood, less is known when $g$ is nonlinear, and in particular for which $g$'s the curse of dimensionality in estimating $F$, or both $f$ and $g$, may be circumvented. Here we consider a model $F(X):=f(\Pi_\gamma X)$ where $\Pi_\gamma:\mathbb{R}^d\to[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]$ is the closest-point projection onto the parameter of a regular curve $\gamma:[0, \textrm{len}_\gamma]\to\mathbb{R}^d$, and $f:[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]\to \mathbb{R}^1$. The input data $X$ is not low-dimensional: it can be as far from $\gamma$ as the condition that $\Pi_\gamma(X)$ is well-defined allows. The distribution $X$, the curve $\gamma$ and the function $f$ are all unknown. This model is a natural nonlinear generalization of the single-index model, corresponding to $\gamma$ being a line. We propose a nonparametric estimator, based on conditional regression, that under suitable assumptions, the strongest of which being that $f$ is coarsely monotone, achieves, up to log factors, the $\textit{one-dimensional}$ optimal min-max rate for non-parametric regression, up to the level of noise in the observations, and be constructed in time $\mathcal{O}(d^2 n\log n)$. All the constants in the learning bounds, in the minimal number of samples required for our bounds to hold, and in the computational complexity are at most low-order polynomials in $d$.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Multiaccuracy and Multicalibration via Proxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the use of predictive machine learning algorithms increases in high-stakes decision-making, it is imperative that these algorithms are fair across sensitive groups. However, measuring and enforcing fairness in real-world applications can be challenging due to the missing or incomplete sensitive group information. Proxy-sensitive attributes have been proposed as a practical and effective solution in these settings, but only for parity-based fairness notions. Knowing how to evaluate and control for fairness with missing sensitive group data for newer, different, and more flexible frameworks, such as multiaccuracy and multicalibration, remain unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that in the absence of sensitive group data, proxy-sensitive attributes can provably used to derive actionable upper bounds on the true multiaccuracy and multicalibration violations, providing insights into a predictive model's potential worst-case fairness violations. Additionally, we show that adjusting models to satisfy multiaccuracy and multicalibration across proxy-sensitive attributes can significantly mitigate these violations for the true, but unknown, sensitive groups. Through several experiments on real-world datasets, we illustrate that approximate multiaccuracy and multicalibration can be achieved even when sensitive group data is incomplete or unavailable.</description>

      <title>Leveraging priors on distribution functions for multi-arm bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Dirichlet Process Posterior Sampling (DPPS), a Bayesian non-parametric algorithm for multi-arm bandits based on Dirichlet Process (DP) priors. Like Thompson-sampling, DPPS is a probability-matching algorithm, i.e., it plays an arm based on its posterior-probability of being optimal. Instead of assuming a parametric class for the reward generating distribution of each arm, and then putting a prior on the parameters, in DPPS the reward generating distribution is directly modeled using DP priors. DPPS provides a principled approach to incorporate prior belief about the bandit environment, and in the noninformative limit of the DP posteriors (i.e. Bayesian Bootstrap), we recover Non Parametric Thompson Sampling (NPTS), a popular non-parametric bandit algorithm, as a special case of DPPS. We employ stick-breaking representation of the DP priors, and show excellent empirical performance of DPPS in challenging synthetic and real world bandit environments. Finally, using an information-theoretic analysis, we show non-asymptotic optimality of DPPS in the Bayesian regret setup.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Galerkin-ARIMA: A Two-Stage Polynomial Regression Framework for Fast Rolling One-Step-Ahead Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Galerkin-ARIMA, a novel time-series forecasting framework that integrates Galerkin projection techniques with the classical ARIMA model to capture potentially nonlinear dependencies in lagged observations. By replacing the fixed linear autoregressive component with a spline-based basis expansion, Galerkin-ARIMA flexibly approximates the underlying relationship among past values via ordinary least squares, while retaining the moving-average structure and Gaussian innovation assumptions of ARIMA. We derive closed-form solutions for both the AR and MA components using two-stage Galerkin projections, establish conditions for asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency, and analyze the bias-variance trade-off under basis-size growth. Complexity analysis reveals that, for moderate basis dimensions, our approach can substantially reduce computational cost compared to maximum-likelihood ARIMA estimation. Through extensive simulations on four synthetic processes-including noisy ARMA, seasonal, trend-AR, and nonlinear recursion series-we demonstrate that Galerkin-ARIMA matches or closely approximates ARIMA's forecasting accuracy while achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups in rolling forecasting tasks. These results suggest that Galerkin-ARIMA offers a powerful, efficient alternative for modeling complex time series dynamics in high-volume or real-time applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usage of machine learning methods in traditional surveys including official statistics, is still very limited. Therefore, we propose a predictor supported by these algorithms, which can be used to predict any population or subpopulation characteristics. Machine learning methods have already been shown to be very powerful in identifying and modelling complex and nonlinear relationships between the variables, which means they have very good properties in case of strong departures from the classic assumptions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of our proposal under a different set-up, which, in our opinion, is of greater importance in real-life surveys. We study only small departures from the assumed model to show that our proposal is a good alternative, even in comparison with optimal methods under the model. Moreover, we propose the method of the ex ante accuracy estimation of machine learning predictors, giving the possibility of the accuracy comparison with classic methods. The solution to this problem is indicated in the literature as one of the key issues in integrating these approaches. The simulation studies are based on a real, longitudinal dataset, where the prediction of subpopulation characteristics is considered.</description>

Abstract: Nonparametric estimation using uniform-width binning is a standard approach for evaluating the calibration performance of machine learning models. However, existing theoretical analyses of the bias induced by binning are limited to binary classification, creating a significant gap with practical applications such as multiclass classification. Additionally, many parametric recalibration algorithms lack theoretical guarantees for their generalization performance. To address these issues, we conduct a generalization analysis of calibration error using the probably approximately correct Bayes framework. This approach enables us to derive the first optimizable upper bound for generalization error in the calibration context. On the basis of our theory, we propose a generalization-aware recalibration algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm enhances the performance of Gaussian process-based recalibration across various benchmark datasets and models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Autoencoders are a neural network architecture that imposes orthogonality conditions between the gradients of latent variables to obtain disentangled representations of data. In this work we show that orthogonality relations within the latent layer of the network can be leveraged to infer the intrinsic dimensionality of nonlinear manifold data sets (locally characterized by the dimension of their tangent space), while simultaneously computing encoding and decoding (embedding) maps. We outline the relevant theory relying on differential geometry, and describe the corresponding gradient-descent optimization algorithm. The method is applied to several data sets and we highlight its applicability, advantages, and shortcomings. In addition, we demonstrate that the same computational technology can be used to build coordinate invariance to local group actions when defined only on a (reduced) submanifold of the embedding space.</description>

      <title>Data-driven system identification using quadratic embeddings of nonlinear dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven method called QENDy (Quadratic Embedding of Nonlinear Dynamics) that not only allows us to learn quadratic representations of highly nonlinear dynamical systems, but also to identify the governing equations. The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>The Value of Prediction in Identifying the Worst-Off</title>

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in government programs to identify and support the most vulnerable individuals, prioritizing assistance for those at greatest risk over optimizing aggregate outcomes. This paper examines the welfare impacts of prediction in equity-driven contexts, and how they compare to other policy levers, such as expanding bureaucratic capacity. Through mathematical models and a real-world case study on long-term unemployment amongst German residents, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness of prediction in surfacing the worst-off. Our findings provide clear analytical frameworks and practical, data-driven tools that empower policymakers to make principled decisions when designing these systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Approximate Gaussian Inference in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classification tasks, softmax functions are ubiquitously used as output activations to produce predictive probabilities. Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling. We evaluate it combined with several approximate Gaussian inference methods (Laplace, HET, SNGP) on large- and small-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10), demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification capabilities compared to softmax MC sampling.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Distributional Robustness in Principal Component Analysis by Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model of principal component analysis (PCA) to account for uncertainty in the underlying probability distribution. The resulting formulation leads to a nonsmooth constrained min-max optimization problem, where the ambiguity set captures the distributional uncertainty by the type-$2$ Wasserstein distance. We prove that the inner maximization problem admits a closed-form optimal value. This explicit characterization equivalently reformulates the original DRO model into a minimization problem on the Stiefel manifold with intricate nonsmooth terms, a challenging formulation beyond the reach of existing algorithms. To address this issue, we devise an efficient smoothing manifold proximal gradient algorithm. Our analysis establishes Riemannian gradient consistency and global convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point of the nonsmooth minimization problem. We also provide the iteration complexity $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ of our algorithm to achieve an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm, as well as to highlight the necessity and rationality of adopting the DRO model for PCA.</description>

      <title>On learning functions over biological sequence space: relating Gaussian process priors, regularization, and gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing," i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.</description>

      <title>Grokking Beyond the Euclidean Norm of Model Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking. This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the $\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any other hyperparameter fixed.</description>

      <title>Alternating Gradient Flows: A Theory of Feature Learning in Two-layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks.</description>
