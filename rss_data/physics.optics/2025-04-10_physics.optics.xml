      <title>Interferometric modal splitting enables a broadband, dual-polarization on-chip spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modal dispersion of waveguides often limits integrated photonic devices to operation with a single polarization state. This presents a challenge for sensing and spectroscopy applications, which often require polarization diversity over wide bandwidths with high throughput. Here, we show that an unmodified thermally-driven silicon photonic Fourier transform spectrometer exhibits a polarization-separating effect in the frequency domain, even though only one polarization-insensitive detector is used. Using this effect, we experimentally demonstrate a simple on-chip spectrometer capable of extracting two-polarization spectra over a wide 1480-1630 nm bandwidth with a greater than 20 dB polarization extinction ratio. These specifications would be highly challenging to achieve using existing, conventional on-chip polarization-splitting techniques. We additionally demonstrate several improvements in calibration and testing that improve the performance of on-chip Fourier transform spectrometers even in the single-polarization case. The "interferometric modal splitting" principle which this spectrometer exemplifies is general to various on-chip spectrometer architectures, other spatial modes, and technologies other than thermally-driven Fourier transform spectrometers. Interferometric mode splitting shows promise as a general approach for robust and fundamentally broadband detection of orthogonal modes in guided-wave sensing.</description>

      <title>Suspended Z-cut lithium niobate waveguides for stimulated Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has recently been demonstrated in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), an emerging material platform for integrated photonics offering large electro-optic and nonlinear properties. While previous work on SBS in TFLN have focused on surface SBS, in this contribution we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, backward intra-modal SBS generation in suspended Z-cut TFLN waveguides. Our results show trapping of multiple acoustic modes in this structure, featuring a multi-peak Brillouin gain spectrum due to the excitation of higher-order acoustic modes. The findings expand the TFLN waveguide platform exploration for SBS interactions and provide a crucial step towards realizing optical processors for microwave signals or sensors integrated on TFLN.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Drude dipoles in the radiative limit and their modeling in finite-difference time-domain methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz-Drude model for electric dipoles is a classical framework widely used in the study of dipole dynamics and light-matter interactions. Here we focus on the behaviors of Lorentz-Drude dipoles when their radiative rate dominates their energy loss. We show that dipole radiation losses do not count toward phenomenological dipole losses if the driving field is interpreted as the total field at the dipole. In particular, if the dipole does not contain non-radiative losses, then the Lorentz-Drude damping term should be removed. This is verified by self-consistent implementations of point dipoles in finite-difference time-domain simulations, which also provide a method to directly compute the transport properties of light when dipoles are present.</description>

      <title>Vortex droplets and lattice patterns in two-dimensional traps: A photonic spin-orbit-coupling perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the mean-field exciton-polariton (EP) theory with balanced loss and pump, we investigate the formation of lattice structures built of individual vortex-antivortex (VAV) bound states under the action of the two-dimensional harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential trap and effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC), produced by the TE-TM splitting in the polariton system. The number of VAV elements (pixels) building the structures grow with the increase of self- and cross-interaction coefficients. Depending upon their values and the trapping frequency, stable ring-shaped, circular, square-shaped, rectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, and triangular patterns are produced, with the central site left vacant or occupied in the lattice patterns of different types. The results suggest the experimental creation of the new patterns and their possible use for the design of integrated circuits in EP setups, controlled by the strengths of the TE-TM splitting, nonlinearity, and HO trap.</description>

      <title>Narwhal-shaped Wavefunctions Enabling Three-dimensional Sub-diffraction-limited Dielectric Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field localization, characterized by mode volume, is central to optics, photonics, and all light-matter interactions. Smaller mode volumes amplify the electric field per photon, enhancing spontaneous emission, strengthening nonlinear optical effects, and enabling strong coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics. However, in lossless dielectric systems, the diffraction limit has long been considered an unbreakable barrier to light confinement. Here, we uncover a novel class of wavefunctions - narwhal-shaped wavefunctions - and reveal their pivotal role in enabling extreme light confinement in lossless dielectrics across all spatial dimensions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental validation, we propose and realize a three-dimensional singular cavity supported by these wavefunctions, achieving an ultra-small mode volume of 5x10^-7 lambda^3 (lambda: free-space wavelength). Our findings open new frontiers for unprecedented control over light-matter interactions at the smallest possible scales.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds of focusing light through multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers, facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in multimode fibers, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Optimum design of permeable diffractive lenses based on photon sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon sieves are permeable diffractive optical elements generated by open apertures on a substrate. These elements are well suited for the monitoring of running fluids. Our analysis considers the fabrication constrains of the photon sieve and translate them into values of the optical parameters of the element. When used as focusing elements, or diffractive lenses, the spatial distribution of apertures can be designed to maximize the intensity at the focal plane and the permeability of the device. This is done by defining a weighted merit function. The computation time of this merit function is key when applying different strategies for the design, which often require a very large number of calculations of this merit function. Then, besides using a reliable propagation method, we have included an analytic solution applicable for circular apertures. Also, a geometrical merit function is proposed to simplify and reduce the computation even more. The methods proposed in this contribution are compared in terms of the focused irradiance and permeability parameters, allowing an educated choice adapted to the given case or application. In this contribution we analyze several methods to generate photon sieves in an optimum manner. The resulted spatial distributions resemble the classical Fresnel zone arrangement.</description>

      <title>Single-Pixel Imaging Technology in Holographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic microscopy method based on single-pixel imaging technology (HM-SPI). We used a holographic microscopy method based on in-line Gabor holography. In single-pixel imaging technology, cyclic binary masks and amplitude-phase masks are used instead of cyclic Hadamard masks. These masks are generated using the quadratic residue and twin-prime techniques. Numerical results are presented for both cases. Unlike the traditional approach of using DMD technology, our model considers a photodetector as a single-pixel detector. We propose a method based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to reconstruct the original field, which has a computational complexity of O(NlogN). This approach opens up prospects for the development of compact holographic systems capable of operating across a wide spectral range and under limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Versatile ultrafast single-shot imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast single-shot imaging techniques now reach frame rates of tens of tera-frame-per-second (Tfps) and long sequence depths but are often too complex for large-scale use, both in terms of image acquisition and reconstruction. We propose an extremely simple yet high-performance method that leverages the capabilities of two prominent technologies: acousto-optical pulse shaping and light-field based hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique by capturing laser-induced phenomena at frame rates on par with the state-of-the-art, and with the potential to reach the peta-frame-per-second, while keeping a versatile setup that is easily adaptable to various input pulse shapes and dynamic events. Furthermore, an extra degree of freedom is added to the system through the use of digital in-line holography on the single-shot motion pictures. The agility and performance of this technique could then open up new horizons for single-shot imaging techniques, making them accessible to a wider community.</description>

      <title>Topological laser in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with artificial gauge flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological lasers, known for their robustness and unique features originating from nontrivial topology, have recently become a focal point of research in photonics. In this work, we propose a topological laser based on two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial gauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial gauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge flux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger single-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge flux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders. We also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux govern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial theoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for advancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.</description>

      <title>Activating high-power parametric oscillation in photonic-crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By engineering the mode spectrum of a Kerr microresonator, we selectively activate nonlinear phase matching amongst broadband parametric gain. At threshold, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) emerge from vacuum fluctuations in the presence of a pump laser, and above threshold, OPOs seed the formation of intraresonator patterns and states, such as chaos and solitons. These competing nonlinear processes hinder an important application of OPOs as wavelength-variable, low-noise sources. Recently, nanopatterned microresonator OPOs have leveraged photonic crystal bandgaps to enable universal phase matching and control of nonlinear interactions. Here, we explore a design paradigm optimized for high-output power that uses geometric dispersion to suppress nonlinear interactions and a photonic crystal bandgap to activate only a single OPO interaction. Our devices convert an input pump laser to output signal and idler waves with powers exceeding 40 mW while maintaining spectral purity and side-mode suppression ratios greater than 40 dB. We show that this approach suits custom wavelengths by measuring four independent oscillators that vary only photonic crystal parameters to select output waves. Our experiments demonstrate that microresonators functionalized by photonic crystals offer a versatile and lossless palette of controls for nonlinear laser conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical and acoustic metasurfaces are two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength elements that locally modulate or phase shift incident waves. Acoustoplasmonic metasurfaces combine the physics of light and sound, producing acoustic wavefronts in response to optical stimuli. Herein, we present a computational inverse acoustoplasmonic metasurface design algorithm for desired optically-generated acoustic wave fields. We consider gold nanoparticles producing spherical acoustic waves in water, and the resulting acoustic wave propagation along the plane containing the nanoparticle array. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to design metasurfaces that can be used to achieve complex acoustic wave fields. This includes the design of a single metasurface that produces acoustic wave fields mimicking two different Morse code patterns upon stimulation with two orthogonal polarization states of light. This work provides a new tool for the design of complex optically generated acoustic wavefronts, enabling functionality beyond what would be achievable with off-optical-resonance optoacoustic excitation.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode free-space delay interferometer with no refractive compensation elements for phase encoded QKD protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate compensation-free approach to the realization of multi-mode delay interferometers, mainly for use in phase encoded quantum key distribution (QKD). High interference visibility of spatially multimode beams in unbalanced Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometers with a relatively wide range of delays is achieved by the appropriate choice of the transverse size of the beam. We provide a simple theoretical model that gives a direct connection between the visibility of interference, the delay, and the beam parameters. The performed experimental study confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the measured visibility of up to 0.95 for the delay of 2 ns. Our approach's simplicity and robust performance make it a practical choice for the implementation of QKD systems, where a quantum signal is received over a multimode fiber. The important application of such configuration is an intermodal QKD system, where the free-space atmospheric communication channel is coupled into a span of the multimode fiber, delivering the spatially distorted beam to the remote receiver with minimal coupling loss.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</description>

      <title>The Role of Buffer Gas in Shaping the D1 Line Spectrum of Potassium Vapour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of buffer gas and magnetic field on the spectral line shapes of the potassium D1 transition using sealed vapour cells filled with varying amounts of neon as a buffer gas. Employing a dual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and stem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum. Our results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to Lorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by collisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the first time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into the modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement between the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium D1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic fields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line shape. This work provides valuable insights into collision-induced broadening and shifts, enhancing our understanding of potassium spectroscopy and its application in the development of advanced magneto-optical filters for solar physics and other applications.</description>

      <title>Conservation law for angular momentum based on optical field derivatives: Analysis of optical spin-orbit conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing the loss of optical angular momentum (AM), including spin (SAM) and orbital (OAM) components, in light-matter interactions. Conventional SAM and OAM conservation laws rely on transverse field components, neglecting longitudinal fields and limiting applicability to vacuum. Our approach defines optical AM using time derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields, yielding a gauge-invariant formulation that includes both transverse and longitudinal components and explicitly incorporates charge and current densities. This enables a more complete description of AM dissipation in materials. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: scattering of circularly polarized (CP) beams by a gold nanoparticle and focusing of CP and linearly polarized optical vortex beams by a lens. The results show that SOC depends on particle size and polarization, with notable OAM loss in larger particles and CP beam focusing. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Dual Micro-Ring Resonators with Angular GST Modulation: Enabling Ultra-Fast Nonlinear Activation for Neuromorphic Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic technologies are emerging as powerful enablers for neuromorphic computing by delivering ultrafast and energy efficient neural functionalities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel all-optical dual micro ring resonator architecture incorporating the phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) to implement highly precise nonlinear activation functions (NLAFs). Our approach introduces angular positioning of GST segments within the rings, enabling fine-grained control over optical transmission dynamics. Through a systematic evaluation of sixteen distinct phase configurations, we identify an optimal GST placement 180 deg in the first ring and 90 deg in the second that achieves ultra narrowband transmission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of just 0.47 nm. This dual ring configuration provides two distinct resonant wavelengths, facilitating enhanced nonlinear modulation and multi level optical signal processing that closely mimics biological neuron behavior. Notably, the device achieves high contrast transmission, 0 to 0.85, across a 4 nm spectral window while operating at significantly reduced temperatures (100 deg C), outperforming traditional GST based designs.
  Furthermore, the dual-ring architecture enables independent optimization of spectral selectivity and switching contrast capabilities previously unattainable with single ring structures. These results establish a promising pathway toward scalable, high speed neuromorphic photonic systems, offering both the precision and switching speed required for practical on chip neural processing.</description>

      <title>$M^2$ as a Quantitative Measure for Beam Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam quality is a fundamental aspect for evaluating the performance of laser sources. $M^2$-measurements serve as the gold standard for beam quality assessment since the 1990s. The measured $M^2$-parameter indicates similarity to the pure fundamental Gaussian mode, characterized by the ideal $M^2=1$, by describing a beams' divergence. $M^2$-values close to 1 are considered to correspond to nearly fundamental sources. However, in terms of the higher-order mode contribution of a laser, it acts as a qualitative measure that does not permit a quantitative statement. Here, we introduce a framework to assess the fundamental mode content of a laser beam using $M^2$-measurements and establish a direct link between beam quality and its mode composition. Our results significantly enhance the utility of $M^2$-measurements in evaluating laser sources, coupling efficiencies, focusing performance, and long-distance propagation. This repositions $M^2$ from a qualitative figure to a quantitative tool in modern photonics.</description>

      <title>Microring resonator as a Rayleigh mirror for broadband laser cavity comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality microring resonators (MRRs) have proven to be promising sources of optical combs generated from continuous-wave radiation. In addition to the primary comb that propagates along with the pump, Rayleigh scattering creates a comb that travels in the opposite direction. Normally, the scattering is a very weak, however, in the high-quality-factor MRR the power transferred to the backward-propagating comb can be quite significant. We demonstrate that the backward-propagating comb can be used as a feedback source for a fiber laser, effectively creating a nonlinear mirror for the laser cavity. By assembling a simple laser cavity comprising only active fiber and two mirrors, one of which is an integrated MRR, we show a robust self-starting comb generation with width exceeding 500 nm. We confirm the universal character of this approach for other types of microresonators, including whispering gallery mode resonators, by launching self-starting laser cavity combs with the crystalline toroidal cavity, coupled with a tapered fiber. This method provides significant simplification for the filter-driven laser cavity soliton generation, especially when free-space coupling is applied.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum: setting the record straight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Waves Determined by the Tangential Electric Field of Incident Plane Wave at a Charged and Lossy Planar Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the tangential and normal decomposition of wave vectors and electric fields with respect to a charged planar interface between two isotropic lossy media, all of the incident, reflected, and refracted plane waves are found to be only determined by the tangential electric field of the incident plane wave. The complex wave vectors and their corresponding complex angles of the incident, reflected and refracted waves are easily calculated from the tangential wave vector based on the phase matching condition and the complex Snell's law. The electric field magnitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted waves were deduced from the tangential electric field magnitude and the tangential wave vector of the incident wave where the tangential boundary condition of electric fields can be directly utilized. The time-averaged Poynting vectors and the surface Joule heat density at the interface are also given to demonstrate the validity of the methodology by the energy balance condition together with a specific example. It is also found that the external surface charges with a practical surface charge density have little effect on the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves. This work opens a new route faster than the conventional way for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves at a charged and lossy planar interface without the need to perform the polarization decomposition of the incident plane wave and without the usage of the Fresnel refraction coefficients.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson Phase Transitions in Y-shaped Plasmonic Valley Metal-slabs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throughout history, all developmental trajectories of civilization - encompassing progress, creation, and innovation - have fundamentally pursued the paradigm shift 'from disorder to order'. In photonics, investigations into disordered systems have primarily focused on foundational principles governing signal diffusion and localization. This paper addresses terahertz device development by examining the dual role of disorder in photonic systems: while potentially compromising optical transmission stability, it simultaneously inspires innovative topological protection mechanisms. Building upon the symmetry-breaking induced valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transition in Y-shaped metallic structures, we achieve valley Chern number modulation through random rotation of constituent units, demonstrating progressive emergence of in-gap topological states with increasing disorder parameters and observing topological negative refraction phenomena. Furthermore, an effective Dirac two-band model is established to quantitatively characterize the evolution of bulk transport states under disorder variation. By strategically regulating disordered configurations to induce valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transitions, this research provides new pathways for overcoming critical technical challenges in terahertz devices, particularly transmission loss limitations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transfer during quantum frequency conversion in gas-filled hollow-core fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction is essential for the future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient and tunable frequency conversion of arbitrary light fields down to the single-photon limit. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. In this Letter, we employ a quantum Hamiltonian framework to characterize the behavior of entanglement during molecular modulation, while describing the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments. In particular, apart from obtaining analytical expressions for the final opto-molecular states, our model predicts a close correlation between the evolution of the average photon numbers and the transfer of entanglement between the interacting parties. These results will contribute to the development of new fiber-based strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the upcoming generation of lightwave quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>
