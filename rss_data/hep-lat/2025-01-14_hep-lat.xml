      <title>Direct Monte Carlo computation of the 't~Hooft partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 't~Hooft partition function~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$ of an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry is defined as the Fourier transform of the partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ with respect to temporal components of the 't~Hooft flux~$B$. Its large volume behavior detects the quantum phase of the system. When the integrand of the functional integral is real-positive, the latter partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ can be numerically computed by a Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, just by counting the number of configurations of a specific 't~Hooft flux~$B$. We carry out this program for the $SU(2)$ pure Yang--Mills theory with the vanishing $\theta$-angle by employing a newly-developed hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm (the halfway HMC) for the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory. The numerical result clearly shows that all non-electric fluxes are ``light'' as expected in the ordinary confining phase with the monopole condensate. Invoking the Witten effect on~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$, this also indicates the oblique confinement at~$\theta=2\pi$ with the dyon condensate.</description>

      <title>Gluon nonlocal operator mixing in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the renormalization of a comprehensive set of gauge-invariant gluon nonlocal operators on the lattice. We calculate the renormalization factors for these operators in the modified Minimal Subtraction $(\rm \overline{MS})$ scheme up to one-loop, using both dimensional and lattice regularizations in the Wilson gluon action. To facilitate a non-perturbative renormalization approach, we examine an appropriate version of the modified regularization-invariant (${\rm RI}'$) scheme and determine the conversion factors from this scheme to $\rm \overline{MS}$. As an integral part of this procedure, by employing symmetry arguments on the lattice, we identify the mixing pattern of these operators under renormalization.</description>

      <title>The strength of the interaction between quarks and gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern particle physics experiments, e.g. at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, crucially depend on the precise description of the scattering processes in terms of the known fundamental forces. This is limited by our current understanding of the strong nuclear force, as quantified by the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, between quarks and gluons. Relating $\alpha_s$ to experiments poses a major challenge as the strong interactions lead to the confinement of quarks and gluons inside hadronic bound states. At high energies, however, the strong interactions become weaker ("asymptotic freedom") and thus amenable to an expansion in powers of the coupling. Attempts to relate both regimes usually rely on modeling of the bound state problem in one way or another. Using large scale numerical simulations of a first principles formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics on a space-time lattice, we have carried out a model-independent determination of $\alpha_s$ with unprecedented precision. The uncertainty, about half that of all other results combined, originates predominantly from the statistical Monte Carlo evaluation and has a clear probabilistic interpretation. The result for $\alpha_s$ describes a variety of physical phenomena over a wide range of energy scales. If used as input information, it will enable significantly improved analyses of many high energy experiments, by removing an important source of theoretical uncertainty. This will increase the likelihood to uncover small effects of yet unknown physics, and enable stringent precision tests of the Standard Model. In summary, this result boosts the discovery potential of the LHC and future colliders, and the methods developed in this work pave the way for even higher precision in the future.</description>

      <title>Two-loop gradient-flow renormalization of scalar QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formalism is applied to a non-Abelian gauge theory with scalar and fermionic particles, dubbed "scalar QCD". It is shown that the flowed scalar quark requires a field renormalization, albeit only beyond the one-loop level. A pseudo-physical, t-dependent renormalization scheme is defined, and the corresponding renormalization constant is evaluated at the two-loop level. We also calculate the gluon action density as well as the condensate of the scalar and the fermionic quark at three-loop level in this theory. The results validate the consistency of the gradient-flow formalism in this theory and provide a further step towards applying the gradient-flow formalism to the full Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Hubbard Model with Equivariant Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly normalizing flows, have shown exceptional performance in learning probability distributions across various domains of physics, including statistical mechanics, collider physics, and lattice field theory. In the context of lattice field theory, normalizing flows have been successfully applied to accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution, enabling a range of tasks such as direct estimation of thermodynamic observables and sampling independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) configurations.
  In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration that normalizing flows can be used to learn the Boltzmann distribution for the Hubbard model. This model is widely employed to study the electronic structure of graphene and other carbon nanomaterials. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the Hubbard model, such as those based on Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, often suffer from ergodicity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates of physical observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that leveraging i.i.d.\ sampling from the normalizing flow effectively addresses these issues.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ from its light-quark mass dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>
