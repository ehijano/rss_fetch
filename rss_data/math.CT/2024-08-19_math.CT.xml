      <title>Unitary magma actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of action for unitary magmas, facilitating the classification of various split extensions within this algebraic structure. Our method expands upon the recent study of split extensions and semidirect products of unitary magmas conducted by Gran, Janelidze, and Sobral. Building on their research, we explore split extensions in which the middle object does not necessarily maintain a bijective correspondence with the Cartesian product of its end objects. Although this phenomenon is not observed in groups or any associative semiabelian variety of universal algebra, it shares similarities with instances found in monoids through weakly Schreier extensions and certain exotic non-associative algebras, such as semi-left-loops. Our work seeks to contribute to the comprehension of split extensions in unitary magmas and may offer valuable insights for potential abstractions of categorical properties in more general contexts.</description>

      <title>Sober $L$-convex spaces and $L$-join-semilattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a complete residuated lattice $L$ as the truth value table, we extend the definition of sobriety of classical convex spaces to the framework of $L$-convex spaces. We provide a specific construction for the sobrification of an $L$-convex space, demonstrating that the full subcategory of sober $L$-convex spaces is reflective in the category of $L$-convex spaces with convexity-preserving mappings. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Scott $L$-convex structures on $L$-ordered sets. As an application of this type of sobriety, we obtain a characterization for the $L$-join-semilattice completion of an $L$-ordered set: an $L$-ordered set $Q$ is an $L$-join-semilattice completion of an $L$-ordered set $P$ if and only if the Scott $L$-convex space $(Q, \sigma^{\ast}(Q))$ is a sobrification of the Scott $L$-convex space $(P, \sigma^{\ast}(P))$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Kan extensions along 2-fibrations and the 2-category of elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 2-category of elements from an abstract point of view. We generalize to dimension 2 the well-known result that the category of elements can be captured by a comma object that also exhibits a pointwise left Kan extension. For this, we propose an original definition of pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration in the lax 3-category of 2-categories, 2-functors, lax natural transformations and modifications. Such definition uses cartesian-marked lax limits, which are an alternative to weighted 2-limits. We show that a pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration is always a weak one as well. The proof is based on an original generalization of the parametrized Yoneda lemma which is as lax as it can be.</description>

      <title>Remarks on cotorsion theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present some results from classical homological algebra using the language of cotorsion theories in abelian categories. The results are a couple of foundational facts about homological dimension, the Kunneth formula and the universal coefficients formula. We also present some ''totally acyclic'' cotorsion theories and revisit some results from the literature concerning resolutions of chain complexes in abelian categories.</description>

      <title>Indexed Grothendieck construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce an indexed version of the Grothendieck construction. This gives an equivalence of categories between opfibrations over a fixed base in the 2-category of 2-copresheaves and 2-copresheaves on the Grothendieck construction of the fixed base. We also prove that this equivalence is pseudonatural in the base and that it restricts to discrete opfibrations with small fibres and copresheaves. Our result is a 2-dimensional generalization of the equivalence between slices of copresheaves and copresheaves on slices. We can think of the indexed Grothendieck construction as a simultaneous Grothendieck construction on every index that takes into account all bonds between different indexes.</description>

      <title>Commutativity and liftings of codensity monads of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another universal property of probability monads as liftings of the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad and provide a novel characterisation of the Radon monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to \textbf{MonCat}, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Typed Extensional and Intensional Models in Formal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensional computation derives concrete outputs from abstract function definitions; extensional computation defines functions through explicit input-output pairs. In formal semantics: intensional computation interprets expressions as context-dependent functions; extensional computation evaluates expressions based on their denotations in an otherwise fixed context. This paper reformulates typed extensional and intensional models of formal semantics within a category-theoretic framework and demonstrates their natural representation therein. We construct $\textbf{ModInt}$, the category of intensional models, building on the categories $\textbf{Set}$ of sets, $\textbf{Rel}$ of relations, and $\textbf{Kr}$ and $\textbf{Kr}_\textbf{b}$ of Kripke frames with monotone maps and bounded morphisms, respectively. We prove that trivial intensional models are equivalent to extensional models, providing a unified categorical representation of intensionality and extensionality in formal semantics. This approach reinterprets the relationship between intensions and extensions in a categorical framework and offers a modular, order-independent method for processing intensions and recovering extensions; contextualizing the relationship between content and reference in category-theoretic terms. We discuss implications for natural language semantics and propose future directions for contextual integration and exploring $\textbf{ModInt}$'s algebraic properties.</description>
