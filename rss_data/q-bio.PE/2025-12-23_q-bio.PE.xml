      <title>Adapting cluster graphs for inference of continuous trait evolution on phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming approaches have long been applied to fit models of univariate and multivariate trait evolution on phylogenetic trees for discrete and continuous traits, and more recently adapted to phylogenetic networks with reticulation. We previously showed that various trait evolution models on a network can be readily cast as probabilistic graphical models, so that likelihood-based estimation can proceed efficiently via belief propagation on an associated clique tree. Even so, exact likelihood inference can grow computationally prohibitive for large complex networks. Loopy belief propagation can similarly be applied to these settings, using non-tree cluster graphs to optimize a factored energy approximation to the log-likelihood, and may provide a more practical trade-off between estimation accuracy and runtime. However, the influence of cluster graph structure on this trade-off is not precisely understood. We conduct a simulation study using the Julia package PhyloGaussianBeliefProp to investigate how varying maximum cluster size affects this trade-off for Gaussian trait evolution models on networks. We discuss recommended choices for maximum cluster size, and prove the equivalence of likelihood-based and factored-energy-based parameter estimates for the homogeneous Brownian motion model.</description>

      <title>Phage-antibiotic therapy under density dependent bacterial defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phage therapy is an alternative treatment method for bacterial infections. It has shown particular promise in reducing bacterial load while preventing antibiotic resistance. Here, we develop a mathematical model of a bacterial infection within a host to study phage therapy. It incorporates interactions between phages, bacteria, the immune system, and antibiotics. Additionally, the model includes bacterial social dynamics that provide protection from treatments and the innate immune response. We analytically and numerically identify all of the equilibria of the model and derive insights regarding the overall effectiveness of phage therapy. Without phage therapy, the model exhibits bistability: bacteria populations above a threshold grow and become entrenched, while those below it can be effectively suppressed by the immune system. We find that that phages destabilize the former equilibrium, and thus in combination with the immune system are able to suppress the bacteria. We conducted bifurcation analyses, which show that the equilibrium with a suppressed population of bacteria can become unstable. In this scenario, the system undergoes oscillations. However, these oscillations -- which can be exacerbated by social dynamics -- lead to minuscule bacterial populations, and thus, in practice, phage therapy is widely effective across the parameter space. We also demonstrate how suppression can be further improved by the addition of periodic dosing of antibiotics in a combination therapy.</description>

      <title>From Brain Scans to Therapy Response: PDE Modelling of Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumour with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. This study presents a mathematical framework to investigate the efficacy of immunotherapy strategies based on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) infusion. The model couples tumour and immune dynamics through a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), incorporating cell proliferation, diffusion, and chemotactic migration in response to TGF-$\beta$, a tumour-secreted signalling molecule. A reduced ordinary differential equation (ODE) model is first analysed to derive threshold conditions for tumour eradication, identifying critical infusion levels consistent with clinical data. Numerical bifurcation analysis explores the impact of parameter variations. The full PDE model is solved using the finite element method on simplified 2D domains, followed by sensitivity analyses to quantify parameter influence on tumour mass and volume. The model is then applied to a realistic 3D brain geometry reconstructed from patient-specific MRI and DTI data, accounting for anatomical anisotropy and tissue heterogeneity. Therapeutic scenarios are simulated with spatially localised lymphocyte infusion. Results highlight spatial variations in tumour growth and treatment response, with infusion intensity and tumour location critically influencing therapeutic outcomes. These findings emphasise the importance of personalised, spatially informed modelling in optimising immunotherapy protocols for GBM.</description>

      <title>Enabling Evolutionary Therapy in Metastatic Cancer Lacking Serum Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary therapy (ET) aims to steer tumor evolution by adjusting treatment timing and dosing to control rather than eradicate tumor burden. Clinical use requires reliable monitoring of tumor dynamics to inform mathematical models that guide therapy. In cancers such as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, ET models are informed by serial serum biomarkers. For cancers lacking reliable biomarkers, such as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiographic imaging remains the primary method for treatment response assessment, typically using RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST, which tracks a few lesions with one-dimensional (1D) measurements and defines progression relative to the nadir, the smallest tumor burden recorded after treatment, was not designed to support ET. It may miss early regrowth, underrepresent tumor burden, and obscure disease trends. Using a virtual NSCLC patient model, we demonstrate that lesion selection and measurement dimensionality strongly affect progression detection. Two-dimensional metrics provide modest improvement, but only 3D volumetric measurements accurately capture both tumor burden and its dynamics, which are key requirements for ET. To support ET in cancers lacking biomarkers, response assessment must evolve beyond RECIST by integrating volumetric imaging, automated segmentation, and potentially liquid biopsies, alongside redefining progression criteria to enable adaptive, patient-centered treatments.</description>

      <title>Impact of temporary lockdown on disease extinction in assortative networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing environmental conditions can significantly affect the dynamics of disease spread. These changes may arise naturally or result from human interventions; in the latter case, lockdown measures that lead to abrupt but temporary reductions in transmission rates are used to combat disease spread. However, the impact of these measures on rare events in realistic populations has not been studied so far. Here, we analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model in a stochastic setting where disease extinction -- a sudden clearance of the infection -- occurs via a rare, large fluctuation. We use a semiclassical approximation and extensive numerical simulations to show how the extinction risk of the disease depends on both the duration and magnitude of the lockdown, in heterogeneous assortative networks, with degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Emergence of Selection Prior to Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selection is central to biological evolution, yet there has been no general experimental framework for quantifying selection in chemical systems before life. Here we demonstrate that selection in a prebiological chemical system can be directly quantified. Assembly Theory predicts that selection corresponds to a transition from undirected to directed exploration of chemical possibility space, measurable through the amount of Assembly, A, which integrates molecular assembly index with observed copy number. By analysing peptide ensembles produced under diverse polymerisation conditions, we show that undirected reactions explore sequence space almost uniformly, yielding exploration ratios of 0.85-0.95, whereas reactions influenced by evolved proteases generate markedly lower ratios (0.51-0.75) and elevated A, consistent with selective reinforcement of specific assembly pathways. Across multiple environments and amino-acid combinations, the exploration ratio and ensemble assembly A robustly distinguish directed from undirected exploration, establishing a general, experimentally tractable metric for detecting and measuring selection in chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Neutral theory of cooperative dynamics</title>

Abstract: Mutualistic interactions are widespread in nature, from plant communities and microbiomes to human organizations. Along with competition for resources, cooperative interactions shape biodiversity and contribute to the robustness of complex ecosystems. We present a stochastic neutral theory of cooperator species. Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable likelihood of being: origin of life, terraforming, and AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life on Earth via the spontaneous emergence of a protocell prior to Darwinian evolution remains a fundamental open question in physics and chemistry. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on information theory and algorithmic complexity. Using estimates grounded in modern computational models, we evaluate the difficulty of assembling structured biological information under plausible prebiotic conditions. Our results highlight the formidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell within the available window of Earth's early history. While the idea of Earth being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor from within mainstream science, directed panspermia -- originally proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel -- remains a speculative but logically open alternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous emergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Hysteresis: Cycling about in a Rugged Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and empirical analysis to identify and characterize evolutionary hysteresis. We first show how epistatic interactions create bistable fitness landscapes and structural hysteresis in a two-locus Wright-Fisher model, revealing two distinct hysteresis regimes under cyclic and noisy selection. Notably, an epistatically constrained population achieves maximal average fitness at an intermediate level of environmental stochasticity. We then extend this framework to more complex systems, demonstrating robust hysteresis loops in both a disordered multi-locus model and in biophysically realistic simulation of protein structural flexibility. Finally, we present direct empirical evidence of evolutionary hysteresis. By analyzing two decades of metagenomic time-series data from freshwater C. Nanopelagicaceae experiencing strong seasonal temperature cycles, we find that approximately 65% of seasonally oscillating alleles exhibit statistically significant hysteresis. Together, these results establish hysteresis as a general, measurable feature of evolution and a potential probe of complex fitness landscapes.</description>

      <title>Estimating excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract:   Background. The excess mortality rate in Aotearoa New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic is frequently estimated to be among the lowest in the world. However, to facilitate international comparisons, many of the methods that have been used to estimate excess mortality do not use age-stratified data on deaths and population size, which may compromise their accuracy.
  Methods. We used a quasi-Poisson regression model for monthly all-cause deaths among New Zealand residents, controlling for age, sex and seasonality. We fitted the model to deaths data for 2014-19. We estimated monthly excess mortality for 2020-23 as the difference between actual deaths and projected deaths according to the model. We conducted sensitivity analysis on the length of the pre-pandemic period used to fit the model. We benchmarked our results against a simple linear regression on the standardised annual mortality rate.
  Results. We estimated cumulative excess mortality in New Zealand in 2020-23 was 1040 (95% confidence interval [-1134, 2927]), equivalent to 0.7% [-0.8%, 2.0%] of expected mortality. Excess mortality was negative in 2020-21. The magnitude, timing and age-distribution of the positive excess mortality in 2022-23 were closely matched with confirmed Covid-19 deaths.
  Conclusions. Negative excess mortality in 2020-21 reflects very low levels of Covid-19 and major reductions in seasonal respiratory diseases during this period. In 2022-23, Covid-19 deaths were the main contributor to excess mortality and there was little or no net non-Covid-19 excess. Overall, New Zealand experienced one of the lowest rates of pandemic excess mortality in the world.</description>
