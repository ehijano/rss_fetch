      <title>On the Symmetric Tensors Completion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this elaborate is presenting the classical symmetric tensors completion problem to an audience of graduate students. As main studying tool, we will introduce the theory of hypergraph rigidity which naturally mirrors the problem itself. This has already appeared in literature: in 2023, Cruicksand, Mohammadi, Nixon, and Tanigawa introduced organically the theory of hypergraph rigidity, as a generalization of the usual Euclidean rigidity, and showed how it can be used to mirror several different theoretical problems, including tensor completion.</description>

      <title>Notes on Nash modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nash blowing-up (or modification) of an algebraic variety $X$ is a canonical process that produces a proper, birational morphism $\pi : X' \to X$ of varieties. It is expected that the singularities of $X'$ will be better than those of $X$. In the mid-1970's, it was proved that in characteristic zero, ${\pi}$ is an isomorphism if and only if $X$ is nonsingular, which is false in positive characteristic. The focus of this article is on several subsequent studies on this subject.
  Topics covered include: (a) the extension of the mentioned theorem to the case where $X$ is normal, in any characteristic, (b) the introduction and study of Nash modifications of higher order, (c) the case where the variety $X$ is toric, where more precise results can be obtained and (d) desingularization properties of the Nash process.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions on crepant resolutions of quotients of product varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct stability conditions on crepant resolutions of quotients of certain product varieties, giving as a special case the first examples of stability conditions on strict Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrary dimension. Along the way, we prove the crepant resolutions are derived equivalent to the corresponding quotient stacks, verifying an instance of a conjecture of Bondal and Orlov.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic multicanonical systems of smooth affine surfaces of logarithmic Kodaira dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth affine surface of logarithmic Kodaira dimension one and let $(V,D)$ be a pair of a smooth projective surface $V$ and a simple normal crossing divisor $D$ on $V$ such that $V \setminus \operatorname{Supp} D = S$. In this paper, we consider the logarithmic multicanonical system $|m(K_V + D)|$. We prove that, for any $m \geq 8$, $|m(K_V+D)|$ gives an $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration form $V$ onto a smooth projective curve.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Currents on Cohesive Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on a complex variety $X$ that has a locally free resolution $E^{\bullet}$. In [19], the authors constructed a pseudomeromorphic current whose support is contained in $supp(E^{\bullet})$ that represents products of Chern classes of $\mathcal{F}.$ In this paper, we show that their construction works for general de-Rham characteristic classes and then generalize it to represent products (in de-Rham cohomology) of characteristic forms of cohesive modules defined by Block. Finally, we state a corollary to a transgression result in [16] that show that it is sufficient to only use the degree-$0$ and degree-$1$ parts of the superconnection to construct currents that represent characteristic forms of cohesive modules in the Bott-Chern cohomology.</description>

      <title>Stokes phenomenon of Kloosterman and Airy connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define categories of Stokes filtered and Stokes graded $G$-local systems for reductive groups $G$ and use the formalism of Tannakian categories to show that they are equivalent to the category of $G$-connections. We then use the interpretation of moduli spaces of Stokes filtered $G$-local systems as braid varieties to prove physical rigidity of two well-known families of cohomologically rigid connections, the Kloosterman and Airy connections. In the Kloosterman case, our proof relies on Steinberg's cross-section.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that a non-singular real plane projective curve of degree five with five connected components is separating if and only if its ovals are in non-convex position. In this article, this property is set into a different context and generalised to all real plane separating (M-2)-curves.</description>

      <title>Orbits of Theta Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theta characteristics on a Riemann surface are permuted by the induced action of the automorphism group, with the orbit structure being important for the geometry of the curve and associated manifolds. We describe two new methods for advancing the understanding of these orbits, generalising existing results of Kallel &amp; Sjerve, allowing us to establish the existence of infinitely many curves possessing a unique invariant characteristic as well as determine the number of invariant characteristics for all Hurwitz curves with simple automorphism group. In addition, we compute orbit decompositions for a substantial number of curves with genus $\leq 9$, allowing the identification of where current theoretical understanding falls short and the potential applications of machine learning techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish dimension formulas for the Witt vector affine Springer fibers associated to a reductive group over a mixed characteristic local field, under the assumption that the group is essentially tamely ramified and the residue characteristic is not bad. Besides the discriminant valuations that show up in classical works on the usual affine Springer fibers, our formula also involves the Artin conductors and the Kottwitz invariants of the relevant conjugacy classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the following three families of geometric objects: Schubert varieties in flag manifolds, matrix Schubert varieties, and Borel orbits of 2-nilpotent matrices. The first family is governed by permutations, the second by partial permutations, and the last one by "link patterns". These geometric objects admit characteristic classes in equivariant elliptic cohomology obtained within the framework created by Borisov and Libgober. We construct a Hecke-type algebra for computing elliptic classes and extend its action to include partial permutations and linking patterns. A uniform point of view facilitates a better understanding of duality.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of three dimensional automorphic Galois representations over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho_\ell$ be a semisimple $\ell$-adic representation of a number field $K$ that is unramified almost everywhere. We introduce a new notion called weak abelian direct summands of $\rho_\ell$ and completely characterize them, for example, if the algebraic monodromy of $\rho_\ell$ is connected. If $\rho_\ell$ is in addition $E$-rational for some number field $E$, we prove that the weak abelian direct summands are locally algebraic (and thus de Rham). We also show that the weak abelian parts of a connected semisimple Serre compatible system form again such a system.
  Using our results on weak abelian direct summands, when $K$ is totally real and $\rho_\ell$ is the three-dimensional $\ell$-adic representation attached to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic, not necessarily polarizable representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_K)$ together with an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}\simeq \overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$, we prove that $\rho_\ell$ is irreducible. We deduce in this case also some $\ell$-adic Hodge theoretic properties of $\rho_\ell$ if $\ell$ belongs to a Dirichlet density one set of primes.</description>

      <title>Some algebras with trivial rings of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field. We construct examples of regular local $k$-algebras $R$ (of positive dimension) for which the ring of differential operators $D_k(R)$ is trivial in the sense that it contains {\it no} operators of positive order. The examples are excellent in characteristic zero but not in positive characteristic. These rings can be viewed as being non-singular but they are not simple as $D$-modules, laying to rest speculation that $D$-simplicity might characterize a nice class of singularities in general. In prime characteristic, the construction also provides examples of {\it regular} local rings $R$ (with fraction field a function field) whose Frobenius push-forward $F_*^eR$ is {\it indecomposable} as an $R$-module for all $e\in \mathbb N$. Along the way, we investigate hypotheses on a local ring $(R, m)$ under which $D$-simplicity for $R$ is equivalent to $D$-simplicity for its $m$-adic completion, and give examples of rings for which the differential operators do not behave well under completion. We also generalize a characterization of $D$-simplicity due to Jeffries in the $\mathbb N$-graded case: for a Noetherian local $k$-algebra $(R, m, k)$, $D$-simplicity of $R$ is equivalent to surjectivity of the natural map $D_k(R)\to D_k(R, k)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce morphisms for matroids with coefficients (in the sense of Baker and Bowler) and quiver matroids. We investigate their basic properties, such as functoriality, duality, minors and cryptomorphic characterizations in terms of vectors, circuits and bases (a.k.a. Grassmann-Pl\"ucker functions). We generalize quiver matroids to quiver matroid bundles and construct their moduli space, which is an $\mathbb{F}_1$-analogue of a complex quiver Grassmannian. Eventually we introduce a suitable interpretation of $\mathbb{F}_1$-points for these moduli spaces, so that in 'nice' cases their number is equal to the Euler characteristic of the associated complex quiver Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the local relative geometric Langlands conjecture of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{PGL}_2^\mathrm{diag}$ of the triple product $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{\times 3}$ (and also for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{G}_2$ of $\mathrm{SO}_8/\mu_2$), whose corresponding Langlands dual $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-variety can be identified with the symplectic vector space $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3} \cong \mathbf{A}^8$ of $2\times 2 \times 2$-cubes. Our analysis relies on a construction of Bhargava relating $2 \times 2 \times 2$-cubes to Gauss composition on quadratic forms, arising here as the moment map for the Hamiltonian $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-action on $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3}$, and the Cayley hyperdeterminant as studied by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the bigraded quasi-isomorphism type of the bigraded, bidifferential algebra of forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold generally contains more information than the de Rham cohomology algebra with its real Hodge structure. More precisely, on any closed Riemann surface of genus at least two, there is a nontrivial ABC-Massey product. Furthermore, starting from dimension three, there are simply connected projective manifolds with a nonzero ABC-Massey product of three divisor classes. In particular, compact K\"ahler manifolds are generally not formal in the sense of pluripotential homotopy theory.</description>

Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the Grunwald problem for new families of non-solvable finite groups G, away from the set of primes dividing |G|. Furthermore, we show that such G verify the condition (BM), that is, the Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation is the only one for quotients of SL_n by G. These new families include extensions of groups satisfying (BM) by kernels which are products of symmetric groups S_m, with $m\neq 2,6$, and alternating groups A_5. We also investigate (BM) for small groups by giving an explicit list of small order groups for which (BM) is unknown and we show that for many of them (BM) holds under Schinzel's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.12491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of the tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic for $GL_n(k)$. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt; n$. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$ with marked points, and fix a parabolic subgroup of $GL_n(k)$ at each marked point. We denote by $\text{Bun}_{n,P}$ the moduli stack of (quasi-)parabolic vector bundles on $X$, and by $\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}$ the moduli stack of parabolic flat connections such that the residue is nilpotent with respect to the parabolic reduction at each marked point. We construct an equivalence between the bounded derived category $D^{b}(\text{Qcoh}({\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}^{0}}))$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on an open substack $\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}^{0}\subset\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}$, and the bounded derived category $D^{b}(\mathcal{D}^{0}_{{\text{Bun}}_{n,P}}\text{-mod})$ of $\mathcal{D}^{0}_{{\text{Bun}}_{n,P}}$-modules, where $\mathcal{D}^0_{\text{Bun}_{n,P}}$ is a localization of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{Bun}_{n,P}}$ the sheaf of crystalline differential operators on $\text{Bun}_{n,P}$. Thus we extend the work of Bezrukavnikov-Braverman to the tamely ramified case. We also prove a correspondence between flat connections on $X$ with regular singularities and meromorphic Higgs bundles on the Frobenius twist $X^{(1)}$ of $X$ with first order poles .</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety. We construct partial Okounkov bodies associated to Hermitian pseudo-effective line bundles $(L,\phi)$ on $X$. We show that partial Okounkov bodies are universal invariants of the singularity of $\phi$. As an application, we generalize the theorem of Boucksom--Chen and construct Duistermaat--Heckman measures associated with finite energy metrics on the Berkovich analytification of an ample line bundle.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of moduli spaces of principal bundles over a smooth curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any almost-simple group $G$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, we describe the automorphism group of the moduli space of semistable $G$-bundles over a connected smooth projective curve $C$ of genus at least $4$. The result is achieved by studying the singular fibers of the Hitchin fibration. As a byproduct, we provide a description of the irreducible components of two natural closed subsets in the Hitchin basis: the divisor of singular cameral curves and the divisor of singular Hitchin fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R=C[[t]]$ be the ring of power series over an algebraically closed field $C$ of characteristic zero. We show that each connection on a finite flat $R((x))$-module is the sum of a regular singular connection and a diagonalizable $R((x))$-linear endomorphism when it admits a Turrittin-Levelt-Jordan form over $R((x))$. This decomposition is compatible with the limit of the logarithmic decompositions of the connections obtained by the reduction modulo $t^{k}$ of a given connection.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz integrality of the power series expansion of the sigma function for a telescopic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A telescopic curve is a certain algebraic curve defined by $m-1$ equations in the affine space of dimension $m$, which can be a hyperelliptic curve and an $(n,s)$ curve as a special case. The sigma function $\sigma(u)$ associated with the telescopic curve of genus $g$ is a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}^g$. For a subring $R$ of $\mathbb{C}$ and variables $u={}^t(u_1,\dots, u_g)$, let \[R\langle\langle u \rangle\rangle=\left\{\sum_{i_1,\dots,i_g\ge0}\kappa_{i_1,\dots,i_g}\frac{u_1^{i_1}\cdots u_g^{i_g}}{i_1!\cdots i_g!}\;\middle|\;\kappa_{i_1,\dots,i_g}\in R\right\}.\] If the power series expansion of a holomorphic function $f(u)$ on $\mathbb{C}^g$ around the origin belongs to $R\langle\langle u \rangle\rangle$, then $f(u)$ is said to be Hurwitz integral over $R$. In this paper, we show that the sigma function $\sigma(u)$ associated with the telescopic curve is Hurwitz integral over the ring generated by the coefficients of the defining equations of the curve and $\frac{1}{2}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. Further, we show that $\sigma(u)^2$ is Hurwitz integral over the ring generated by the coefficients of the defining equations of the curve over $\mathbb{Z}$. Our results are a generalization of the results of Y. \^Onishi for $(n,s)$ curves to telescopic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the rational class and Picard groups of the moduli space of stable logarithmic maps in genus zero, with target projective space relative a hyperplane. For the class group we exhibit an explicit basis consisting of boundary divisors. For the Picard group we exhibit a spanning set indexed by piecewise-linear functions on the tropicalisation. In both cases a complete set of boundary relations is obtained by pulling back the WDVV relations from the space of stable curves. Our proofs hinge on a controlled technique for manufacturing test curves in logarithmic mapping spaces, opening up the topology of these spaces to further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An action of a complex reductive group $\mathrm G$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ is regular when all regular unipotent elements in $\mathrm G$ act with finitely many fixed points. Then the complex $\mathrm G$-equivariant cohomology ring of $X$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of a certain regular fixed point scheme. Examples include partial flag varieties, smooth Schubert varieties and Bott-Samelson varieties. We also show that a more general version of the fixed point scheme allows a generalisation to GKM spaces, such as toric varieties.</description>

Abstract: Given an NQC log canonical generalized pair $(X,B+M)$ whose underlying variety $X$ is not necessarily $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial, we show that one may run a $(K_X+B+M)$-MMP with scaling of an ample divisor which terminates, provided that $(X,B+M)$ has a minimal model in a weaker sense or that $K_X+B+M$ is not pseudo-effective. We also prove the existence of minimal models of pseudo-effective NQC log canonical generalized pairs under various additional assumptions, for instance, when the boundary contains an ample divisor.</description>

Abstract: Applying the technique of $p$-adic integration, we prove the topological mirror symmetry conjecture of Hausel-Thaddeus for the moduli spaces of (strongly) parabolic Higgs bundles for the structure groups $\text{SL}_n$ and $\text{PGL}_n$, building on previous work of Groechenig-Wyss-Ziegler on the non-parabolic case. We also prove the $E$-polynomial of the smooth moduli space of parabolic $\text{GL}_n$-Higgs bundles is independent of the degree of the underlying vector bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11921v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a projective variety with an int-amplified endomorphism of degree invertible in the base field satisfies Bott vanishing. This is a new way to analyze which varieties have nontrivial endomorphisms. In particular, we extend some classification results on varieties admitting endomorphisms (for Fano threefolds of Picard number one and several other cases) to any characteristic. The classification results in characteristic zero are due to Amerik-Rovinsky-Van de Ven, Hwang-Mok, Paranjape-Srinivas, Beauville, and Shao-Zhong. Our method also bounds the degree of morphisms into a given variety. Finally, we relate endomorphisms to global $F$-regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y(E_n)$ denote the moduli space of pairs $(S,B)$ where $S$ is a del Pezzo surface of degree $9-n$ and $B$ is the labeled (marked) sum of its finitely many lines. When $n=6$, $Y(E_6)$ is the classical moduli space of marked cubic surfaces dating back to the nineteenth century. We describe the compactifications of $Y(E_5)$ and $Y(E_6)$ by Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) weighted stable pairs $(S,cB)$. There is a finite wall-and-chamber decomposition of the weight domain $\left(\frac{9-n}{N},1\right]$, and we explicitly identify this decomposition, as well as describe in detail the weighted stable pairs parameterized by the moduli spaces in each chamber. This generalizes the work of Hacking, Keel, and Tevelev constructing the moduli space and its universal family in the weight 1 case, and in particular yields a complete description of the fibers of this family.</description>

Using the canonical $S_n$-equivariant isomorphisms $\widetilde{H}^{i-1}(\Delta_{g,n};\mathbb{Q}) \cong W_0 H^i_c(\mathcal{M}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})$, we calculate the weight $0$, compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ in the range $g=3$ and $n\leq 9$, with partial computations available for $n\leq 13$.</description>

      <title>The $W(E_6)$-invariant birational geometry of the moduli space of marked cubic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space $Y = Y(E_6)$ of marked cubic surfaces is one of the most classical moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, dating back to the nineteenth century work of Cayley and Salmon. Modern interest in $Y$ was restored in the 1980s by Naruki's explicit construction of a $W(E_6)$-equivariant smooth projective compactification $\overline{Y}$ of $Y$, and in the 2000s by Hacking, Keel, and Tevelev's construction of the KSBA stable pair compactification $\widetilde{Y}$ of $Y$ as a natural sequence of blowups of $\overline{Y}$. We describe generators for the cones of $W(E_6)$-invariant effective divisors and curves of both $\overline{Y}$ and $\widetilde{Y}$. For Naruki's compactification $\overline{Y}$, we further obtain a complete stable base locus decomposition of the $W(E_6)$-invariant effective cone, and as a consequence find several new $W(E_6)$-equivariant birational models of $\overline{Y}$. Furthermore, we fully describe the log minimal model program for the KSBA compactification $\widetilde{Y}$, with respect to the divisor $K_{\widetilde{Y}} + cB + dE$, where $B$ is the boundary and $E$ is the sum of the divisors parameterizing marked cubic surfaces with Eckardt points.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \operatorname{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity.
  Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source.
  We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of elements of the Iwahori-Weyl group of a reductive group that we call positive Coxeter elements. This class consists of elements which are linked to partial Coxeter elements in the finite Weyl group in a certain canonical way, extending the more restrictive notion of finite Coxeter part previously introduced by He-Nie-Yu. We show that the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated with such elements have a very simple and explicitly described geometric structure. Conversely, we explain how some of these geometric properties can be used to characterize elements of positive Coxeter type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that $b$-Hurwitz numbers with a rational weight are obtained by taking an explicit limit of a Whittaker vector for the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra of type $A$. Our result is a vast generalization of several previous results that treated the monotone case, and the cases of quadratic and cubic polynomial weights. It also provides an interpretation of the associated Whittaker vector in terms of generalized branched coverings that might be of independent interest. Our result is new even in the special case $b=0$ that corresponds to classical hypergeometric Hurwitz numbers, and implies that they are governed by the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin. This gives an independent proof of the recent result of Bychkov-Dunin-Barkowski-Kazarian-Shadrin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Virtual Structure Constants and Generalizations of BCOV-Zinger Formula to Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Coherent sheaves on primitive multiple curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primitive multiple scheme is a Cohen-Macaulay scheme $Y$ such that the associated reduced scheme $X=Y_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $Y$ can be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If $I_X$ is the ideal sheaf of $X$ in $Y$ and $Y\not=X$, then $L=I_X/I_X^2$ is a line bundle on $X$, called the associated line bundle of $Y$.
  Even if $X$ is projective, $Y$ needs not to be quasi projective. We define in every case the reduced Hilbert polynomial $P_{red,O_X(1)}(E)$ of a coherent sheaf $E$ on $Y$, depending on the choice of an ample line bundle $O_X(1)$ on $X$. If $E$ is a flat family of sheaves on $Y$ parameterized by a smooth curve $C$, then $P_{red,O_X(1)}(E_c)$ does not depend on $c\in C$. We study flat families of sheaves in two important cases: the families of quasi locally free sheaves, and if $n=2$ those of balanced sheaves. Balanced sheaves are generalizations of vector bundles on $Y$, and could be used to expand already known moduli spaces of vector bundles on $Y$.
  When $X$ is a smooth projective surface, and $Y$ is of multiplicity 2 we study the simplest examples of balanced sheaves: the sheaves $E$ such that there is an exact sequence \[0\longrightarrow I_P\otimes L\longrightarrow E\longrightarrow I_P=E_{|X} \longrightarrow 0 \ , \] where $I_P\subset O_X$ is the ideal sheaf of a point $P\in X$. They can also be described as the ideal sheaves $E$ of subschemes of $Y$ concentrated on $P$, and such that $E_P$ is generated by two elements whose images in $O_{X,P}$ generate the maximal ideal. There is a moduli space for such sheaves, which is an affine bundle on $X$ with associated vector bundle $T_X\otimes L$ (where $T_X$ is the tangent bundle of $X$). The associated class in $H^1(X,T_X\otimes L)$ can be determined.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>

Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.00118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spaces of twisted conformal blocks attached to a $\Gamma$-curve $\Sigma$ with marked $\Gamma$-orbits and an action of $\Gamma$ on a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group. We prove that if $\Gamma$ stabilizes a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, then Propagation Theorem and Factorization Theorem hold. We endow a flat projective connection on the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks attached to a smooth family of pointed $\Gamma$-curves; in particular, it is locally free. We also prove that the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks on the stable compactification of Hurwitz stack is locally free.
  Let $\mathscr{G}$ be the parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme on the quotient curve $\Sigma/\Gamma$ obtained via the $\Gamma$-invariance of Weil restriction associated to $\Sigma$ and the simply-connected simple algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that the space of twisted conformal blocks can be identified with the space of generalized theta functions on the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic $\mathscr{G}$-torsors on $\Sigma/\Gamma$ when the level $c$ is divisible by $|\Gamma|$ (establishing a conjecture due to Pappas-Rapoport).</description>

      <title>On the complexity of Chow and Hurwitz forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the bit complexity of computing Chow forms and their generalization to multiprojective spaces. We develop a deterministic algorithm using resultants and obtain a single exponential complexity upper bound. Earlier computational results for Chow forms were in the arithmetic complexity model, and our result represents the first bit complexity bound. We also extend our algorithm to Hurwitz forms in projective space, and explore connections between multiprojective Hurwitz forms and matroid theory. The motivation for our work comes from incidence geometry where intriguing computational algebra problems remain open.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the dg algebra of global functions on commuting stacks of complex reductive groups using tools from Betti Geometric Langlands. In particular, we prove that the ring of invariant functions on the commuting scheme is reduced. Our main technical results include: a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the cocenter of the affine Hecke category; and the calculation of endomorphisms of a Whittaker sheaf in a diagram organizing parabolic induction of character sheaves.</description>

      <title>A novel algebraic approach to time-reversible evolutionary models</title>

Abstract: In the last years, algebraic tools have been proven useful in phylogenetic reconstruction and model selection through the study of phylogenetic invariants. However, up to now, the models studied from an algebraic viewpoint are either too general or too restrictive (as group-based models with a uniform stationary distribution) to be used in practice.
  In this paper we provide a new framework to study time-reversible models, which are the most widely used by biologists. In our approach we consider algebraic time-reversible models on phylogenetic trees (as defined by Allman and Rhodes) and introduce a new inner product to make all transition matrices of the process diagonalizable through the same orthogonal eigenbasis. This framework generalizes the Fourier transform widely used to work with group-based models and recovers some of the well known results. As illustration, we combine our technique with algebraic geometry tools to provide relevant phylogenetic invariants for trees evolving under the Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let \({\mathbb K}\) be any field, let \(X\subset {\mathbb P}^{k-1}\) be a set of \(n\) distinct \({\mathbb K}\)-rational points, and let \(a\geq 1\) be an integer. In this paper we find lower bounds for the minimum distance \(d(X)_a\) of the evaluation code of order \(a\) associated to \(X\). The first results use \(\alpha(X)\), the initial degree of the defining ideal of \(X\), and the bounds are true for any set \(X\). In another result we use \(s(X)\), the minimum socle degree, to find a lower bound for the case when \(X\) is in general linear position. In both situations we improve and generalize known results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute a formula for the $a$-number of curve $\mathbb{X}$ given by the equation $y^{q^2 + q + 1} = x^{q^2 + 1} - x^q$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. The $a$-number is an invariant of the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. In this paper, we compute a closed formula for the $a$-number of $\mathbb{X}$ using the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathbb{X}, \Omega^1)$.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena are that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- ``phases'' of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them glasses and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>
