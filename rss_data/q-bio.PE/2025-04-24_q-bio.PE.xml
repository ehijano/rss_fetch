      <title>SLiM-Gym: Reinforcement Learning for Population Genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SLiM-Gym, a Python package for integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with forward-time population genetic simulations. Wright-Fisher evolutionary dynamics offer a tractable framework for modeling populations across discrete generations, yet applying RL to these systems requires a compatible training environment. SLiM-Gym connects the standardized RL interface provided by Gymnasium with the high-fidelity evolutionary simulations of SLiM, allowing agents to interact with evolving populations in real time. This framework enables the development and evaluation of RL-based strategies for understanding evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>Enumerative combinatorics of unlabeled and labeled time-consistent galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mathematical phylogenetics, the time-consistent galled trees provide a simple class of rooted binary network structures that can be used to represent a variety of different biological phenomena. We study the enumerative combinatorics of unlabeled and labeled time-consistent galled trees. We present a new derivation via the symbolic method of the number of unlabeled time-consistent galled trees with a fixed number of leaves and a fixed number of galls. We also derive new generating functions and asymptotics for labeled time-consistent galled trees.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear contagion dynamics on dynamical networks: exact solutions ranging from consensus times to evolutionary trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nonlinear social contagion dynamics on dynamical networks, such as opinion formation, is crucial for gaining new insights into consensus and polarization. Similar to threshold-dependent complex contagions, the nonlinearity in adoption rates poses challenges for mean-field approximations. To address this theoretical gap, we focus on nonlinear binary-opinion dynamics on dynamical networks and analytically derive local configurations, specifically the distribution of opinions within any given focal individual's neighborhood. This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network degree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times and evolutionary trajectories. Our counterintuitive results reveal that neither biased assimilation (i.e., nonlinear adoption rates) nor preferences in local network rewiring -- such as in-group bias (preferring like-minded individuals) and the Matthew effect (preferring social hubs) -- can significantly slow down consensus. Among these three social factors, we find that biased assimilation is the most influential in accelerating consensus. Furthermore, our analytical method efficiently and precisely predicts the evolutionary trajectories of adoption curves arising from nonlinear contagion dynamics. Our work paves the way for enabling analytical predictions for general nonlinear contagion dynamics beyond opinion formation.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of multiple ecDNA types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can drive oncogene amplification, gene expression and intratumor heterogeneity, representing a major force in cancer initiation and progression. The phenomenon becomes even more intricate as distinct types of ecDNA present within a single cancer cell. While exciting as a new and significant observation across various cancer types, there is a lack of a general framework capturing the dynamics of multiple ecDNA types theoretically. Here, we present novel mathematical models investigating the proliferation and expansion of multiple ecDNA types in a growing cell population. By switching on and off a single parameter, we model different scenarios including ecDNA species with different oncogenes, genotypes with same oncogenes but different point mutations and phenotypes with identical genetic compositions but different functions. We analyse the fraction of ecDNA-positive and free cells as well as how the mean and variance of the copy number of cells carrying one or more ecDNA types change over time. Our results showed that switching does not play a role in the fraction and copy number distribution of total ecDNA-positive cells, if selection is identical among different ecDNA types. In addition, while cells with multiple ecDNA cannot be maintained in the scenario of ecDNA species without extra fitness advantages, they can persist and even dominate the ecDNA-positive population if switching is possible.</description>
