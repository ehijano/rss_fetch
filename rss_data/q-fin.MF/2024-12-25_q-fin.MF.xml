      <title>Dynamic Mean-Variance Asset Allocation in General Incomplete Markets A Nonlocal BSDE-based Feedback Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies dynamic mean-variance (MV) asset allocation problems in general incomplete markets. Besides of the conventional MV objective on portfolio's terminal wealth, our framework can accommodate running MV objectives with general (non-exponential) discounting factors while in general, any time-dependent preferences. We attempt the problem with a game-theoretic framework while decompose the equilibrium control policies into two parts: the first part is a myopic strategy characterized by a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind and the second part reveals the hedging demand governed by a system of nonlocal backward stochastic differential equations. We manage to establish the well-posedness of the solutions to the two aforementioned equations in tailored Bananch spaces by the fixed-point theorem. It allows us to devise a numerical scheme for solving for the equilibrium control policy with guarantee and to conclude that the dynamic (equilibrium) mean-variance policy in general settings is well-defined. Our probabilistic approach allows us to consider a board range of stochastic factor models, such as the Chan--Karolyi--Longstaff--Sanders (CKLS) model. For which, we verify all technical assumptions and provide a sound numerical scheme. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our framework.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework for modelling CLMM dynamics in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) within a continuous-time setting. We model the evolution of liquidity profiles as measure-valued processes and characterize their dynamics under continuous trading. Our analysis encompasses two critical aspects of CLMMs: the mechanics of concentrated liquidity provision and the strategic behavior of arbitrageurs. We examine three distinct arbitrage models -- myopic, finite-horizon, and infinite-horizon with discounted and ergodic controls -- and derive closed-form solutions for optimal arbitrage strategies under each scenario. Importantly, we demonstrate that the presence of trading fees fundamentally constrains the admissible price processes, as the inclusion of fees precludes the existence of diffusion terms in the price process to avoid infinite fee generation. This finding has significant implications for CLMM design and market efficiency.</description>
