      <title>Kiselman Minimum Principle and Rooftop Envelopes in Complex Hessian Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a semipositive $(1,1)$-form in Euclidean domains, providing a significant element in understanding geodesics within the context of complex Hessian equations. Based on the foundational Perron envelope construction, we prove a decomposition of $m$-subharmonic solutions, and a general comparison principle that effectively manages singular Hessian measures. Additionally, we establish a rooftop equality and an analogue of the Kiselman minimum principle, which are crucial ingredients in establishing a criterion for geodesic connectivity among $m$-subharmonic functions, expressed in terms of their asymptotic envelopes.</description>

      <title>Paley-Wiener Type Theorems associated to Dirac Operators of Riesz-Feller type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates Paley-Wiener-type theorems in the context of hypercomplex variables. To this end, we introduce and study the so-called generalized Bernstein spaces endowed by the fractional Dirac operator $D_{\alpha}^{\theta}$ - a space-fractional operator of order $\alpha$ and skewness $\theta$, encompassing the Dirac operator $D$. We will show that such family of function spaces seamlessly characterizes the interplay between Clifford-valued $L^p-$functions satisfying the support condition $\mathrm{supp}\ \widehat{f}\subseteq B(0,R)$, and the solutions of the Cauchy problems endowed by the space-time operator $\partial_{x_0}+D_\theta^\alpha$ that are of exponential type $R^\alpha$. Such construction allows us to generalize, in a meaningful way, the results obtained by Kou and Qian (2002) and Franklin, Hogan and Larkin (2017). Noteworthy, the exploitation of the well-known Kolmogorov-Stein inequalities to hypercomplex variables permits us to make the computation of the maximal radius $R$ for which $\mathrm{supp}\ \widehat{f}$ is compactly supported in $B(0,R)$ rather explicit.</description>

      <title>Computing Chebyshev polynomials using the complex Remez algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the generalized Remez algorithm, initially suggested by P. T. P. Tang, to perform an experimental study of Chebyshev polynomials in the complex plane. Our focus lies particularly on the examination of their norms and zeros. What sets our study apart is the breadth of examples considered, coupled with the fact that the degrees under investigation are substantially higher than those in previous studies where other methods have been applied. These computations of Chebyshev polynomials of high degrees reveal discernible patterns which allow for conjectures to be formulated based on abundant experimental evidence. The use of Tang's algorithm allows for computations executed with precision, maintaining accuracy within quantifiable margins of error. Additionally, as a result of our experimental study, we propose what we believe to be a fundamental relationship between Chebyshev and Faber polynomials associated with a compact set.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Three-Forms on Symplectic Six-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometry associated with 3-forms of various orbital type on a symplectic 6-manifold. We show that there are extremely rich geometric structures attached to certain unstable 3-forms arising naturally from degeneration of Calabi-Yau structures, which in turn provides us a new perspective towards the SYZ conjecture. We give concrete examples and demonstrate that the limiting behavior of the Type IIA flow can be used to detect canonical geometric structures on symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Entropy for Monge-Amp\`ere Measures in the Prescribed Singularities Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we generalize the notion of entropy for potentials in a relative full Monge-Amp\`ere mass $\mathcal{E}(X, \theta, \phi)$, for a model potential $\phi$. We then investigate stability properties of this condition with respect to blow-ups and perturbation of the cohomology class. We also prove a Moser-Trudinger type inequality with general weight and we show that functions with finite entropy lie in a relative energy class $\mathcal{E}^{\frac{n}{n-1}}(X, \theta, \phi)$ (provided $n&gt;1$), while they have the same singularities of $\phi$ when $n=1$.</description>

      <title>The complex structure of the Teichm\"uller space of circle diffeomorphisms in the Zygmund smooth class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the complex Banach manifold structure for the Teichmueller space of circle diffeomorphisms whose derivatives are in the Zygmund class. This is done by showing that the Schwarzian derivative map is a holomorphic split submersion. We prove similar results for the pre-Schwarzian derivative map and investigate the fiber space over the Teichmueller space. Especially, we show that this projection is also a holomorphic split submersion and induces the structure of a disk bundle. Finally, we introduce the little Zygmund class and consider the closed subspace given by this family of mappings in the Teichmueller space.</description>

      <title>Exploring Holomorphic Retracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is towards systematically characterizing (holomorphic) retracts of domains of holomorphy; to begin with, bounded balanced pseudoconvex domains $B \subset \mathbb{C}^N$. Specifically, we show that every retract of $B$ passing through its center (origin), is the graph of a holomorphic map over a linear subspace of $B$. As for retracts not passing through origin, we obtain the following result: if $B$ is a strictly convex ball and $\rho$ any holomorphic retraction map on $B$ which is submersive at its center, then $Z=\rho(B)$ is the graph of a holomorphic map over a linear subspace of $B$. To deal with a case when $\partial B$ may fail to have sufficiently many extreme points, we consider products of strictly convex balls, with respect to various norms and obtain a complete description of retracts passing through its center. This can be applied to solve a special case of the union problem with a degeneracy, namely: to characterize those Kobayashi corank one complex manifolds $M$ which can be expressed as an increasing union of submanifolds which are biholomorphic to a prescribed homogeneous bounded balanced domain. Results about non-existence of retracts of each possible dimension is established for the simplest non-convex but pseudoconvex domain: the `$\ell^q$-ball' for $0&lt;q&lt;1$; this enables an illustration of applying retracts to establishing biholomorphic inequivalences. To go beyond balanced domains, we then first obtain a complete characterization of retracts of the Hartogs triangle and `analytic complements' thereof. Thereafter, similar characterization results for domains which are neither bounded nor topologically trivial. We conclude by reporting some results on the retracts of $\mathbb{C}^2$.</description>
