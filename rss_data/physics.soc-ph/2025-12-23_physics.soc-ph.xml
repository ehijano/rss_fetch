      <title>Remarks on Legal Entanglement: No-Signaling, Local Operations, and Legal Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Godfrey and Sichelman propose a quantum-inspired framework, legal entanglement, to model coupled legal relations and interpretations, with quantitative proxies for modularity and information cost. We identify a specific technical issue in their account of formulative entanglement: legislation is modeled as a local operation on subsystem A that changes the reduced state of a distant entangled subsystem B (rho_B' != rho_B) prior to any measurement at B, presented as a departure from quantum no-signaling. In standard quantum mechanics, however, no-signaling holds for all local, trace-preserving operations, not only unitaries. This note states the correct no-signaling result, locates where the mapping becomes inconsistent, and proposes a repair that preserves the legal intuition: treat legislation as (i) a global update of the rule or constraint structure (altering the admissible state space or observables), and or (ii) an LOCC-style process (local operations plus public dissemination of authoritative classical information). We also connect this to an updating-first perspective that helps separate (a) physical locality or no-signaling from (b) institutional or semantic constraint propagation in legal systems.</description>

      <title>Physicists Joke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a reconstructed English edition of the seminal humor anthology \textbf{Physicists Joke} (\textbf{Fiziki Shutyat}), originally published in the USSR in 1966. While the Soviet edition served as a significant cultural artifact of the 1960s, a large portion of its content consisted of Russian translations of articles originally written in English. To avoid the loss of nuance inherent in back-translation, this edition does not simply translate the Russian text. Instead, the original English source materials have been identified and restored from archives of journals such as \textbf{Physics Today}, \textbf{The Journal of Irreproducible Results}, \textbf{New Scientist}, and \textbf{Proceedings of the IEEE}. The specific structural framework of the 1966 book has been preserved, along with English translations of the unique Russian scientific folklore, anecdotes, and editorial interludes compiled by the original Soviet editors. This collection offers a glimpse into the sociology of science and the shared professional culture of the "Golden Age" of mid-20th-century physics.</description>

      <title>Why Locking Up Cartel Members Does not Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the core strategies to reduce cartel violence is by directly targeting members with law enforcement. Whether targeting leaders, disrupting parts of the organisation, or incarcerating members, the purpose is to reduce the strength of cartels directly. Most security strategies result in increased incarceration rates. Yet its effectiveness in addressing organised crime remains unclear, particularly if it fails to prevent recidivism upon release from jail. Here, a model is constructed to quantify cartel participation across generations, where individuals are recruited, age over time, and exit cartels as victims of a homicide or due to incapacitation, or retirement. Incarcerating cartel members prevents less than 10% of cartel offences. Additionally, doubling penalties would reduce cartel members' potential by less than 5%, thereby challenging proposals for stricter rules. Yet, rehabilitation after prison, often neglected as an integral part of the security strategy, could be more effective in lowering cartel crimes.</description>

      <title>Equivalent bounded confidence processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bounded confidence model the opinions of a set of agents evolve over discrete time steps. In each round an agent averages the opinion of all agents whose opinions are at most a certain threshold apart. Here we assume that the opinions of the agents are elements of the real line. The details of the dynamics are determined by the initial opinions of the agents, i.e. a starting configuration, and the mentioned threshold -- both allowing uncountable infinite possibilities. Recently it was observed that for each starting configuration the set of thresholds can be partitioned into a finite number of intervals such that the evolution of opinions does not depend on the precise value of the threshold within one of the intervals. So, we may say that, given a starting configuration of initial opinions, there is only a finite number of equivalence classes of bounded confidence processes (and an algorithm to compute them). Here we systematically study different notions of equivalence. In our widest notion we can also get rid of the initial starting configuration and end up with a finite number of equivalent bounded confidence processes for each given (finite) number of agents. This allows to precisely study the occurring phenomena for small numbers of agents without the jeopardy of missing interesting cases by performing numerical experiments. We exemplarily study the freezing time, i.e. number of time steps needed until the process stabilizes, and the degree of fragmentation, i.e. the number of different opinions that survive once the process has reached its final state.</description>

      <title>Relations Among Different Inequality Measures in Complex Systems: From Kinetic Exchange to Earthquake Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of several inequality measures across two kinetic wealth-exchange models with extreme inequality features (namely the Banerjee model, and the Chakraborti or Yard-Sale model) and two earthquake simulating models (namely the Chakrabarti-Stinchcombe two-fractal overlap model and the nonlinear dynamical Burridge-Knopoff model), and a synthetic Pareto distribution. For each model we compute numerically the Lorenz function for the respective models' wealth, overlap magnitude or avalanche distributions. We then estimate the variations of Gini (g), Pietra (p) and Kolkata (k) indices in these models with systematic variations of saving propensity (for the two wealth-exchange models), with systematic variations of generation or block numbers (for the two earthquake simulating models). We find, the values of p/(2k-1) (across the wealth exchange models and the two-fractal overlap model) remain a little above unity (theoretically predicted value) and deviating a little higher by a maximum of 4% near g = k nearly equal to 0.86, which was identified earlier to be the precursor point of criticality in several self-organized critical models (k = 0.80 corresponds to Pareto's 80-20 law). In the Burridge-Knopoff model for some instances of time, the value of p/(2k-1) drops a little below unity. This and some other quantitatively similar behaviors of the inequality indices across socio-economic and geophysical models may provide a coherent and comparative framework for identifying the subtle features in the statistics of such disparate dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging the divide: Economic exchange and segregation in dual-income cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segregation is a growing concern around the world. One of its main manifestations is the creation of ghettos, whose inhabitants have difficult access to well-paid jobs, which are often located far from their homes. In order to study this phenomenon, we propose an extension of Schelling's model of segregation to take into account the existence of economic exchanges. To approximate a geographical model of the city, we consider a small-world network with a defined real estate market. The evolution of the system has also been studied, finding that economic exchanges follow exponential laws and relocations are approximated by power laws. In addition to this, we consider the existence of delays in the actions of the agents, which mainly affect the happiness of those with fewer economic resources. Besides, the size of the economic exchange plays a crucial role in overall segregation. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model reproduces real-world situations such as the separation between favoured and handicapped economic areas, the importance of economic contacts between them to improve the distribution of wealth, and the existence of efficient and cheap transport to break the poverty cycles typical of disadvantaged zones.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Cooperation with Game Transitions via Markov Decision Chain in Networked Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual cooperative strategy influences the surrounding dynamic population, which in turn affects cooperative strategy. To better model this phenomenon, we develop a Markov decision chain based game transitions model and examine the dynamic transitions in game states of individuals within a network and their impact on the strategy's evolution. Additionally, we extend single-round strategy imitation to multiple rounds to better capture players' potential non-rational behavior. Using intensive simulations, we explore the effects of transition probabilities and game parameters on game transitions and cooperation. Our study finds that strategy-driven game transitions promote cooperation, and increasing the transition rates of Markov decision chains can significantly accelerate this process. By designing different Markov decision chains, these results provide simulation based guidance for practical applications in swarm intelligence, such as strategic collaboration.</description>

      <title>Various Vicsek Models with Underlying Network Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion is a fundamental phenomenon in biological swarms. As a framework for studying synchronization in motions, the Vicsek model is simple and efficient, assuming isotropic interactions with a complete field of view. Drawing inspiration from natural swarms, we incorporate realistic constraints into the model. By analysing the interaction structures from the complex network perspective, we demonstrate that models with the homogeneous interaction rules naturally form Erdos-Renyi networks, whereas the introduction of heterogeneity leads to Barabasi-Albert networks. Furthermore, we discover that the model's synchronization is fundamentally governed by the average degree of the interaction network. Through a comparative analysis across these topologies, we identify a stretched-exponential relationship between the average degree and the synchronization metrics.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Misinformation Propagation in Complex Networks: Topology-Dependent Distortion and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation is pervasive in natural, biological, social, and engineered systems, yet its quantitative characterization remains challenging.We develop a general mathematical framework for quantifying information distortion in distributed systems by modeling how local transmission errors accumulate along network geodesics and reshape each agent's perceived global state. Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks, and Barab\'asi--Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barab\'asi--Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities. We additionally show how sparsity constraints, structural organization, and connection costs delineate regimes of minimal misinformation.</description>

      <title>Stylized Facts and Their Microscopic Origins: Clustering, Persistence, and Stability in a 2D Ising Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of financial markets using models inspired by statistical physics offers a fruitful approach to understand collective and extreme phenomena [3, 14, 15] In this paper, we present a study based on a 2D Ising network model where each spin represents an agent that interacts only with its immediate neighbors plus a term reated to the mean field [1, 2]. From this simple formulation, we analyze the formation of spin clusters, their temporal persistence, and the morphological evolution of the system as a function of temperature [5, 19]. Furthermore, we introduce the study of the quantity $1/2P\sum_{i}|S_{i}(t)+S_{i}(t+\Delta t)|$, which measures the absolute overlap between consecutive configurations and quantifies the degree of instantaneous correlation between system states. The results show that both the morphology and persistence of the clusters and the dynamics of the absolute sum can explain universal statistical properties observed in financial markets, known as stylized facts [2, 12, 18]: sharp peaks in returns, distributions with heavy tails, and zero autocorrelation. The critical structure of clusters and their reorganization over time thus provide a microscopic mechanism that gives rise to the intermittency and clustered volatility observed in prices [2, 15].</description>

      <title>Monitoring and Evaluating Astronomy-for-Development Initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as a practical guide for individuals and organisations seeking to design, implement, and evaluate astronomy-for-development initiatives, as well as those preparing proposals for the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD) annual Call for Proposals. The paper aims to outline how systematic evidence collection can strengthen project design, enhance accountability, and increase the likelihood of measurable impact. It explains the distinction between monitoring and evaluation, provides guidance on when and how evaluation should be undertaken, and summarises key evaluation types - process, feasibility, impact, outcome, economic, and summative, relevant to astronomy-based interventions. In addition to conceptual discussion, the paper presents a set of practical steps, reflective questions, and examples to help project teams develop a clear theory of change, define appropriate indicators, and anticipate risks and unintended consequences. By contextualising M&amp;E within the broader goals of the OAD and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this work aims to empower practitioners to create evidence-informed, community-driven, and sustainable astronomy-for-development projects that deliver both local and global benefit.</description>

      <title>Topological Flux on a Context Manifold Generates Nonreciprocal Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions, where the influence of agent $i$ on $j$ differs from that of $j$ on $i$, are fundamental in active and living matter. Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior.</description>

Abstract: Individuals interact and cooperate in structured systems. Many studies represent this structure using static networks, where each link represents a permanent connection between two nodes. However, real interactions are generally not time-invariant and are often not pairwise. Recently, progress has been made in modeling higher-order interactions using hypergraphs, where a link may connect more than two individuals. Here, we study cooperation on temporal hypergraphs, capturing the time-varying, higher-order interactions seen in empirical systems. We find that temporal hypergraphs can promote cooperation compared with static networks, and the latter may even underestimate the cooperation-boosting effects of constrained, local interactions. We further show that cooperation can be facilitated by temporal hypergraphs with sparse components and higher-order interactions. Importantly, when the size of group interactions (hyperedges) is comparable to the population size, relatively small hyperedge sizes best facilitate cooperation. Synthetic and empirical hypergraphs alike affirm our findings, illuminating how temporal, higher-order interactions profoundly shape the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00592v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. As shown by the pit-of-losses paradox identified in previous work, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments tend to reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of ``rejecting all proposals without voting'' outperforms majority voting. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments; here, the simple social decision rule of ``accepting all proposals without voting'' is superior to majority voting. We prove that, under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and under the antisymmetry of the voting body, this second pit of losses is a mirror image of the one arising in hostile environments, and we explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists who support all proposals that increase their personal capital and a group (or groups) whose members vote to increase their group's wealth. According to the key lemma, the expected capital gain of each agent under the social decision rule when the random gain generator is $X$ with mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds their expected gain under the reflected generator $-X$ by exactly $\mu$. This extends to location-scale families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. This result reveals a mirror symmetry in the performance of the symmetrized majority rule relative to a baseline rule. The baseline rule accepts all proposals in favorable environments and rejects them in unfavorable (hostile) ones.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus formation is a central problem in collective behavior. In this work, we develop quantum models of opinion dynamics that can be exactly solved and implemented on current quantum hardware. By exploiting quantum superposition, measurement-induced state collapse, and entanglement, our framework captures key features of opinion evolution and allows a systematic investigation of how network connectivity shapes consensus formation. We demonstrate our approach using practical quantum circuits and validate representative cases on IBM Quantum devices for the open-chain. Further results demonstrate that quantum platforms can serve as a viable framework for simulating opinion dynamics and for probing the interplay between leadership, network structure, and collective behavior.</description>

      <title>A dual approach to proving electoral fraud using statistics and forensic evidence (Dvojnoe dokazatel'stvo falsifikazij na vyborah statistikoj i kriminalistikoj)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electoral fraud often manifests itself as statistical anomalies in election results, yet its extent can rarely be reliably confirmed by other evidence. Here we report the complete results of municipal elections in the town of Vlasikha near Moscow, where we observe both statistical irregularities in the vote-counting transcripts and forensic evidence of tampering with ballots during their overnight storage. We evaluate two types of statistical signatures in the vote sequence that can prove batches of fraudulent ballots have been injected. We find that pairs of factory-made security bags with identical serial numbers are used in this fraud scheme. At 8 out of our 9 polling stations, the statistical and forensic evidence agrees (identifying 7 as fraudulent and 1 as honest), while at the remaining station the statistical evidence detects the fraud while the forensic one is insufficient. We also illustrate that the use of tamper-indicating seals at elections is inherently unreliable.</description>
