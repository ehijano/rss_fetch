      <title>An Efficient Wavelet-based Physics Informed Residual Neural Networks for Flow Field Reconstruction with Extremely Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces wavelet-physics-informed residual neural networks (W-PIRNNs) to study complex fluid flow problems by reconstructing the flow field from highly sparse, supervised data. Our W-PIRNNs fundamentally integrate ResNet and employ the wavelet $W(t) = w_1 \sin(t) + w_2 \cos(t)$ as an activation function. Due to the vanishing and ballooning gradient problems associated with typical PINNs' deep networks, we implemented residual-based skip connections. Our W-PIRNNs, which integrate supervised data with physical principles, demonstrate efficacy even in scenarios of sparse or partial data, enabling the reconstruction of flow fields using merely $0.05\%$ velocity data for training. The wake flow around a circular cylinder served as the test case for our proposed technique, which depends exclusively on velocity data for training. This technique facilitates the precise reconstruction of velocity, pressure, streamlines, and vorticity, requiring fewer epochs and less processing time. Significantly, our proposed W-PIRNNs effectively resolve PDEs in both forward and inverse contexts. Burger's equation served as a test case for both the forward and inverse problem configurations. Our network calculates the diffusion or viscosity coefficient ($\lambda_2$) with an absolute error of $0.065\%$ and the convection coefficient ($\lambda_1$) with an absolute error of $0.002\%$. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger equation is examined in the forward setting to assess the framework's ability to handle periodic boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, W-PIRNNs represent the first method capable of flow reconstruction using highly sparse supervised data, as well as reconstructing streamline and vorticity, and they effectively address both forward and inverse problems with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A theoretical model for oceanic submesoscales under next-order effects of strain and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submesoscale currents in the oceanic mixed layer, comprising fronts, eddies, and filaments, are characterized by $\textit{O}(1)$ Rossby numbers (Ro). These features, which constantly interact with background mesoscale flows and boundary layer turbulence (BLT), are critical for mediating vertical exchange between the surface and the ocean interior. Despite growing insight into their generation and evolution, the modification of initially balanced submesoscale dynamics by finite-Ro effects under the combined influence of mesoscale strain and BLT remains unresolved. In this study, we address this question through a perturbation analysis of two-dimensional, geostrophically adjusted oceanic fronts and filaments, adapting the analytical models of \citet{shakespeare_generalized_2013} and \citet{bodner_breakdown_2020}. This framework allows for a systematic exploration across a broad range of Rossby numbers Ro, Ekman numbers Ek, and strain parameters. The first-order solution under pure mesoscale strain exhibits clear frontogenesis and closely mirrors the full model dynamics during early inertial periods, despite the absence of an exponential collapse. Under BLT perturbation, the first-order solution confirms the distinct frontogenetic and frontolytic tendencies associated with eddy viscosity and diffusivity, respectively; however, no transition between these regimes is observed across the explored Ro and Ek parameter space for vertical mixing. When both strain and BLT perturbations are present, turbulent fluxes can strengthen, weaken, or even reverse strain-induced frontogenesis depending on the parameter regime. These results suggest that mixed-layer parameterizations must carefully account for the spatial variability of BLT within submesoscale currents to accurately capture frontal evolution under mesoscale strain.</description>

      <title>Convolutional causal learning for aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers capturing aerodynamic causality from snapshot data with a time-varying mode decomposition technique referred to as information-theoretic machine learning. The current approach extracts time-dependent informative vortical structures, contributing to the future evolution of the aerodynamic coefficients. The present decomposition is employed with a convolutional neural network, enabling the identification of the spatial continuous mode. In addition, a low-order representation, characterizing the informative vortical structures and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients, can also be identified by considering autoencoder-based data compression. The present technique is applied to a range of aerodynamic examples, including extreme vortex-gust airfoil interactions, experimentally measured transverse jet-wing interaction, and a turbulent separated wake. For the cases of gust-wing interaction, the time-varying gust effect on the lift response is extracted in an interpretable manner. With the example of a turbulent wake, the relationship between large-scale vortical motion and lift force is identified without any spatial length-scale information. The proposed approach could serve as a foundation for data-driven causal modeling and control for a range of unsteady flows.</description>

      <title>A new form of mixing in turbulent sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sedimentation of finite-size inertial particles in a Rayleigh-Taylor-like setup using state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations. The falling particles are observed to produce two distinct regions: a leading mixing layer with a linear concentration profile followed by a bulk region of uniform density. Unlike classical RT turbulence, the mixing layer extension accelerates with an anomalous, non-integer exponent, while the bulk region moves at a constant velocity. A one-dimensional model based on a local hindered settling law accurately captures the observed dynamics and its dependence on the particle-to-fluid density ratio. The present work identifies a new regime of convective mixing which develops at the front of particle suspensions in sedimentation processes.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformer operator for the prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven turbulence prediction methods often face challenges related to data dependency and lack of physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\% and 91.3\% while requiring only 31.5\% and 3.1\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO. Moreover, both PITO and PIITO models are much faster compared to traditional LES method.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Free Diffusion Models for Incompressible Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models are extensively used in unsupervised and self-supervised machine learning with the aim to generate new samples from a probability distribution estimated with a set of known samples. They have demonstrated impressive results in replicating dense, real-world contents such as images, musical pieces, or human languages. This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training. In particular, these results illustrate the ability of diffusion models to reproduce the main statistical characteristics of Kolmogorov turbulence in scenarios departing from the ones they were trained on.</description>

      <title>Inertial effects on the interphase drag force and rheology of dilute suspensions of buoyant droplets at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the hydrodynamic force and the first and second moments of force acting on a translating spherical droplet immersed in a uniform flow using the reciprocal theorem. We consider the low but finite Reynolds number regime, $Re = a U \rho_f / \mu_f$, and the dilute limit of small droplet volume fraction $\phi$. Here, $U$ denotes the magnitude of the relative velocity between the phases, $a$ the droplet radius, and $\rho_f$ and $\mu_f$ the density and viscosity of the continuous phase, respectively. We show that the $O(Re)$ inertial corrections to the first and second moments of force scale as $O(\rho_f \phi U^2)$ and $O(a\rho_f\phi U^2)$, respectively. Moreover, the ensemble average of the drag force and the higher-order force moments over the distribution of droplet velocities introduces additional contributions proportional to the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, both in the interphase momentum exchange and in the effective stress of the continuous phase. As a consequence, in dilute emulsions of buoyant droplets, the effective stress depends quadratically on the relative velocity between the phases, on the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, and on the spatial gradients of these quantities.</description>

      <title>Development of strongly nonlinear structures at the charged boundary of a non-conducting liquid in an electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of the strongly nonlinear stages of instability development for a non-conducting liquid with a charged free surface in a normal electric field is performed. It is demonstrated that two main stages of the instability can be distinguished: an initial stage, during which dimples appear on the surface, and a developed stage, during which these dimples transform into expanding bubbles. The bubble size increases with increasing applied field, despite the fact that the scale corresponding to the dominant mode of the instability decreases.</description>

      <title>Investigating the mechanism by which finite-size heavy particles are entrained in turbulent open channel flow over a smooth surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of entrainment of finite-size heavy particles in a turbulent open channel flow over a smooth surface are analyzed. Three types of simulations, namely with freely moving, rotation-constrained, and spanwise-motion-constrained particles, were conducted using particle-resolved direct numerical simulations. With the aid of a relative velocity suitably defined in the vicinity of the finite-size particle, we decompose the hydrodynamic force into drag and lift contributions and evaluate the local wall-normal shear rate around the particles. By means of coherent structure eduction techniques, we investigate flow structures before and during lift-off events. Rotation-constrained simulations revealed the insignificance of particle rotation in the entrainment mechanism. Spanwise-motion-constrained simulations revealed the importance of particle location with respect to flow structures with apparent changes in entrainment frequency, duration of the entrainment process, wall-normal shear around the particles, and distance to the nearest vortical structures during lift-off. The contribution of lift to the wall-normal force is found to be responsible for the initiation of particle entrainment, which is induced by a high-shear event associated with fast-moving fluid. The presence of quasi-streamwise vortices is shown to be an important ingredient for the entrainment of particles into the bulk flow. The results show that, at marginal Shields number values, a high wall-normal shear rate and the proximity of an intense quasi-streamwise vortex are essential elements of the entrainment mechanism.</description>

      <title>Unveiling crown-finger instability of a non-spherical drop impacting a liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional numerical study of the splashing dynamics of non-spherical droplets impacting a quiescent liquid film, covering a wide range of aspect ratios (Ar) and Weber numbers (We). The simulations reveal distinct impact dynamics, such as spreading, splashing type-1, splashing type-2, and canopy formation, which are delineated in a regime map constructed in the Ar-We parameter space. Our results demonstrate that droplet morphology during the impact significantly influences crown evolution and splash initiation, with oblate drops promoting finger growth and fragmentation due to enhanced rim deceleration, while prolate drops tend to form canopies. We observe that the hole instability, which becomes more prominent at higher Weber numbers, arises from lamella rupture in the thinnest region of the film, located just beneath the crown rim. A linear stability analysis, supplemented by the temporal evolution of the crown obtained from the numerical simulations, adequately predicts the number of fingers formed along the crown rim by accounting for both Rayleigh-Plateau (RP) and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the dominant role of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in determining the number and wavelength of early undulations, with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability serving to amplify the growth rate of the disturbances. Our findings highlight the critical role of the droplet shape in splash dynamics, which is relevant to a range of applications involving droplet impact.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of simultaneous pair-drop impacts and their energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of the simultaneous impact of two identical drops on an hydrophobic substrate, varying the relative strength of capillary and viscous effects respectively through Weber and Reynolds numbers of impact. The interaction between the two drops is characterized by the appearance of a lamella arising from the collision of the two droplets' spreading rims. We examine the width, the height, and the general morphological evolution of the central sheet; the numerical data is validated against prior experiments and used to guide the development of an energetic model for the maximum elevation of the central sheet. In particular, the rise of the central sheet resembles the spreading behaviour single-drop impacts, especially at high Weber and Reynolds numbers. This fact can be used to estimate scalings in the capillary- and viscous-dominated regimes, which can be used to collapse the trajectories. These insights provide a route for a more complete understanding of the dynamics for the central rising sheet, and anticipate the detailed study of its fragmentation characteristics</description>

      <title>Strain-transport superposition in shear-thinning dense non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear thinning in dense non-Brownian suspensions is often attributed to shear-induced microstructural evolution, including changes in alignment, anisotropy, and near-contact statistics, yet how these changes influence particle-scale dynamics remains unclear. Using particle-resolved simulations of dense suspensions that shear thin through diverse microscopic mechanisms, including short-range attraction, repulsion, and load-dependent friction, we show that the magnitude of nonaffine particle velocities is controlled solely by the imposed shear rate, independent of coordination number, structural anisotropy, and interaction details. In contrast, macroscopic stress and viscosity remain strongly sensitive to the underlying interactions. When mean-squared displacements transverse to the flow are rescaled by accumulated strain and the nonaffine velocity variance, all data collapse onto a single master curve, revealing strain-controlled transport with a robust ballistic-to-diffusive crossover. These results demonstrate a fundamental decoupling between particle-scale kinematics and macroscopic rheology and identify nonaffine velocity fluctuations as the emergent dynamical scale governing shear-driven transport.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Discretize-then-Project Reduced Order Model for Turbulent Flows on Collocated Grids with Data-Driven Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for turbulent incompressible flows on collocated finite volume grids. The methodology employs the "discretize-then-project" consistent flux strategy, which ensures mass conservation and pressure-velocity coupling without requiring auxiliary stabilization like boundary control or pressure stabilization techniques. However, because standard Galerkin projection fails to yield physically consistent results for the turbulent viscosity field, a hybrid strategy is adopted: velocity and pressure are resolved via intrusive projection, while the turbulent viscosity is reconstructed using a non-intrusive data-driven closure. We evaluate three neural network architectures, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the temporal evolution of the viscosity coefficients. Validated against a 3D Large Eddy Simulation of a lid-driven cavity, the LSTM-based closure demonstrates superior performance in capturing transient dynamics, achieving relative errors of 0.7\% for velocity and 4\% for turbulent viscosity. The resulting framework effectively combines the mathematical rigor of the consistent flux formulation with the adaptability of deep learning for turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St&lt;=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St&lt;=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Behavior of Non-spherical Particles in Confined Vertical Flows: A Resolved CFD-DEM Study</title>

Abstract: We investigate the sedimentation and vertical hydraulic transport of irregular polymetallic nodules (PMNs) using resolved CFD-DEM with multisphere particles spanning $100 &lt; Re_p &lt; 3000$. Shape effects induce 2.0-2.3 times drag enhancement relative to volume-equivalent spheres, arising from 50\% larger frontal areas and wake asymmetry, reducing terminal velocities by 29-33\%. Vertical transport exhibits velocity-driven transitions from intermittent settling to stable convection, as demonstrated by residence-time and drag-force statistics. While PMNs exhibit enhanced rotational-translational coupling and broader force fluctuations, the regime progression qualitatively resembles that of volume-equivalent spherical particles. Drag variance evolution reveals contrasting behavior: small particles $(d/D=0.082)$ show narrow distributions and wake suppression at higher velocities, while large particles $(d/D=0.22)$ exhibit non-monotonic variance. These findings elucidate shape-confinement interactions in vertical transport and establish bounds on the applicability of volume-equivalent spherical particles in reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>On the influence of forced homogeneous-isotropic turbulence on the settling and clustering of finite-size particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of heavy particles with a diameter of several multiples of the Kolmogorov length scale in the presence of forced turbulence and gravity, resorting to interface-resolved DNS based on an IBM. The values of the particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such that strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of turbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale Reynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the absence of gravity. Here we detect a tendency to cluster with an intensity which is intermediate between these two limiting cases, meaning that forced background turbulence decreases the level of clustering otherwise observed under ambient settling. However, the clustering strength does not monotonously decay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which coherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed. It is argued that the reduced interaction time due to particle settling through the surrounding eddy (crossing trajectories) has the effect of shifting upwards the range of eddies with a time scale matching the characteristic time scale of the particle. In the present cases this shift might bring the particles into resonance with the energetic eddies of the turbulent spectrum. Concerning the average particle settling velocity we find very small deviations from the value obtained for an isolated particle in ambient fluid when defining the relative velocity as an apparent slip velocity (i.e. as the difference between the averages computed separately for the velocities of each phase). This is consistent with simple estimates of the non-linear drag effect. However, the relative velocity based upon the fluid velocity seen by each particle has on average a smaller magnitude (by 5-7%) than the ambient single-particle value.</description>

      <title>Passive cell body plays active roles in microalgal swimming via nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell body of flagellated microalgae is commonly considered to act merely as a passive load during swimming, and a larger body size would simply reduce the speed. In this work, we use numerical simulations based on a boundary element method to investigate the effect of body-flagella hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) on the swimming performance of the biflagellate, \textit{C. reinhardtii}. We find that body-flagella HIs significantly enhance the swimming speed and efficiency. As the body size increases, the competition between the enhanced HIs and the increased viscous drag leads to an optimal body size for swimming. Based on the simplified three-sphere model, we further demonstrate that the enhancement by body-flagella HIs arises from an effective non-reciprocity: the body affects the flagella more strongly during the power stroke, while the flagella affect the body more strongly during the recovery stroke. Our results have implications for both microalgal swimming and laboratory designs of biohybrid microrobots.</description>

      <title>Extending the Droplet-Wave Statistical Correspondence in Walking Droplet Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walking droplets -- millimetric oil droplets that self-propel across the surface of a vibrating fluid bath -- exhibit striking emergent statistics that remain only partially understood. In particular, in a variety of experiments, a robust correspondence has been observed between the droplet's statistical distribution and the time-average of the wave field that guides it. M. Durey, P. A. Milewski, and J. W. M. Bush, Chaos 28, 096108 (2018) rigorously established such a correspondence for single-droplet systems with a single, instantaneous droplet-bath impact during each vibration period, but numerical and experimental evidence suggests that the correspondence should hold far more broadly. Laboratory droplet systems, for instance, often exhibit complex bouncing modes that do not adhere to these hypotheses. We attempt to complete this program in the present work, rigorously extending this statistical correspondence to account for arbitrary droplet-bath impact models, multi-droplet interactions, and non-resonant bouncing. We investigate this correspondence numerically in systems of one and two droplets in 1-D geometries, and we highlight how the time-averaged wave field can distinguish between correlated and uncorrelated pairs of droplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small bubbles rising in a chain can self-organize into regular patterns upon reaching a liquid's free surface. This phenomenon is investigated through direct numerical simulations. By varying the bubble release period, distinct branching patterns characterized by different numbers of arms are observed. These macroscopic regular configurations arise from localized non-contact repulsion and pair collisions between bubbles as they arrive at the free-surface emergence site. A theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively relate the number of branches to the bubble release period. The model also predicts probabilities of observing specific arm counts in reality. This study provides insights into broader nonlinear pattern formation and self-organization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian viscous fluid models with learned rheology accurately reproduce Lagrangian sea ice simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar sea ice is crucial to Earth's climate system. Its dynamics also affect coastal communities, wildlife, and global shipping. Sea ice is typically modeled as a continuum fluid using a model proposed almost 50 years ago, which is moderately accurate for packed ice, but loses its predictive accuracy outside of the central ice pack. Discrete element methods (DEMs), which are commonly used for modeling granular media, offer an alternative by resolving the behavior of individual ice floes, including collisions, frictional contact, fracture, and ridging. However, DEMs are generally too costly for large-scale simulations. To address this, we present a framework for inferring rheological behavior from DEM velocity data. We characterize isotropic constitutive laws as scalar functions of the principal invariants of the strain-rate tensor. These functions are parameterized by neural networks trained on DEM data. By combining machine learning and finite element methods, we incorporate the governing partial differential equation (PDE) into the training, requiring to solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the network parameters. We focus on unidirectional parallel shear flows, which allow us to infer the effective shear viscosity. We find that, over a wide range of ice concentrations, the velocity fields observed in a complex sea ice DEM can be captured by a nonlinear rheology. Depending on the ice concentration, a shear-thinning or a shear-thickening behavior is observed. Moreover, the effective shear viscosity is found to increase by several orders of magnitude with changes as small as 5% in the sea ice concentration. We show that the learned rheology generalizes to different forcing scenarios, time-dependent problems, and settings in which compressibility is not a dominant factor.</description>

      <title>Bouncing to coalescence transition for droplet impact onto moving liquid pools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A droplet impacting a deep fluid bath is as common as rain over the ocean. If the impact is sufficiently gentle, the mediating air layer remains intact, and the droplet may rebound completely from the interface. In this work, we experimentally investigate the role of translational bath motion on the bouncing to coalescence transition. Over a range of parameters, we find that the relative bath motion systematically decreases the normal Weber number required to transition from bouncing to merging. Direct numerical simulations demonstrate that the depression created during impact combined with the translational motion of the bath enhances the air layer drainage on the upstream side of the droplet, ultimately favoring coalescence. A simple geometric argument is presented that rationalizes the collapse of the experimental threshold data, extending what is known for the case of axisymmetric normal impacts to the more general 3D scenario of interest herein.</description>

      <title>A paradox concerning the numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is predicted by traditional direct numerical simulation (DNS) using double precision arithmetic and a range of different time-steps. It is found that the the final flow type tends either to vortical flow or zonal flow, whose statistics are completely different. Notably, these two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step is reduced to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each turbulent flow type should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise exerts a huge influence on the final flow type and statistics of numerically simulated NS turbulence (i.e., turbulence governed by the NS equations) because the time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations, as a turbulence model per se, require all small stochastic disturbances for $t&gt;0$ to be negligible. This leads to a logical paradox in the underlying theory. Further investigations are recommended to reveal the essential differences between the exact solution of NS turbulence, numerical simulations of such NS turbulence, and the corresponding actual turbulence. It should be emphasized that NS turbulence is closely related to the fourth Millennium problem, and turbulence is an unsolved fundamental problem in classic mechanics. Hopefully this paradox would be helpful to deepen our understandings about the turbulence and the fourth Millennium problem.</description>

      <title>A Unified Numerical Framework for Turbulent Convection and Phase-Change Dynamics in Coupled Fluid-Porous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a unified numerical framework for simulating incompressible flows within the coupled fluid-porous-medium system and involving heat and solute transport and phase-changing process. A complete set of governing equations is established based on the Darcy-Brinkman equation, the advection-diffusion equations for heat and solute, and a phase field equation describing the evolution of porous medium. Phase-changing process and relevant influences are incorporated as corresponding source terms. A numerical method is then developed to solve the governing equations. Several different types of model problems are simulated with the numerical method. For the incompressible flows inside a coupled fluid-porous-medium system, the channel turbulence over a porous substrate and the thermal convection in a two-layer system are simulated. For the phase-changing flows, the one-dimensional Stefan problem and the two-dimensional flow of pure water freezing are tested. The results agree with the existing simulations. Finally, the full solver is used to simulate the growth of mushy ice during seawater freezing, which can successfully reproduce the experimental results at the exactly same conditions. Therefore, the developed framework provides a versatile and reliable tool for studying complex multiphase, multi-component transport phenomena in fluid-porous-medium systems involving solid-liquid phase change.</description>

      <title>Liouville Spectral Gap and Bifurcation Driven Lagrangian Eulerian Decoupling with Nondiffusive Turbulence Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of motion, although formally equivalent, become statistically decoupled. In this work, by invoking Liouville theorem, we show that the joint probability density function (PDF) of the Eulerian and Lagrangian fields, evolving from arbitrary initial conditions, relaxes exponentially toward a factorized form given by the product of the corresponding marginal PDFs. This relaxation is governed by a genuine spectral gap of the Liouville operator, whose magnitude is primarily set by the bifurcation rate of the velocity gradient dynamics, whereas the contribution of Lyapunov exponents is shown to be significantly smaller. As a consequence, Eulerian Lagrangian correlations decay rapidly, and if the joint PDF is initially factorized, its factorized structure is preserved at all subsequent times, with each marginal evolving independently under the corresponding dynamics. We further show that the formal equivalence between the two descriptions implies the invariance of the relative kinetic energy between arbitrarily chosen points. When combined with the asymmetric statistics of instantaneous finite scale Lyapunov exponents in incompressible turbulence, this property provides a quantitative interpretation of particle pair separation and of the turbulent energy cascade.
  Finally, these results naturally lead to nondiffusive closure relations for the von K\'arm\'an Howarth and Corrsin equations, which coincide with those previously proposed by the author, thereby providing an independent theoretical validation of those closures.</description>

      <title>Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stems from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains a challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with different fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids, commonly known as `Boger fluids', made with polyisobutylene, to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a linear algebraic relation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of dilute viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</description>
