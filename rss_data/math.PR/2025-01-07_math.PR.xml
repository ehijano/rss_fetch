      <title>Existence of optimal controls for stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a stochastic optimal feedback control problem for the controlled stochastic partial differential equations. More precisely, we establish the existence of stochastic optimal feedback control for the controlled stochastic partial differential equations with fully monotone coefficients by a minimizing sequence for the control problem. Using the Faedo-Galerkin approximations, the uniform estimates and the tightness in some appropriate space for the Faedo-Galerkin approximating solution can be obtain to prove the well-posedness of the controlled stochastic partial differential equations with fully monotone coefficients. The results obtained in the present paper may be applied to various types of controlled stochastic partial differential equations, such as the controlled stochastic convection diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for globally perturbed random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\xi_1, \eta_1)$, $(\xi_2, \eta_2),\ldots$ be independent copies of an $\mathbb{R}^2$-valued random vector $(\xi, \eta)$ with arbitrarily dependent components. Put $T_n:= \xi_1+\ldots+\xi_{n-1} + \eta_n $ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and define $\tau(t) := \inf\{n\geq 1: T_n&gt;t\}$ the first passage time into $(t,\infty)$, $N(t) :=\sum_{n\geq 1}1_{\{T_n\leq t\}}$ the number of visits to $(-\infty, t]$ and $\rho(t):=\sup\{n\geq 1: T_n \leq t\}$ the associated last exit time for $t\in\mathbb{R}$. The standing assumption of the paper is $\mathbb{E}[\xi]\in (0,\infty)$. We prove a weak law of large numbers for $\tau(t)$ and strong laws of large numbers for $\tau(t)$, $N(t)$ and $\rho(t)$. The strong law of large numbers for $\tau(t)$ holds if, and only if, $\mathbb{E}[\eta^+]&lt;\infty$. In the complementary situation $\mathbb{E}[\eta^+]=\infty$ we prove functional limit theorems in the Skorokhod space for $(\tau(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, properly normalized without centering. Also, we provide sufficient conditions under which finite dimensional distributions of $(\tau(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, $(N(ut))_{u\geq 0}$ and $(\rho(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, properly normalized and centered, converge weakly as $t\to\infty$ to those of a Brownian motion. Quite unexpectedly, the centering needed for $(N(ut))$ takes in general a more complicated form than the centering $ut/\mathbb{E}[\xi]$ needed for $(\tau(ut))$ and $(\rho(ut))$. Finally, we prove a functional limit theorem in the Skorokhod space for $(N(ut))$ under optimal moment conditions.</description>

      <title>On a class of critical Markov branching processes with non-homogeneous Poisson immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies a class of critical Markov branching processes with infinite variance of the offspring distribution. The processes admit also an immigration component at the jump-points of a non-homogeneous Poisson process, assuming that the mean number of immigrants is infinite and the intensity of the Poisson process converges to a constant. The asymptotic behavior of the probability for non-visiting zero is obtained. Proper limit distributions are proved, under suitable normalization of the sample paths, depending on the offspring distribution and the distribution of the immigrants.</description>

      <title>On the jump of the cover time in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk of the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $n$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $r_c &lt; r \le (1-\varepsilon)r_g$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\varepsilon)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor).</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of generalized money exchange models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Money Exchange Model" is a type of agent-based simulation model used to study how wealth distribution and inequality evolve through monetary exchanges between individuals. The primary focus of this model is to identify the limiting wealth distributions that emerge at the macroscopic level, given the microscopic rules governing the exchanges among agents. In this paper, we formulate generalized versions of the immediate exchange model and the uniform saving model both of which are types of money exchange models, as discrete-time interacting particle systems and characterize their stationary distributions. Furthermore, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the asymptotic wealth distribution converges to a Gamma distribution or an exponential distribution for both models. The limiting distribution depends on the weight function that affects the probability distribution of the number of coins exchanged by each agent. In particular, our results provide a mathematically rigorous formulation and generalization of the assertions previously predicted in studies based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Upper and lower bounds on TVD and KLD between centered elliptical distributions in high-dimensional setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive some upper and lower bounds and inequalities for the total variation distance (TVD) and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), also known as the relative entropy, between two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ defined by $$
  D_{\mathrm{TV}} ( \mu, \nu ) = \sup_{B \in \mathcal{B} (\mathbb{R}^n)}
  \left| \mu(B) - \nu(B) \right|
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  D_{\mathrm{KL}} ( \mu \, \| \, \nu ) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
  \ln \left( \frac{d\mu(x)}{d\nu(x)} \right) \, \mu(dx) $$ correspondingly when the dimension $n$ is high. We begin with some elementary bounds for centered elliptical distributions admitting densities and showcase how these bounds may be used by estimating the TVD and KLD between multivariate Student and multivariate normal distribution in the high-dimensional setting. Next, we show how the same approach simplifies when we apply it to multivariate Gamma distributions with independent components (in the latter case, we only study the TVD, because KLD may be calculated explicitly, see [1]). Our approach is motivated by the recent contribution by Barabesi and Pratelli [2].</description>

Abstract: A point of a metric space is called a $k$-hub if it is the endpoint of exactly $k$ disjoint geodesics, and that the concatenation of any two of these paths is still a geodesic. We prove that in the Brownian sphere, there is no $k$-hub for $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The density of zeros of random power series with stationary complex Gaussian coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zeros of random power series with stationary complex Gaussian coefficients, whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous. We analyze the precise asymptotic behavior of the radial density of zeros near the boundary of the circle of convergence. The dependence of the coefficients generally reduces the density of zeros compared with that of the hyperbolic Gaussian analytic function (the i.i.d. coefficients case), where the spectral density and its zeros plays a crucial role in this reduction. We also show the relationship between the support of the spectral measure and the analytic continuation at the boundary of the circle of convergence.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic frames and Wasserstein distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Wasserstein distances to characterize and study probabilistic frames. Adapting results from Olkin and Pukelsheim, from Gelbrich and from Cuesta-Albertos, Matran-Bea and Tuero-Diaz to frame operators, we show that the sets of probabilistic frames with given frame operator are homeomorphic by an optimal linear push-forward. Using the Wasserstein distances, we generalize several recent results in probabilistic frame theory and show path connectedness of the set of probabilistic frames with a fixed frame operator. We also describe transport duals that do not arise as push-forwards and characterize those that are push-forwards.</description>

      <title>Constructing stochastic flows of kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we suggest a new construction of stochastic flows of kernels in a locally compact separable metric space $M$. Starting from a consistent sequence of Feller transtition function $(\mathsf{P}^{(n)}: n\geq 1)$ on $M$ we prove existence of a stochastic flow of kernels $K=(K_{s,t}: -\infty&lt;s\leq t&lt;\infty)$ in $M,$ such that distributions of $n$-point motions of $K$ are determined by $\mathsf{P}^{(n)}.$ Presented construction allows to find a single idempotent measurable presentation $\mathfrak{p}$ of distributions of all kernels $K_{s,t}$ from the flow, and to construct a flow that is invariant under $\mathfrak{p}$ and is jointly measurable in all arguments.</description>

      <title>On the components of random geometric graphs in the dense limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the geometric graph on $n$ independent uniform random points in a connected compact region $A$ of ${\bf R}^d, d \geq 2$ with smooth boundary, or in the unit square, with distance parameter $r_n$. Let $K_n$ be the number of components of this graph, and $R_n$ the number of vertices not in the giant component. Let $S_n$ be the number of isolated vertices. We show that if $r_n$ is chosen so that $nr_n^d$ tends to infinity but slowly enough that ${\bf E}[S_n]$ also tends to infinity, then $K_n$, $R_n$ and $S_n$ are all asymptotic to $\mu_n$ in probability as $n \to \infty$ where (with $|A|$, $\theta_d$ and $|\partial A|$ denoting the volume of $A$, the volume of the unit $d$-ball, and the perimeter of $A$ respectively) $\mu_n := ne^{-\pi n r_n^d/|A|}$ if $d=2$ and $\mu_n := ne^{-\theta_d n r_n^d/|A|} + \theta_{d-1}^{-1} |\partial A| r_n^{1-d} e^{- \theta_d n r_n^d/(2|A|)}$ if $d\geq 3$. We also give variance asymptotics and central limit theorems for $K_n$ and $R_n$ in this limiting regime when $d \geq 3$, and for Poisson input with $d \geq 2$. We extend these results (substituting ${\bf E}[S_n]$ for $\mu_n$) to a class of non-uniform distributions on $A$.</description>

      <title>A maximum principle for the Coulomb gas: microscopic density bounds, confinement estimates, and high temperature limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and prove a maximum principle for a natural quantity related to the $k$-point correlation function of the classical one-component Coulomb gas. As an application, we show that the gas is confined to the droplet by a well-known effective potential in dimensions two and higher. We also prove new upper bounds for the particle density in the droplet that apply at any temperature. In particular, we give the first controls on the microscopic point process for high temperature Coulomb gases beyond the mean-field regime, proving that their laws are uniformly tight in the particle number $N$ for any inverse temperatures $\beta_N$. Furthermore, we prove that limit points are homogeneous mixed Poisson point processes if $\beta_N\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus via Stopping Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a derivative-based development of core aspects of stochastic calculus. We define a notion of stopping derivative, which is a form of right derivative with respect to stopping times. Using this, we define the drift and variance rate of a process as stopping derivatives for conditional expectation and conditional variance respectively. We prove a version of It\^o's formula, expressing how the quantities of drift and variance rate transform under the application of a twice continuously differentiable function. Another result establishes a characterisation of continuous local martingales as continuous processes that have zero drift. We also give a fundamental theorem of calculus for stopping derivatives, which relates the stopping-derivative-defined drift and variance rate to the parameters used in the definition of a process via a stochastic integral.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gaussian free field $\varphi$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 3$ and study the level sets $\{\varphi \geq h \}$ in the percolating regime. We prove upper and lower bounds for the probability that the chemical distance is much larger than Euclidean distance.

      <title>Yamada-Watanabe uniqueness results for SPDEs driven by Wiener and pure jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yamada-Watanabe theory provides a robust framework for understanding stochastic equations driven by Wiener processes. Despite its comprehensive treatment in the literature, the applicability of the theory to SPDEs driven by Poisson random measures or, more generally, L\'evy processes remains significantly less explored, with only a handful of results addressing this context. In this work, we leverage a result by Kurtz to demonstrate that the existence of a martingale solution combined with pathwise uniqueness implies the existence of a unique strong solution for SPDEs driven by both a Wiener process and a Poisson random measure. Our discussion is set within the variational framework, where the SPDE under consideration may be nonlinear. This work is influenced by earlier research conducted by the second author alongside de Bouard and Ondrej\'at.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogenization of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with fast oscillation in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, and driven by multiplicative cylindrical Wiener noise. Using two-scale convergence and the martingale representative theory, we show the solutions of original equations converge to a solution of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible version with constant coefficients. The paper also includes a corrector result which improve the two-scale convergence in the weak sense to strong one in regularity space.</description>

      <title>Growth-fragmentations, Brownian cone excursions and SLE(6) explorations of a quantum disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present a growth-fragmentation process naturally embedded in a Brownian excursion from boundary to apex in a cone of angle $2\pi/3$. This growth-fragmentation process corresponds, via the so-called mating-of-trees encoding arXiv:1409.7055, to the quantum boundary length process associated with a branching $\mathrm{SLE}_6$ exploration of a $\gamma= \sqrt{8/3}$ quantum disc. However, our proof uses only Brownian motion techniques, and along the way we discover various properties of Brownian cone excursions and their connections with stable L\'evy processes. Assuming the mating of trees encoding, our results imply several fundamental properties of the ${\gamma}= \sqrt{8/3}$-quantum disc $\mathrm{SLE}_6$-exploration.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for multi-species moderately interacting particle systems up to Newtonian singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a class of multi-species aggregation-diffusion systems from stochastic interacting particle systems via relative entropy method with quantitative bounds. We show an algebraic $L^1$-convergence result using moderately interacting particle systems approximating attractive/repulsive singular potentials up to Newtonian/Coulomb singularities without additional cut-off on the particle level. The first step is to make use of the relative entropy between the joint distribution of the particle system and an approximated limiting aggregation-diffusion system. A crucial argument in the proof is to show convergence in probability by a stopping time argument. The second step is to obtain a quantitative convergence rate to the limiting aggregation-diffusion system from the approximated PDE system. This is shown by evaluating a combination of relative entropy and $L^2$-distance.</description>

      <title>Parking on the Random Recursive Tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parking process on the random recursive tree. We first prove that although the random recursive tree has a non-degenerate Benjamini--Schramm limit, the phase transition for the parking process appears at density $0$. We then identify the critical window for appearance of a positive flux of cars with high probability. In the case of binary car arrivals, this happens at density $ \log (n)^{-2+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the size of the tree. This is the first work that studies the parking process on trees with possibly large degree vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic study of tuples of random non-increasing integers is crucial for probabilistic models coming from asymptotic representation theory and statistical physics. We study the global behavior of such tuples, introducing a new family of discrete probability measures, depending on a parameter $q \in [- 1, 1]$. We prove the Law of Large Numbers for these measures based on the asymptotics of the Schur generating functions and we provide explicit formulas for the moments and the free cumulants of the limiting measures. Our results provide an interpolation between the results of Bufetov and Gorin for $q = 0, 1$, who distinguished these two cases from the side of free probability theory. We show the connection with free probability theory and we introduce a deformation of free convolution, motivated by our formulas for the free cumulants. We also study the first order correction to the Law of Large Numbers and we make the connection with infinitesimal free probability, computing explicitly the infinitesimal moments and the infinitesimal free cumulants. Finally, we prove non-asymptotic relations between the limiting measures for different $q$, which are related to the celebrated Markov-Krein correspondence.</description>

      <title>Statistical learning does not always entail knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study learning and knowledge acquisition (LKA) of an agent about a proposition that is either true or false. We use a Bayesian approach, where the agent receives data to update his beliefs about the proposition according to a posterior distribution. The LKA is formulated in terms of active information, with data representing external or exogenous information that modifies the agent's beliefs. It is assumed that data provide details about a number of features that are relevant to the proposition. We show that this leads to a Gibbs distribution posterior, which is in maximum entropy relative to the prior, conditioned on the side constraints that the data provide in terms of the features. We demonstrate that full learning is sometimes not possible and full knowledge acquisition is never possible when the number of extracted features is too small. We also distinguish between primary learning (receiving data about features of relevance for the proposition) and secondary learning (receiving data about the learning of another agent). We argue that this type of secondary learning does not represent true knowledge acquisition. Our results have implications for statistical learning algorithms, and we claim that such algorithms do not always generate true knowledge. The theory is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a non-associative analog to the well-known $\frac{5}{8}$ Theorem. Namely, for a finite Moufang loop with nuclear commutators, we show that if the probability that three randomly chosen elements associate is greater than $\frac{43}{64}$, then the loop must be a group. The bound is tight as demonstrated by the 16-element Octonion loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the second order asymptotic expansion for tail probabilities of discounted aggregate claims in continuous-time renewal risk models with constant interest force. Concretely, two types of continuous-time renewal risk models without and with by-claims are separately discussed. By constructing the asymptotic theory and weighted Kesten-type inequality of randomly weighted sums for second order subexponential random variables, second order asymptotic formulae for these two risk models are firstly built. In comparison of the first order asymptotic formulae, our results are more superior and precise, which are demonstrated by some simple numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Major-minor mean field games: common noise helps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to study the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibria in mean field games involving a major player and a continuum of minor players over finite intervals of arbitrary length. Following earlier articles addressing similar questions in the context of classical mean field games, the cost functions for the minor players are assumed to satisfy the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition. In this contribution, we demonstrate that if, in addition to the monotonicity condition, the intensity of the (Brownian) noise driving the major player is sufficiently high, then -- under further mild regularity assumptions on the coefficients -- existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibria are guaranteed. A key challenge is to show that the threshold (beyond which the noise intensity must be taken) can be chosen independently of the length of the time interval over which the game is defined. Building on the stability properties thus established, we further show that the associated system of master equations admits a unique classical solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind for major-minor mean field games defined over intervals of arbitrary length.</description>

      <title>A Large-dimensional Analysis of ESPRIT DoA Estimation: Inconsistency and a Correction via RMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform asymptotic analyses of the widely used ESPRIT direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimator for large arrays, where the array size $N$ and the number of snapshots $T$ grow to infinity at the same pace. In this large-dimensional regime, the sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to be a poor eigenspectral estimator of the population covariance. We show that the classical ESPRIT algorithm, that relies on the SCM, and as a consequence of the large-dimensional inconsistency of the SCM, produces inconsistent DoA estimates as $N,T \to \infty$ with $N/T \to c \in (0,\infty)$, for both widely- and closely-spaced DoAs. Leveraging tools from random matrix theory (RMT), we propose an improved G-ESPRIT method and prove its consistency in the same large-dimensional setting. From a technical perspective, we derive a novel bound on the eigenvalue differences between two potentially non-Hermitian random matrices, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Low-Rank Problems Using Semidefinite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-sample strategy for low-rank optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme, which obtains provably near-optimal solutions, mimicking the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and our sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although, both double-spending and selfish-mining attacks have been extensively studied since the ``Bitcoin'' whitepaper of Nakamoto and the ``majority is not enough'' paper of Eyal and Sirer, there has been no rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack that combines the two, except for the complicated MDP models. In this paper, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, there is a risk of double-spending which comes at no-cost to the adversary. The result can be seen as a guide for picking $k$ in the $k$-confirmation rule in a blockchain design. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the risk of double-spending is. We provide the minimum double-spend value needed for an attack to be profitable in the regimes where the scheme is less profitable than honest mining. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability. Finally, we evaluate the results and provide the optimal and the maximum stubbornness levels for each parameter regime as well as the revenue. As a case study, with Bitcoin's $k=6$ block confirmation rule, we evaluate the revenue and double-spending risk of the attacks for each pool parameter.</description>

      <title>On the Onsager-Machlup functional for the Brownian motion on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.09182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Onsager-Machlup functionals are used to describe the dynamics of a continuous stochastic process. For a stochastic process taking values in a Riemannian manifold, they have been studied extensively. We describe the Onsager-Machlup functional with respect to the sup norm for a hypoelliptic Brownian motion on a Heisenberg group. Unlike in the Riemannian case we do not rely on the tools from differential geometry such as comparison theorems or curvature bounds as these are not easily available in the sub-Riemannian setting. In addition, we study fine properties of trajectories of the hypoelliptic Brownian motion, including a new notion of horizontal continuous curves.</description>

      <title>Conformal invariance of double random currents I: identification of the limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers devoted to the proof of conformal invariance of the critical double random current model on the square lattice. More precisely, we show the convergence of loop ensembles obtained by taking the cluster boundaries in the sum of two independent currents with free and wired boundary conditions. The strategy is first to prove convergence of the associated height function to the continuum Gaussian free field, and then to characterize the scaling limit of the loop ensembles as certain local sets of this Gaussian Free Field. In this paper, we identify uniquely the possible subsequential limits of the loop ensembles. Combined with the second paper, this completes the proof of conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Mapping hydrodynamics for the facilitated exclusion and zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic limit for two degenerate lattice gases, the \emph{facilitated exclusion process} (FEP) and the \emph{facilitated zero-range process} (FZRP), both in the symmetric and the asymmetric case. For both processes, the hydrodynamic limit in the symmetric case takes the form of a diffusive Stefan problem, whereas the asymmetric case is characterized by a hyperbolic Stefan problem. Although the FZRP is attractive, a property that we extensively use to derive its hydrodynamic limits in both cases, the FEP is not. To derive the hydrodynamic limit for the latter, we exploit that of the zero-range process, together with a classical mapping between exclusion and zero-range processes, both at the microscopic and macroscopic level. Due to the degeneracy of both processes, the asymmetric case is a new result, but our work also provides a simpler proof than the one that was previously proposed for the FEP in the symmetric case in \cite{blondel2021stefan}.</description>

      <title>Singular SPDEs on Homogeneous Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to extend the scope of the theory of regularity structures in order to deal with a large class of singular SPDEs of the form $$\partial_t u = \mathfrak{L} u+ F(u, \xi)\ ,$$ where the differential operator $\mathfrak{L}$ fails to be elliptic. This is achieved by interpreting the base space $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ as a non-trivial homogeneous Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ such that the differential operator $\partial_t -\mathfrak{L}$ becomes a translation invariant hypoelliptic operator on $\mathbb{G}$. Prime examples are the kinetic Fokker-Planck operator $\partial_t -\Delta_v - v\cdot \nabla_x$ and heat-type operators associated to sub-Laplacians. As an application of the developed framework, we solve a class of parabolic Anderson type equations $$\partial_t u = \sum_{i} X^2_i u + u (\xi-c)$$ on the compact quotient of an arbitrary Carnot group.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of nonreversible Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the spectral gap of a Markov chain on a finite state space as the second-smallest singular value of the generator of the chain, generalizing the usual definition of spectral gap for reversible chains. We then define the relaxation time of the chain as the inverse of this spectral gap, and show that this relaxation time can be characterized, for any Markov chain, as the time required for convergence of empirical averages. This relaxation time is related to the Cheeger constant and the mixing time of the chain through inequalities that are similar to the reversible case, and the path argument can be used to get upper bounds. Several examples are worked out. An interesting finding from the examples is that the time for convergence of empirical averages in nonreversible chains can often be substantially smaller than the mixing time.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos in path spaces via information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems has been an active research topic over decades. We propose an alternative approach to study the mean-field limit of the stochastic interacting particle systems via tools from information theory. In our framework, the propagation of chaos is reduced to the space for driving processes with possible lower dimension. Indeed, after applying the data processing inequality, one only needs to estimate the difference between the drifts of the particle system and the mean-field Mckean stochastic differential equation. This point is particularly useful in situations where the discrepancy in the driving processes is more apparent than the investigated processes. We will take the second order system as well as other examples for the illustration of how our framework could be used. This approach allows us to focus on probability measures in path spaces for the driving processes, avoiding using the usual hypocoercivity technique or taking the pseudo-inverse of the diffusion matrix, which might be more stable for numerical computation. Our framework is different from current approaches in literature and could provide new insight into the study of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of non-local models with anomalous diffusions from stochastic particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a large class of nonlinear integro-differential scalar equations which involve an anomalous diffusion (e.g. driven by a fractional Laplacian) and a non-local singular convolution kernel. Each of those singular equations is obtained as the macroscopic limit of an interacting particle system modeled as N coupled stochastic differential equations driven by L\'evy processes. In particular we derive quantitative estimates between the microscopic empirical measure of the particle system and the solution to the limit equation in some non-homogeneous Sobolev space.
  Our result only requires very weak regularity on the interaction kernel, therefore it includes numerous applications, e.g.: the 2d turbulence model (including the quasi-geostrophic equation) in sub-critical regime, the 2d generalized Navier-Stokes equation, the fractional Keller-Segel equation in any dimension, and the fractal Burgers equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

      <title>Reflected backward stochastic differential equations with rough drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reflected backward stochastic differential equations driven by rough paths (rough RBSDEs), which can be viewed as probabilistic representations of nonlinear rough partial differential equations (rough PDEs) or stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with obstacles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions to rough RBSDEs solve the corresponding optimal stopping problems within a rough framework. This development provides effective and practical tools for pricing American options in the context of the rough volatility model, thus playing a crucial role in advancing the understanding and application of option pricing in complex market regimes.
  The well-posedness of rough RBSDEs is established using a variant of the Doss-Sussman transformation. Moreover, we show that rough RBSDEs can be approximated by a sequence of penalized BSDEs with rough drivers. For applications, we first develop the viscosity solution theory for rough PDEs with obstacles via rough RBSDEs. Second, we solve the corresponding optimal stopping problem and establish its connection with an American option pricing problem in the rough path setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider a large class of bullet models that contains, in particular, the colliding bullet model with creations and a new loop model. For this large class of bullet models, we give sufficient conditions on their parameter to be $\text{rot}(\pi)$-quasi-reversible and to be $\text{rot}(\pi/2)$-quasi-reversible. Moreover, those conditions assure them that one of their invariant measures is described by a Poisson Point Process. This result applied to the colliding bullet models with creations is a first step to study its property under its non-empty invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in hierarchical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) is a model of a directed metric and a zero-temperature polymer where the main observable is a directed path evolving in a random environment accruing as energy the sum of the random weights along itself. When the environment has light tails and a fast decay of correlation, the fluctuations of LPP are predicted to be explained by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality theory. However, the KPZ theory is not expected to apply for many natural environments, particularly "critical" ones exhibiting a hierarchical structure often leading to logarithmic correlations.
  In this article, we initiate a novel study of LPP in such hierarchical environments by investigating two particularly interesting examples. The first is an i.i.d. environment but with a power-law distribution with an inverse quadratic tail decay which is conjectured to be the critical point for the validity of the KPZ scaling relation. The second is the Branching Random Walk which is a hierarchical approximation of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field. The second example may be viewed as a high-temperature (weak coupling) directed version of Liouville Quantum Gravity, which is a model of random geometry driven by the exponential of a logarithmically-correlated field. Due to the underlying fractal structure, LPP in such environments is expected to exhibit logarithmic correction terms with novel critical exponents. While discussions about such critical models appear in the physics literature, precise predictions about exponents seem to be missing. Developing a framework based on multi-scale analysis, we obtain bounds on such exponents and prove almost optimal concentration results in all dimensions for both models. As a byproduct of our analysis we answer a long-standing question of Martin on necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear growth of the LPP energy in i.i.d. environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions at all times satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This gives a framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove convergence to the directed landscape for a range of models, some without exact solvability: asymmetric exclusion processes with potentially non-nearest neighbour interactions, exotic couplings of ASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distance, and directed polymer models. All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored ASEP and the KPZ equation, where we provide alternative proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the long-standing problem of elucidating the cutoff phenomenon for a vast and important class of Markov processes, namely Markov diffusions with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature. More precisely, we prove that any sequence of non-negatively curved diffusions exhibits cutoff in total variation as soon as the product condition is satisfied. Our result holds in Euclidean spaces as well as on Riemannian manifolds, and for arbitrary non-random initial conditions. It vastly simplifies, unifies and generalizes a number of isolated works that have established cutoff through a delicate and model-dependent analysis of mixing times. The proof is elementary: we exploit a new simple differential relation between varentropy and entropy to produce a quantitative bound on the width of the mixing window.</description>

      <title>Discrete stress-energy tensor in the loop O(n) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:1604.06339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the loop $O(n)$ model on the honeycomb lattice. By means of local non-planar deformations of the lattice, we construct a discrete stress-energy tensor. For $n\in [0,2]$, it gives a new observable satisfying a part of Cauchy-Riemann equations. We conjecture that it is approximately discrete-holomorphic and converges to the stress-energy tensor in the continuum, which is known to be a holomorphic function with the Schwarzian conformal covariance. In support of this conjecture, we prove it for the case of $n=1$ which corresponds to the Ising model. Moreover, in this case, we show that the correlations of the discrete stress-energy tensor with primary fields converge to their continuous counterparts, which satisfy the OPEs given by the CFT with central charge $c=1/2$.
  Proving the conjecture for other values of $n$ remains a challenge. In particular, this would open a road to establishing the convergence of the interface to the corresponding $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ in the scaling limit.</description>

Our results generalize and improve a recent theorem of T. Koga [J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 27 (2021), Article No. 18]. As an application, we give a quick Tauberian proof of Blackwell's renewal theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several basic problems about colouring the $p$-random subgraph $G_p$ of an arbitrary graph $G$, focusing primarily on the chromatic number and colouring number of $G_p$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many $k$-regular graphs $G$ for which the colouring number (i.e., degeneracy) of $G_{1/2}$ is at most $k/3 + o(k)$ with high probability, thus disproving the natural prediction that such random graphs must have colouring number at least $k/2 - o(k)$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic behavior near dynamical criticality of a facilitated conservative lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the critical relations and the scale separation.</description>

      <title>The 2D Toda lattice hierarchy for multiplicative statistics of Schur measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Fredholm determinants build out from generalizations of Schur measures, or equivalently, arbitrary multiplicative statistics of the original Schur measures are tau-functions of the 2D Toda lattice hierarchy. Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and the two-point function plateau for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain precise plateau estimates for the two-point function of the finite-volume weakly-coupled hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions $d \ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions, and for any number $n \ge 1$ of components of the field $\varphi$. We prove that, within a critical window around their respective effective critical points, the two-point functions for both free and periodic boundary conditions have a plateau, in the sense that they decay as $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ until reaching a constant plateau value of order $V^{-1/2}$ (with a logarithmic correction for $d=4$), where $V$ is size of the finite volume. The two critical windows for free and periodic boundary conditions do not overlap. The dependence of the plateau height on the location within the critical window is governed by an explicit $n$-dependent universal profile which is independent of the dimension. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalisation group method and extends the method used by Michta, Park and Slade (arXiv:2306.00896) to study the finite-volume susceptibility and related quantities. Our results lead to precise conjectures concerning Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models of spin systems and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d \ge 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally motivated by the morphogenesis of bacterial microcolonies, the aim of this article is to explore models through different scales for a spatial population of interacting, growing and dividing particles. We start from a microscopic stochastic model, write the corresponding stochastic differential equation satisfied by the empirical measure, and rigorously derive its mesoscopic (mean-field) limit. Under smoothness and symmetry assumptions for the interaction kernel, we then obtain entropy estimates, which provide us with a localization limit at the macroscopic level. Finally, we perform a thorough numerical study in order to compare the three modeling scales.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Green's Function and the Brown Measure of Atomic Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Brown measure the non-normal operators $X = p + i q$, where $p$ and $q$ are Hermitian, freely independent, and have spectra consisting of finitely many atoms. We use the Quaternionic Green's function, an analogue of the operator-valued $R$-transform in the physics literature, to understand the support and the boundary of the Brown measure of $X$. We present heuristics for the boundary and support of the Brown measure in terms of the Quaternionic Green's function and verify they are true in the cases when the Brown measure of $X$ has been explicitly computed. In the general case, we show that the heuristic implies that the boundary of the Brown measure of $X$ is an algebraic curve, and provide an algorithm producing a polynomial defining this curve.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence of the discrete Makeenko-Migdal equations for the Yang-Mills model on $(\varepsilon \mathbf{Z})^{2}$ to their continuum counterparts on the plane, in an appropriate sense. The key step in the proof is identifying the limits of the contributions from deformations as the area derivatives of the Wilson loop expectations.</description>

      <title>Residual connections provably mitigate oversmoothing in graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>
