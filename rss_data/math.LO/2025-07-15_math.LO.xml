      <title>Complexity of the variable-free fragments of non-normal modal logics (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the satisfiability problem for the variable-free fragment of every modal logic containing classical propositional logic and contained in the weak Grzegorczyk logic is NP-hard. In particular, the variable-free fragments of the non-normal modal logics E, EM, EN, and EMN are coNP-complete.</description>

      <title>Definable coordinate geometries over fields, part 1: theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define general notions of coordinate geometries over fields and ordered fields, and consider coordinate geometries that are given by finitely many relations that are definable over those fields. We show that the automorphism group of such a geometry determines the geometry up to definitional equivalence; moreover, if we are given two such geometries $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$, then the concepts (explicitly definable relations) of $\mathcal{G}$ are concepts of $\mathcal{G}'$ exactly if the automorphisms of $\mathcal{G}'$ are automorphisms of $\mathcal{G}$. We show this by first proving that a relation is a concept of $\mathcal{G}$ exactly if it is closed under the automorphisms of $\mathcal{G}$ and is definable over the field; moreover, it is enough to consider automorphisms that are affine transformations.</description>

      <title>Definable coordinate geometries over fields, part 2: applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part 1 of this study we showed, for a wide range of geometries, that the relationships between their concept-sets are fully determined by those between their (affine) automorphism groups. In this (self-contained) part, we show how this result can be applied to quickly determine relationships and differences between various geometries and spacetimes, including ordered affine, Euclidean, Galilean, Newtonian, Late Classical, Relativistic and Minkowski spacetimes (we first define these spacetimes and geometries using a Tarskian first-order language centred on the ternary relation $\mathsf{Bw}$ of betweenness). We conclude with a selection of open problems related to the existence of certain intermediate geometries.</description>

      <title>The Network Satisfaction Problem for Relation Algebras with at most 4 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andr\'eka and Maddux classified the relation algebras with at most 3 atoms, and in particular they showed that all of them are representable. Hirsch and Cristiani showed that the network satisfaction problem (NSP) for each of these algebras is in P or NP-hard. There are relation algebras with 4 atoms that are not representable, and there are many results in the literature about representations and non-representability of relation algebras with at most 4 atoms. We extend the result of Hirsch and Cristiani to relation algebras with at most 4 atoms: the NSP is always either in P or NP-hard. To this end, we construct universal, fully universal, or even normal representations for these algebras, whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Justification Logic for Intuitionistic Modal Logic (Extended Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Justification logics are an explication of modal logic; boxes are replaced with proof terms formally through realisation theorems. This can be achieved syntactically using a cut-free proof system e.g. using sequent, hypersequent or nested sequent calculi. In constructive modal logic, boxes and diamonds are decoupled and not De Morgan dual. Kuznets, Marin and Stra{\ss}burger provide a justification counterpart to constructive modal logic CK and some extensions by making diamonds explicit by introducing new terms called satisfiers. We continue the line of work to provide a justification counterpart to Fischer Servi's intuitionistic modal logic IK and its extensions with the t and 4 axioms. We: extend the syntax of proof terms to accommodate the additional axioms of intuitionistic modal logic; provide an axiomatisation of these justification logics; provide a syntactic realisation procedure using a cut-free nested sequent system for intuitionistic modal logic introduced by Stra{\ss}burger.</description>

      <title>A proof-theoretic metatheorem for nonlinear semigroups generated by an accretive operator and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We further develop the theoretical framework of proof mining, a program in mathematical logic that seeks to quantify and extract computational information from prima facie `non-computational' proofs from the mainstream mathematical literature. To that end, we establish logical metatheorems that allow for the treatment of proofs involving nonlinear semigroups generated by an accretive operator, structures which in particular arise in the study of the solutions and asymptotic behavior of differential equations. In that way, the here established metatheorems facilitate a theoretical basis for the application of methods from the proof mining program to the wide variety of mathematical results established in the context of that theory since the 1970's. We in particular illustrate the applicability of the new systems and their metatheorems introduced here by providing two case studies on two central results due to Reich and Plant, respectively, on the asymptotic behavior of said semigroups and the resolvents of their generators where we derive rates of convergence for the limits involved which are, moreover, polynomial in all data.</description>

      <title>Semisimple groups interpretable in various valued fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite groups interpretable in power bounded $T$-convex, $V$-minimal or $p$-adically closed fields. We show that if $G$ is an interpretable definably semisimple group (i.e., has no definable infinite normal abelian subgroups) then, up to a finite index subgroup, it is definably isogenous to a group $G_1\times G_2$, where $G_1$ is a $K$-linear group and $G_2$ is a $\mathbf{k}$-linear group. The analysis is carried out by studying the interaction of $G$ with four distinguished sorts: the valued field $K$, the residue field $\mathbf{k}$, the value group $\Gamma$, and the closed $0$-balls $K/\mathcal{O}$.</description>

Abstract: A normal modal logic is pretransitive, if the modality corresponding to the transitive closure of an accessibility relation is expressible in it. In the present work we establish the finite model property for pretransitive generalizations of K4, wK4, GL, and their extensions by canonical subframe-hereditary formulas.</description>

      <title>On the universal theory of the free pseudocomplemented distributive lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the universal theory of the free pseudocomplemented distributive lattice is decidable and a recursive axiomatization is presented. This contrasts with the case of the full elementary theory of the finitely generated free algebras which is known to be undecidable. As a by-product, a description of the finitely generated pseudocomplemented distributive lattices that can be embedded into the free algebra is also obtained.</description>

We also prove that the minimum (random) $k$ such that two independent random graphs are distinguishable by a first order sentence with $k$ variables belongs to $\{h,h+1,h+2\}$ with probability $1-o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Induction and Recursion Principles in a Higher-Order Quantitative Logic for Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative logic reasons about the degree to which formulas are satisfied. This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes.
  We construct an affine calculus for $1$-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers.
  We illustrate the expressivity of the logic by a sequence of case studies: Proving upper limits on bisimilarity distances of Markov processes, showing convergence of a temporal learning algorithm and of a random walk using a coupling argument. Finally we show how to encode a probabilistic Hoare logic in our logic.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

      <title>A Sequent Calculus Perspective on Base-Extension Semantics (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define base-extension semantics (Bes) using atomic systems based on sequent calculus rather than natural deduction. While traditional Bes aligns naturally with intuitionistic logic due to its constructive foundations, we show that sequent calculi with multiple conclusions yield a Bes framework more suited to classical semantics. The harmony in classical sequents leads to straightforward semantic clauses derived solely from right introduction rules. This framework enables a Sandqvist-style completeness proof that extracts a sequent calculus proof from any valid semantic consequence. Moreover, we show that the inclusion or omission of atomic cut rules meaningfully affects the semantics, yet completeness holds in both cases.</description>

      <title>Generalised ultracategories and conceptual completeness of geometric logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of generalised ultracategories, these are relational extensions to ultracategories as defined by Lurie. An essential example of generalised ultracategories are topological spaces, and these play a fundamental role in the theory of generalised ultracategories. Another example of these generalised ultracategories is points of toposes. In this paper, we show a conceptual completeness theorem for toposes with enough points, stating that any such topos can be reconstructed from its generalised ultracategory of points. This is done by considering left ultrafunctors from topological spaces to the category of points and paralleling this construction with another known fundamental result in topos theory, namely that any topos with enough points is a colimit of a topological groupoid.</description>
