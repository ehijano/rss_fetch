      <title>Pseudo-holomorphic triangles and the median quasi-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the minimal area of a holomorphic triangle whose boundary lies on the union of any three Lagrangian submanifolds is bounded from above by the Lagrangian spectral norm of any pair taken out of the three. We show a relation between this result and the median quasi-state on the 2-sphere. The median quasi-state gives rise to a measure of Poisson non-commutativity of any pair of functions. We answer a question of Entov--Polterovich--Zapolsky by giving a sharp upper bound on the ratio between this measure and the uniform norm of the Poisson bracket of the pair. The sharpness of this bound also implies a lower bound on the defect of the Calabi quasi-morphism.</description>

      <title>Conformally symplectic structures and the Lefschetz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note provides a symplectic analogue of Vaisman's theorem in complex geometry. Namely, for any compact symplectic manifold satisfying the hard Lefschetz condition in degree 1, every locally conformally symplectic structure is in fact globally conformally symplectic, whenever there is a mutually compatible almost complex structure.</description>

      <title>Geodesic vector fields, induced contact structures and tightness in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide new and simpler proofs of two theorems of Gluck and Harrison on contact structures induced by great circle or line fibrations. Furthermore, we prove that a geodesic vector field whose Jacobi tensor is parallel along flow lines (e.g. if the underlying manifold is locally symmetric) induces a contact structure if the 'mixed' sectional curvatures are nonnegative, and if a certain nondegeneracy condition holds. Additionally, we prove that in dimension three, contact structures admitting a Reeb flow which is either periodic, isometric, or free and proper, must be universally tight. In particular, we generalise an earlier result of Geiges and the author, by showing that every contact form on $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose Reeb vector field spans a line fibration is necessarily tight. Furthermore, we provide a characterisation of isometric Reeb vector fields. As an application, we recover a result of Kegel and Lange on Seifert fibrations spanned by Reeb vector fields, and we classify closed contact $3$-manifolds with isometric Reeb flows (also known as $R$-contact manifolds) up to diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Legendrian loops and cluster modular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies Legendrian loop actions on exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian links in $(\R^3, \xi_{\st})$. By identifying the induced action of Legendrian loops as generators of cluster modular groups, we establish the existence of faithful group actions on the exact Lagrangian fillings of several families of Legendrian positive braid closures, including all positive torus links. In addition, we leverage a Nielsen-Thurston-like classification of cluster automorphisms to provide new combinatorial and algebraic tools for proving that a Legendrian loop action has infinite order.</description>

      <title>On categorification of Stokes coefficients in Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-dimensional oscillatory integral which provides a "finite-dimensional model" for analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory on closed 3-manifolds that are described by plumbing trees. This model allows an efficient description of Stokes phenomenon for perturbative expansions in Chern-Simons theory around classical solutions - $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connections. Moreover, the Stokes coefficients can be categorified, i.e. promoted to graded vector spaces, in terms of this finite-dimensional model. At least naively, the categorification gives BPS spectrum of 5d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the 3-manifold times a line with appropriate boundary conditions. We also comment on necessity of taking into account "flat connections at infinity" to capture Stokes phenomenon for certain 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Stein fillings vs. Milnor fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a link of a normal surface singularity with its canonical contact structure, we compare the collection of its Stein fillings to its Milnor fillings (that is, Milnor fibers of possible smoothings). We prove that, unlike Stein fillings, Milnor fillings of a given link have bounded topology; for links of sandwiched singularities, we further establish that there are only finitely many Milnor fillings. We discuss some other obstructions for a Stein filling to be represented by a Milnor fiber, and for various types of singularities, including simple classes like cusps and triangle singularities, we produce Stein fillings that do not come from Milnor fibers or resolutions. Meanwhile, we discover that there are many contact 3-manifolds that admit infinitely many Stein fillings but do not admit arbitrarily large ones.</description>

      <title>Some Examples of Family Floer Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.07079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give explicit calculations for the family Floer mirrors of some non-compact Calabi-Yau surfaces. We compare it with the mirror construction of Gross-Hacking-Keel for suitably chosen log Calabi-Yau pairs and the rank two cluster varieties of finite type. In particular, the analytifications of the later two give partial compactifications of the family Floer mirrors that we computed.</description>

      <title>On Donaldson's 4-6 question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the examples by Smith and McMullen-Taubes provide infinitely many counterexamples to one direction of Donaldson's 4-6 question and the closely related Stabilising Conjecture. These are the first known counterexamples. In the other direction, we show that the Gromov-Witten invariants of two simply-connected closed symplectic $4$-manifolds, whose products with $(S^2,\omega_{\text{std}})$ are deformation equivalent, agree. In particular, when $b_2^+ \geq 2$, these $4$-manifolds have the same Seiberg-Witten invariants. Furthermore, one can replace $(S^2,\omega_{\text{std}})$ by $(S^2,\omega_{\text{std}})^k$ for any $k \geq 1$ in both results.</description>
