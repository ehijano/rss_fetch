      <title>Parameter estimation of epidemic spread in two-layer random graphs by classical and machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main goal in this paper is to quantitatively compare the performance of classical methods to XGBoost and convolutional neural networks in a parameter estimation problem for epidemic spread. As we use flexible two-layer random graphs as the underlying network, we can also study how much the structure of the graphs in the training set and the test set can differ while to get a reasonably good estimate. In addition, we also examine whether additional information (such as the average degree of infected vertices) can help improving the results, compared to the case when we only know the time series consisting of the number of susceptible and infected individuals. Our simulation results also show which methods are most accurate in the different phases of the epidemic.</description>

      <title>Support and Scandals in GameFi dApps: A Network Analysis of The Sandbox Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the burgeoning field of GameFi through a detailed network analysis of The Sandbox, a prominent decentralized application (dApp) in this domain. Utilizing the bow-tie model, we map out transaction data within The Sandbox, providing a novel perspective on its operational dynamics. Our study investigates the varying impacts of external support, uncovering a surprising absence of enduring effects on network activity. We also investigate the network's response to several notable incidents, including the Ronin Hack and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's hearing on cryptocurrencies, revealing a generally resilient structure with limited long-term disturbances. A critical aspect of our analysis focuses on the "whales," or major stakeholders in The Sandbox, where we uncover their pivotal role in influencing network trends, noting a significant shift in their engagement over time. This research sheds light on the intricate workings of GameFi ecosystems and contributes to the broader discourse on the intersection of the Web, AI, and society, particularly in understanding the resilience and dynamics of emerging digital economies. We particularly note the parallels of the long-tail behavior we see in web-based ecosystems appearing in this niche domain of GameFi. Our findings hold significant implications for the future development of equitable and sustainable GameFi dApps, offering insights into stakeholder behavior and network resilience in the face of external challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Interaction Equation: Quantifying the Effect of User Interactions on Social Media Homepage Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms depend on algorithms to select, curate, and deliver content personalized for their users. These algorithms leverage users' past interactions and extensive content libraries to retrieve and rank content that personalizes experiences and boosts engagement. Among various modalities through which this algorithmically curated content may be delivered, the homepage feed is the most prominent. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how prior user interactions influence the content presented on users' homepage feeds across three major platforms: YouTube, Reddit, and X (formerly Twitter). We use a series of carefully designed experiments to gather data capable of uncovering the influence of specific user interactions on homepage content. This study provides insights into the behaviors of the content curation algorithms used by each platform, how they respond to user interactions, and also uncovers evidence of deprioritization of specific topics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of connectivity and electronic components in vehicles makes these systems valuable targets for attackers. While automotive vendors prioritize safety, there remains a critical need for comprehensive assessment and analysis of cyber risks. In this context, this paper proposes a Social Media Automotive Threat Intelligence (SOCMATI) framework, specifically designed for the emerging field of automotive cybersecurity. The framework leverages advanced intelligence techniques and machine learning models to extract valuable insights from social media. Four use cases illustrate the framework's potential by demonstrating how it can significantly enhance threat assessment procedures within the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Modularity aided consistent attributed graph clustering via coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique for partitioning graphs with attributes and detecting communities. However, current methods struggle to accurately capture true community structures and intra-cluster relations, be computationally efficient, and identify smaller communities. We address these challenges by integrating coarsening and modularity maximization, effectively leveraging both adjacency and node features to enhance clustering accuracy. We propose a loss function incorporating log-determinant, smoothness, and modularity components using a block majorization-minimization technique, resulting in superior clustering outcomes. The method is theoretically consistent under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM), ensuring asymptotic error-free performance and complete label recovery. Our provably convergent and time-efficient algorithm seamlessly integrates with graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to learn enhanced node features and deliver exceptional clustering performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods for both attributed and non-attributed graphs.</description>

      <title>Finding Fake News Websites in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The battle against the spread of misinformation on the Internet is a daunting task faced by modern society. Fake news content is primarily distributed through digital platforms, with websites dedicated to producing and disseminating such content playing a pivotal role in this complex ecosystem. Therefore, these websites are of great interest to misinformation researchers. However, obtaining a comprehensive list of websites labeled as producers and/or spreaders of misinformation can be challenging, particularly in developing countries. In this study, we propose a novel methodology for identifying websites responsible for creating and disseminating misinformation content, which are closely linked to users who share confirmed instances of fake news on social media. We validate our approach on Twitter by examining various execution modes and contexts. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in identifying misinformation websites, which can aid in gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon and enabling competent entities to tackle the problem in various areas of society.</description>

      <title>Deep-Graph-Sprints: Accelerated Representation Learning in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are essential for modeling interconnected, evolving systems. Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</description>

      <title>Higher-order null models as a lens for social systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of higher-order mathematical structures such as hypergraphs, methodological tools for their analysis lag behind those for traditional graphs. This work addresses a critical gap in this context by proposing two micro-canonical random null models for directed hypergraphs: the Directed Hypergraph Configuration Model (DHCM) and the Directed Hypergraph JOINT Model (DHJM). These models preserve essential structural properties of directed hypergraphs such as node in- and out-degree sequences and hyperedge head and tail size sequences, or their joint tensor. We also describe two efficient MCMC algorithms, NuDHy-Degs and NuDHy-JOINT, to sample random hypergraphs from these ensembles.
  To showcase the interdisciplinary applicability of the proposed null models, we present three distinct use cases in sociology, epidemiology, and economics. First, we reveal the oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the US Congress over a 40-year span, emphasizing the role of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily. Second, we investigate non-linear contagion in contact hyper-networks, demonstrating that disparities between simulations and theoretical predictions can be explained by considering higher-order joint degree distributions. Last, we examine the economic complexity of countries in the global trade network, showing that local network properties preserved by NuDHy explain the main structural economic complexity indexes.
  This work advances the development of null models for directed hypergraphs, addressing the intricate challenges posed by their complex entity relations, and providing a versatile suite of tools for researchers across various domains.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
