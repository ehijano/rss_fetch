      <title>Cut the Crap: An Economical Communication Pipeline for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-powered agents have shown that collective intelligence can significantly outperform individual capabilities, largely attributed to the meticulously designed inter-agent communication topologies. Though impressive in performance, existing multi-agent pipelines inherently introduce substantial token overhead, as well as increased economic costs, which pose challenges for their large-scale deployments. In response to this challenge, we propose an economical, simple, and robust multi-agent communication framework, termed $\texttt{AgentPrune}$, which can seamlessly integrate into mainstream multi-agent systems and prunes redundant or even malicious communication messages. Technically, $\texttt{AgentPrune}$ is the first to identify and formally define the \textit{communication redundancy} issue present in current LLM-based multi-agent pipelines, and efficiently performs one-shot pruning on the spatial-temporal message-passing graph, yielding a token-economic and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{AgentPrune}$ \textbf{(I)} achieves comparable results as state-of-the-art topologies at merely $\$5.6$ cost compared to their $\$43.7$, \textbf{(II)} integrates seamlessly into existing multi-agent frameworks with $28.1\%\sim72.8\%\downarrow$ token reduction, and \textbf{(III)} successfully defend against two types of agent-based adversarial attacks with $3.5\%\sim10.8\%\uparrow$ performance boost.</description>

      <title>Learning Emergence of Interaction Patterns across Independent RL Agents in Multi-Agent Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world problems, such as controlling swarms of drones and urban traffic, naturally lend themselves to modeling as multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, existing multi-agent RL methods often suffer from scalability challenges, primarily due to the introduction of communication among agents. Consequently, a key challenge lies in adapting the success of deep learning in single-agent RL to the multi-agent setting. In response to this challenge, we propose an approach that fundamentally reimagines multi-agent environments. Unlike conventional methods that model each agent individually with separate networks, our approach, the Bottom Up Network (BUN), adopts a unique perspective. BUN treats the collective of multi-agents as a unified entity while employing a specialized weight initialization strategy that promotes independent learning. Furthermore, we dynamically establish connections among agents using gradient information, enabling coordination when necessary while maintaining these connections as limited and sparse to effectively manage the computational budget. Our extensive empirical evaluations across a variety of cooperative multi-agent scenarios, including tasks such as cooperative navigation and traffic control, consistently demonstrate BUN's superiority over baseline methods with substantially reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>ComaDICE: Offline Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Stationary Distribution Shift Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to learn effective policies from pre-collected datasets without the need for further environmental interactions. While promising results have been demonstrated in single-agent settings, offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) presents additional challenges due to the large joint state-action space and the complexity of multi-agent behaviors. A key issue in offline RL is the distributional shift, which arises when the target policy being optimized deviates from the behavior policy that generated the data. This problem is exacerbated in MARL due to the interdependence between agents' local policies and the expansive joint state-action space. Prior approaches have primarily addressed this challenge by incorporating regularization in the space of either Q-functions or policies. In this work, we introduce a regularizer in the space of stationary distributions to better handle distributional shift. Our algorithm, ComaDICE, offers a principled framework for offline cooperative MARL by incorporating stationary distribution regularization for the global learning policy, complemented by a carefully structured multi-agent value decomposition strategy to facilitate multi-agent training. Through extensive experiments on the multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft II benchmarks, we demonstrate that ComaDICE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art offline MARL methods across nearly all tasks.</description>

      <title>Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within these systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task is effectively resolved, leading to satisfactory responses to the original queries. These principles further inspire us to propose a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. During the planning process, the meta-agent is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the expert agents, making timely adjustments to the sub-tasks and scheduling as necessary. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into the proposed framework to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of the proposed framework in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>SwarmCVT: Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation-Based Path Planning for Very-Large-Scale Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robotics, or very large-scale robotics (VLSR), has many meaningful applications for complicated tasks. However, the complexity of motion control and energy costs stack up quickly as the number of robots increases. In addressing this problem, our previous studies have formulated various methods employing macroscopic and microscopic approaches. These methods enable microscopic robots to adhere to a reference Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distribution observed at the macroscopic scale. As a result, optimizing the macroscopic level will result in an optimal overall result. However, all these methods require systematic and global generation of Gaussian components (GCs) within obstacle-free areas to construct the GMM trajectories. This work utilizes centroidal Voronoi tessellation to generate GCs methodically. Consequently, it demonstrates performance improvement while also ensuring consistency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Choices are More Important than Efforts: LLM Enables Efficient Multi-Agent Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With expansive state-action spaces, efficient multi-agent exploration remains a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning. Although pursuing novelty, diversity, or uncertainty attracts increasing attention, redundant efforts brought by exploration without proper guidance choices poses a practical issue for the community. This paper introduces a systematic approach, termed LEMAE, choosing to channel informative task-relevant guidance from a knowledgeable Large Language Model (LLM) for Efficient Multi-Agent Exploration. Specifically, we ground linguistic knowledge from LLM into symbolic key states, that are critical for task fulfillment, in a discriminative manner at low LLM inference costs. To unleash the power of key states, we design Subspace-based Hindsight Intrinsic Reward (SHIR) to guide agents toward key states by increasing reward density. Additionally, we build the Key State Memory Tree (KSMT) to track transitions between key states in a specific task for organized exploration. Benefiting from diminishing redundant explorations, LEMAE outperforms existing SOTA approaches on the challenging benchmarks (e.g., SMAC and MPE) by a large margin, achieving a 10x acceleration in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Agents' Room: Narrative Generation through Multi-step Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing compelling fiction is a multifaceted process combining elements such as crafting a plot, developing interesting characters, and using evocative language. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for story writing, they currently rely heavily on intricate prompting, which limits their use. We propose Agents' Room, a generation framework inspired by narrative theory, that decomposes narrative writing into subtasks tackled by specialized agents. To illustrate our method, we introduce Tell Me A Story, a high-quality dataset of complex writing prompts and human-written stories, and a novel evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing long narratives. We show that Agents' Room generates stories that are preferred by expert evaluators over those produced by baseline systems by leveraging collaboration and specialization to decompose the complex story writing task into tractable components. We provide extensive analysis with automated and human-based metrics of the generated output.</description>

      <title>Grounded Answers for Multi-agent Decision-making Problem through Generative World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative models has stimulated significant innovations in many fields, such as image generation and chatbots. Despite their success, these models often produce sketchy and misleading solutions for complex multi-agent decision-making problems because they miss the trial-and-error experience and reasoning as humans. To address this limitation, we explore a paradigm that integrates a language-guided simulator into the multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline to enhance the generated answer. The simulator is a world model that separately learns dynamics and reward, where the dynamics model comprises an image tokenizer as well as a causal transformer to generate interaction transitions autoregressively, and the reward model is a bidirectional transformer learned by maximizing the likelihood of trajectories in the expert demonstrations under language guidance. Given an image of the current state and the task description, we use the world model to train the joint policy and produce the image sequence as the answer by running the converged policy on the dynamics model. The empirical results demonstrate that this framework can improve the answers for multi-agent decision-making problems by showing superior performance on the training and unseen tasks of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark. In particular, it can generate consistent interaction sequences and explainable reward functions at interaction states, opening the path for training generative models of the future.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Correlated Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate multi-agent imitation learning (IL) within the framework of mean field games (MFGs), considering the presence of time-varying correlated signals. Existing MFG IL algorithms assume demonstrations are sampled from Mean Field Nash Equilibria (MFNE), limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios. For example, in the traffic network equilibrium influenced by public routing recommendations, recommendations introduce time-varying correlated signals into the game, not captured by MFNE and other existing correlated equilibrium concepts. To address this gap, we propose Adaptive Mean Field Correlated Equilibrium (AMFCE), a general equilibrium incorporating time-varying correlated signals. We establish the existence of AMFCE under mild conditions and prove that MFNE is a subclass of AMFCE. We further propose Correlated Mean Field Imitation Learning (CMFIL), a novel IL framework designed to recover the AMFCE, accompanied by a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the recovered policy. Experimental results, including a real-world traffic flow prediction problem, demonstrate the superiority of CMFIL over state-of-the-art IL baselines, highlighting the potential of CMFIL in understanding large population behavior under correlated signals.</description>

      <title>CMP: Cooperative Motion Prediction with Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confluence of the advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the maturity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has enabled the capability of cooperative connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 16.4\% with fewer missing detections compared with the no cooperation setting and by 12.3\% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios.

      <title>Securing Equal Share: A Principled Approach for Learning Multiplayer Symmetric Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines multiplayer symmetric constant-sum games with more than two players in a competitive setting, including examples like Mahjong, Poker, and various board and video games. In contrast to two-player zero-sum games, equilibria in multiplayer games are neither unique nor non-exploitable, failing to provide meaningful guarantees when competing against opponents who play different equilibria or non-equilibrium strategies. This gives rise to a series of long-lasting fundamental questions in multiplayer games regarding suitable objectives, solution concepts, and principled algorithms. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing these challenges by focusing on the natural objective of equal share -- securing an expected payoff of C/n in an n-player symmetric game with a total payoff of C. We rigorously identify the theoretical conditions under which achieving an equal share is tractable and design a series of efficient algorithms, inspired by no-regret learning, that provably attain approximate equal share across various settings. Furthermore, we provide complementary lower bounds that justify the sharpness of our theoretical results. Our experimental results highlight worst-case scenarios where meta-algorithms from prior state-of-the-art systems for multiplayer games fail to secure an equal share, while our algorithm succeeds, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>
