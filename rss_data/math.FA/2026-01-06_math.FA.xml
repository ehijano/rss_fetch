      <title>Pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces with Shubin-type symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces. The gyrator transform is a two-dimensional linear canonical transform which can be viewed as a rotation in the time-frequency plane and is closely related to the fractional Fourier transform. Motivated by the global structure of the gyrator kernel, we work with Shubin global symbol classes on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We first recall basic properties of modulation spaces and establish continuity and invertibility of the gyrator transform on these spaces, using its representation as a metaplectic operator. Then we introduce pseudo-differential operators defined via the gyrator transform and a Shubin symbol, and we prove boundedness results on modulation spaces and on gyrator-based modulation-Sobolev spaces. Our work extends and generalises earlier results of Mahato, Arya and Prasad on Schwartz and Sobolev spaces \cite{MahatoGyrator} to the more flexible framework of modulation spaces.</description>

      <title>SG-Hankel Pseudo-Differential Operators on Weighted Gelfand-Shilov Type Spaces and a Numerical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of SG pseudo-differential operators associated with the Hankel transform on a family of weighted Gelfand--Shilov type spaces of radial functions. First, we recall basic properties of the Hankel transform of order $\nu&gt;-1/2$ and define a convenient Gelfand--Shilov type space $W_{\alpha,\beta}$ which is invariant under the Hankel transform and stable under differentiation and multiplication by powers of the radial variable. Then we define the SG--Hankel symbol class $S^{m_1,m_2}_H$ and the corresponding pseudo-differential operator \[ (T_\sigma f)(x)=\int_0^\infty \sigma(x,\lambda)J_\nu(x\lambda)\widehat f_H(\lambda)\,\lambda\,d\lambda. \] We prove that $T_\sigma$ is continuous on $W_{\alpha,\beta}$, and under additional decay assumptions on the symbol, we obtain compactness results between different weighted spaces. Minimal and maximal realisations of $T_\sigma$ in $L^2((0,\infty),x\, dx)$ are studied in detail, and a weak solvability result for the SG--Hankel pseudo-differential equation $T_\sigma f=g$ is derived. Finally, we present a numerical example for a simple SG symbol and a Gaussian input, illustrating the spatial decay predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Study of Composition Operators in Certain Functional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00801v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we study three problems. The first is the superposition of the operators and their proprities, such as boundedness,continuity,regularity and the inequalities of the norms of the composition of functions in some functional spaces. The second is to generalize some results of the composition of more than two functions, and the third is to give a generalization of Peetre's theorem.</description>

      <title>Defect Cocycles and the Structure of Finite Process Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive subunital maps on ordered effect spaces and introduce the defect $d(T) = u - T(u)$, which satisfies a cocycle identity under composition. Using only this identity and elementary order-theoretic arguments -- requiring no spectral decomposition or dimension-dependent techniques -- we prove that in any finite composition-closed family of positive subunital maps, defects are eventually annihilated under iteration (Theorem 4.1), with an explicit bound linear in the family size. Under a persistence hypothesis (nonzero positive elements map to nonzero positive elements), we establish that all maps in such families must be unital. For completely positive maps on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, we then prove a sharp dimension-dependent bound: the stabilization index satisfies $n_T \le d$ where $d$ is the Hilbert space dimension, independent of the family size. This bound is achieved by a shift channel construction. These results provide a structural explanation for why finite operational repertoires in process theories cannot sustain systematic information loss, with applications to quantum foundations and categorical probability.</description>

      <title>Maximal inequalities, frames and greedy algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to use Banach lattice techniques to study coordinate systems in function spaces. We begin by proving that the greedy algorithm of a basis is order convergent if and only if a certain maximal inequality is satisfied. We then show that absolute frames need not admit a reconstruction algorithm with respect to the usual order convergence, but do allow for reconstruction with respect to the order convergence inherited from the double dual. After this, we investigate the extent to which such coordinate systems affect the geometry of the underlying function space. Most notably, we prove that a Banach lattice $X$ is lattice isomorphic to a closed sublattice of a $C(K)$-space if and only if every unconditional sequence in $X$ is absolute.</description>

      <title>On phase and norm retrieval by subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies phase and norm retrieval by subspaces. We first investigate norm retrieval by hyperplanes. We show that if $N$ hyperplanes $\{\varphi_i^\perp\}_{i=1}^N\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ allow norm retrieval and the vectors $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^N$ are linearly independent, then these vectors must be an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^N$. We then present several new properties of subspaces that allow phase and norm retrieval. In particular, we provide a complete classification of two proper subspaces that perform norm retrieval. It is known that the collection of norm-retrievable frames $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^M$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is not dense in the set of all $M$-element frames when $M &lt; 2N-1$. We extend this result to subspaces. Several alternative proofs of fundamental results in phase and norm retrieval are also provided.</description>

      <title>Absolutely summing Hankel operators on Fock spaces and the Berger-Coburn phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for $1 \leq p, r &lt; \infty$ we characterize those symbols $f$ so that the induced Hankel operators $H_f$ are $r$-summing from Fock spaces $F^p_\alpha$ to $L^p_\alpha$. The main result shows that the $r$-summing norm of $H_f$ is equivalent to the $\mathrm{IDA}^{\kappa, p}$-norm of $f$, where $\kappa$ is a positive number determined by $p$ and $r$, and the $\mathrm{IDA}$ space is as in [13]. As some application, we discuss the Berger-Coburn phenomenon for $r$-summing Hankel operators on Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Remark Concerning Ces\'aro Operator on the Hardy Space $H^p(\mathbb{C}_+)$ in the Upper Half-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Ces\'aro operator on the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{C}_+)$ in the upper half-plane for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. In \cite{AS} it was proved that for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ the spectrum of the operator $V=\frac{2(p-1)}{p}C-I$ is located on the unit circle and in \cite{ABC1} the authors of this note showed that for $p=2$ operator $V$ is unitary. In the present note we show that for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, $p\ne 2$, the norm of the operator $V$ is strictly greater than one.</description>

      <title>On Hahn-Banach smoothness of $L_1$-preduals and related $w^*-w$ point of continuity of unit balls of dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we intend to study possible $(U)$-embeddings of a Banach space $X$ into $X^{**}$. The canonical embedding of $X$ in $X^{**}$ which possesses $(U)$-embedding is of particular interest and such spaces are known as Hahn-Banach smooth spaces. Separable $L_1$-preduals are characterized which are Hahn-Banach smooth. It is derived that, when $S$ is a compact convex set where each point in $ext(S)$ is a limit point of $ext(S)$ then no subspace of $A(S)$ retains property-$(wU)$ in $A(S)^{**}$. Moreover, if $X$ is an $L_1$-predual where $I:(B_{X^*},w^*)\rightarrow (B_{X^*},w)$ is continuous on $ext (B_{X^*})$ then $X$ is Hahn-Banach smooth, is observed. This means that not all finitely supported elements in $B_{\ell_1}$ can be points of continuity of $I:(B_{\ell_1},w^*(c))\rightarrow (B_{\ell_1},w)$, which is incorrectly stated in \cite{DMR}. Throughout this article this fact is established in a few ways. It is shown that if $L_1(\mu)$ possesses a predual that is weakly Hahn-Banach smooth, then $\mu$ must have a specific characteristic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Talagrand-type Inequalities via Variance Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish dimension-free Talagrand-type variance inequalities on the quantum Boolean cube $M_{2}(\mathbb C)^{\otimes n}$. Motivated by the splitting of the local carr\'e du champ into a conditional-variance term and a pointwise-derivative term, we introduce an $\alpha$-interpolated local gradient $|\nabla_j^{\alpha}A|$ that bridges $\mathrm{Var}_j(A)$ and $|d_jA|^{2}$. For $p\in[1,2],q\in[1,2)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, we prove a Talagrand-type inequality of the form $$\|A\|_\infty^{2-p}\,\bigl\||\nabla^{\alpha}A|\bigr\|_{p}^{p}\ \gtrsim\mathrm{Var}(A)\cdot \max\left\{1, \mathcal{R}(A,q)^{p/2}\right\},$$ where $\mathcal{R}(A,q)$ is a logarithmic ratio quantifying how small either $A-\tau(A)$ or the gradient vector $(d_jA)_j$ is in $L^{q}$ compared to $\mathrm{Var}(A)^{1/2}$. As consequences we derive a quantum Eldan--Gross inequality in terms of the squared $\ell_2$-mass of geometric influences, a quantum Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ inequality, and Talagrand-type $L^{p}$-isoperimetric bounds.
  We further develop a high-order theory by introducing the local variance functional $$V_J(A)=\int_0^\infty 2\mathrm{Inf}^{2}_{J}(P_tA) dt.$$ For $|J|=k$ we prove a local high-order Talagrand inequality relating $\mathrm{Inf}^{p}_{J}[A]$ to $V_J(A)$, with a Talagrand-type logarithmic term when $\mathrm{Inf}^{q}_{J}[A]$ is small. This yields $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ influence inequalities and partial isoperimetric bounds for high-order influences. Our proofs are purely semigroup-based, relying on an improved Lipschitz smoothing estimate for $|\nabla^{\alpha}P_tA|$ obtained from a sharp noncommutative Khintchine inequality and hypercontractivity.</description>

      <title>Tangential boundary behavior in Hilbert spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarason's Hilbert space version of Carath\'eodory-Julia Theorem connects the non-tangential boundary behavior of functions in de Branges-Rovnyak space $H(b)$ with the existence of angular derivatives in the sense of Carath\'eodory for $b$, an analytic self-mapping of the unit disk. In this article, we continue the study of higher order extensions of this result that deal with derivatives of functions in $H(b)$, and we consider notions of approach regions more general than the non-tangential ones. Our main result generalizes the recent work of Duan-Li-Mashreghi on boundary behavior in model spaces to $H(b)$-spaces and to higher order derivatives, and we give a new self-contained proof of that result. It also generalizes earlier radial results of Fricain-Mashreghi. In relation to existence of angular derivatives, we show that in the classical Carath\'eodory-Julia Theorem one cannot replace the non-tangential approach region by any essentially larger region.</description>

We obtain the $q$-Berezin range of some classes of operators on Hardy space. In addition, the convexity of the $q$-Berezin range is explored for finite-rank, diagonal, multiplication, weighted shift, and certain composition operators.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of permuting and preserving curve-bound spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps to $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ from the space of normal (real or complex) $n\times n$, $n\ge 3$ matrices with spectra contained in a given continuous-injection interval image $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ are (a) conjugations; (b) transpose conjugations, or (c) orderings of spectra according to an orientation of $\Lambda$, with fixed eigenspaces. This generalizes results of Petek's (self-maps of real or complex Hermitian matrices) and the author's (complex Hermitian matrices as the domain, $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ as the codomain). An application rules out possibility (c) for normal matrices with spectra constrained to a simple closed curve, extending a result by the author, Gogi\'c and Toma\v{s}evi\'c to the effect that continuous commutativity and spectrum preservers on unitary groups are (transpose) conjugations.
  The involution preserving eigenspaces and complex-conjugating eigenvalues is a novel possibility beyond (a), (b) and (c) if the domain consists of all semisimple operators with $\Lambda$-bound spectra instead; its continuity (or lack thereof) and whether or not that map furthermore extends continuously to arbitrary $\Lambda$-constrained-spectrum matrices hinge on the geometry and regularity of $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Separation properties of a hybrid point process with determinantal radii and uniform arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently characterized the separated determinantal point processes $\Lambda_\phi$ associated with Fock spaces $\mathcal F_\phi$ in the plane with doubling weight $\phi$. We also showed that, as expected, a more restrictive condition is required to characterize the separated Poisson processes with the same first intensities as $\Lambda_\phi$. To gain further insight into this different behavior, we center our attention to radial weights $\phi(z)$ and introduce a hybrid process $\Lambda_\phi^M=\{r_k e^{i\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$, where the moduli $r_k$ are taken from $\Lambda_\phi$, while the arguments $\theta_k$ are chosen independently and uniformly in $[0,2\pi)$. Our main result is that $\Lambda_\phi^M$ is almost surely separated if and only if its first intensity satisfies the same condition as in the Poisson case.</description>

      <title>Tameness of actions on finite rank median algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In compact finite-rank median algebras, we prove that the geometric rank equals the independence number of all continuous median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$. Combined with Rosenthal's dichotomy, this yields a generalized Helly selection principle: for Boolean-tame (e.g., finite-rank) median algebras, the space of median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact in the pointwise topology. Using the Bourgain-Fremlin-Talagrand theorem, we show that the set $\mathcal{BV}_r(X,[0,1])$ of $r$-bounded variation functions is a Rosenthal compact for every compact metrizable finite-rank median algebra $X$. Generalizing joint results with E. Glasner on dendrons (rank-1), we establish that every continuous action of a topological group $G$ by median automorphisms on a finite-rank compact median algebra is Rosenthal representable, hence dynamically tame. As an application, the Roller-Fioravanti compactification of any finite-rank topological median $G$-algebra with compact intervals is a dynamically tame $G$-system.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropic Balian-Low Phenomenon and the Variational Construction of Wavelet Frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of wavelet frames within anisotropic function spaces. By replacing classical integral estimates with a matrix algebra approach, we establish the boundedness of frame operators and derive optimal dual wavelets via variational principles. Our analysis reveals fundamental geometric obstructions, identified here as an anisotropic Balian-Low phenomenon, which preclude the existence of tight frames for isotropic generators in high-shear regimes. Furthermore, we apply these results to determine sharp constants for Sobolev embeddings, explicitly quantifying the impact of dilation geometry on analytic stability.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Bargmann Invariants: Geometric Foundations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, a class of gauge-invariant quantities arising from the overlaps of quantum state vectors, provide a profound and unifying framework for understanding the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary equivalence and constructing a complete set of polynomial invariants for mixed states. Furthermore, we explore their pivotal role in modern quantum information science, specifically in developing operational methods for entanglement detection without the need for full state tomography. By synthesizing historical context with recent advances, this survey aims to highlight Bargmann invariants not merely as mathematical curiosities, but as essential instruments for probing the relational and geometric features of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Horizon Activation Mapping for Neural Networks in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.</description>

      <title>Lamperti Operators, Dilation Theory, and Applications in Noncommutative Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel framework for quantitative mean ergodic theorems in the noncommutative setting, with a focus on actions of amenable groups and semigroups. We prove square function inequalities for ergodic averages arising from actions of groups of polynomial volume growth on a fixed noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\8$. To achieve this, we establish two endpoint estimates for a noncommutative square function on non-homogeneous space. Our approach relies on semi-commutative non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, including the non-doubling Calder\'on-Zygmund arguments for non-smooth kernels and $\mathrm{BMO}$ space theory, operator-valued inequalities related to balls and cubes in groups equipped with non-doubling measures, and a noncommutative generalization of the classical transference method for amenable group actions. As an application, we establish a quantitative ergodic theorem for the ergodic averages associated with the positive power of modulus representation arising from a Lamperti representation on noncommutative $L_p$-spaces, extending some results in \cite{Templeman2015}. To obtain quantitative ergodic theorem for semigroups of operators, in this paper, we address the open question of extending dilation theorem of Fackler-Gl\"uck from single operators to commuting tuples on Banach spaces including noncommutative $L_p$-spaces. Indeed our approach provides genuine joint $N$-dilations for commuting families, unifying and extending the classical dilation theorems of Sz.-Nagy--Foia\c{s} and Ak\c{c}oglu--Sucheston for a natural class of commuting tuple of contractions extending the abstract dilation theorem of of Fackler-Gl\"uck for commuting tuple of contractions. This enables us to obtain a quantitative ergodic theorem for a large class of semigroups of operators on $\mathbb{R}^d_{+}$.</description>

      <title>Frobenius Theorem in Banach Space and Generalized Inverse Analysis Method of Operators Under Small Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.01327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be an open set in Banach space $E$, $M(x)$ for $x\in \Lambda $ be a subspace in $E$, and $x_0$ be a point in $\Lambda $. We consider the family $\mathcal{F}=\{M(x):\forall x\in\Lambda\}$, but the dimension of $M(x)$ can be infinite, and investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{F}$ being $c^1$ integrable at $x_0$. Without new idea and method, it is difficult to generalize the classical Frobenius theorem in Euclid space to the infinite-dimensional $M (x)$ case. We first define the co-tailed set $J (x_0, E_ *)$ of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x_0$ so that for each $x$ in $J (x_0, E_ *)$, $M (x)$ has a unique operator value coordinate $\alpha(x)$ in $B(M (x_0), E_*),$ and prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is integrable at $x_0$, $J (x_0, E_ *)$ must contain the integrable submanifold of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x_0$. Then, we present the desired necessary and sufficient conditions, which is the Frobenius theorem in the Banach space.It is well known that the classical Frobenius theorem is an important fundamental theorem in the fields of differential topology, differential geometry, differential equations, etc. However, they are all limited to cases where all $\mbox{dim}M(x)&lt; \infty.$ It is now possible to generalize previous studies to the case of $\mbox{dim} M(x)=\infty.$ Using the generalized inverse analysis method of operators under small perturbations, we not only prove Frobenius theorem, but also give some applications to the initial value problem of differential equations with geometric significance, global analysis and the extremum principle under the submanifold constraint in Banach space. In particular, in the field of infinite dimensional geometric and functional analysis, these studies seem to belong to new results and are still in the preliminary stage.</description>

      <title>Energy Propagation in Scattering Convolution Networks Can Be Arbitrarily Slow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze energy decay for deep convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, including Mallat's wavelet scattering transform. For time-frequency scattering transforms based on Gabor filters, previous work has established that energy decay is exponential for arbitrary square-integrable input signals. In contrast, our main results allow proving that this is false for wavelet scattering in arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, we show that the energy decay of wavelet and wavelet-like scattering transforms acting on generic square-integrable signals can be arbitrarily slow. Importantly, this slow decay behavior holds for dense subsets of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, indicating that rapid energy decay is generally an unstable property of signals. We complement these findings with positive results that allow us to infer fast (up to exponential) energy decay for generalized Sobolev spaces tailored to the frequency localization of the underlying filter bank. Both negative and positive results highlight that energy decay in scattering networks critically depends on the interplay between the respective frequency localizations of both the signal and the filters used.</description>

      <title>Characterization of decay rates for discrete operator semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a power-bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space $X$, and let $S$ be a bounded linear operator from another Hilbert space $Y$ to $X$. We investigate the non-exponential rate of decay of $\|T^nS\|$ as $n \to \infty$. First, when $X = Y$ and $S$ commutes with $T$, we characterize the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ in terms of the growth rate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$ as $|\lambda| \downarrow 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Next, we provide another characterization by means of an integral estimate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$. The second characterization is then applied to asymptotic estimates for perturbed discrete operator semigroups. Finally, we present some results on the relation between the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ and the boundedness of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\|T^nSy\|^p$ for all $y \in Y$ in the Banach space setting, where $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to(0,\infty)$ and $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Petty's projection inequality is a sharp upper bound for the volume of the polar projection body of a convex body. Lutwak introduced the concept of mixed projection bodies and extended Petty's projection inequality. Alonso-Guti\'{e}rrez later did a stability result for Petty's projection inequality.
  In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order setting and extended the difference body to that setting. In a previous work, we, working with Haddad, Putterman, Roysdon, and Ye, established an extension of the projection body operator to this setting. In this note, we continue this study for the mixed projection body operator as well as the question of stability.</description>

Abstract: We study random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii in the Nevanlinna and Smirnov classes. As it turns out these are characterized by the Blaschke condition. This follows from a more general result. Indeed, we show that this characterization is true in so-called big Hardy-Orlicz spaces. It is noteworthy to mention that conditions for deterministic interpolation in these spaces are given by harmonic majorants, the existence of which is difficult to check in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We note a characterization of the amenability of unitary representations (in the sense of Bekka) via the existence of an orthonormal basis supporting an invariant probability charge. Based on this, we explore several natural notions of amenable near representations on Hilbert spaces. Establishing an analogue of a theorem about sofic groups by Elek and Szab\'o, we prove that a group is hyperlinear if and only if it admits an essentially free amenable near representation. This answers a question raised by Pestov and Kwiatkowska. For comparison, we also provide characterizations of Kirchberg's factorization property, as well as Haagerup's property, along similar lines.</description>

We derive a closed spectral formula for this distance and extend the framework to \emph{directional robustness} against arbitrary completely positive maps, establishing stability and tensor-product properties. Expanding this to the intermediate cones of $k$-positive maps, we introduce a \emph{hierarchy of deviation}, $d_k(\Phi)$. We derive a spectral formula for $d_k$ based on entanglement depth and demonstrate that it serves as an optimal threshold for certifying Schmidt numbers, allowing for the universal construction of dimension-sensitive entanglement witnesses.</description>

      <title>Inner approximations of doubling weights with applications to Beurling-Malliavin theory in Toeplitz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a strictly increasing smooth function, such that $f'$ is comparable to a weight $\alpha'$ which is locally doubling and satisfies a non-triviality condition to be explained in the paper. We construct a meromorphic inner function $J$, such that $f-\arg(J)$ is bounded and $\arg(J)'$ is comparable to $\alpha'$ up to polynomial loss. We give two applications of this result. The first is a sufficient density condition for a set $\Lambda$ to be a zero set for a Toeplitz kernel with real analytic and unimodular symbol. Our second application is to describe a class of admissible Beurling-Malliavin majorants in model spaces. The generality considered here lets us treat most cases of model spaces generated by one-component inner functions.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics (governing sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetry and an established strengthening of log-Sobolev inequality -- namely, nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime (concerning constant-volume sets), expressed as the Gaussian isoperimetric profile times the square root of spectral gap. Furthermore, we apply our results to establish quantitative relations among optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities, additionally covering isoperimetry for subexponentially and superexponentially small sets. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Qualification-free convex analysis via the joint supporting subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In convex analysis, qualification conditions (also termed constraint qualifications) help avoid pathological behavior at domain boundaries. In this work we remove the need for such conditions by localizing to an affine subspace -- the joint supporting subspace -- that contains the feasible region and ensures qualification conditions hold after localization.
  Our theory generalizes Borwein and Wolkowicz's facial reduction beyond conic programs to convex programs of the form $f(x) + g(Ax)$. Intuitively, the joint supporting subspace corresponds to a bilateral facial reduction between any two convex sets. It enables simple qualification-free generalizations for a host of central results of convex analysis. These include: an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions; attained infimal convolution for convex conjugates; subdifferential sum and chain rules; and a characterization of the normal cones of the intersection of two convex sets. All generalizations reduce seamlessly to their original formulations when qualification conditions hold.
  We offer a number of characterizations for the joint supporting subspace, one of which is constructive. Our proofs are self-contained, and introduce a novel theoretical framework consisting of nested normals and supporting subspaces, which simultaneously describe both the boundary of convex sets and the lattice of faces.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the conformal class of the standard metric on the $3$-sphere, we prove a quantitative refinement of the Andrews-De Lellis-Topping inequality in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. This inequality is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore referred to as almost-Schur lemma. Hence, our stability result may be viewed as an almost-almost-Schur lemma.
  As a consequence, we deduce via interpolation the quantitative stability of an entire family of nonlinear Yamabe-type inequalities, including an inequality for the total volume-normalized $\sigma_2$-curvature $\mathcal F_2$. This extends a recent result by Frank and the second author for $d &gt; 4$ to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric minimizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d &gt; 4$, it maximizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d=3$. This is the main challenge in treating the case $d=3$ as it turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Busemann-Petty Problem for Arbitrary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Busemann-Petty problem asks whether smaller central hyperplane sections of origin-symmetric convex bodies necessarily imply smaller total volume. Zvavitch studied this question for arbitrary measures with continuous even densities, providing sufficient conditions for affirmative cases in terms of the distributional behavior of the ratio between the densities involved. We refine this result by extending it to a broader class of distributions and allowing a distinct pair of densities for each body, one for hyperplane sections and another for the full volume. We also present some examples illustrating cases not covered by previous results.</description>
