      <title>SketchDream: Sketch-based Text-to-3D Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-based 3D generation methods generate attractive results but lack detailed geometry control. Sketches, known for their conciseness and expressiveness, have contributed to intuitive 3D modeling but are confined to producing texture-less mesh models within predefined categories. Integrating sketch and text simultaneously for 3D generation promises enhanced control over geometry and appearance but faces challenges from 2D-to-3D translation ambiguity and multi-modal condition integration. Moreover, further editing of 3D models in arbitrary views will give users more freedom to customize their models. However, it is difficult to achieve high generation quality, preserve unedited regions, and manage proper interactions between shape components. To solve the above issues, we propose a text-driven 3D content generation and editing method, SketchDream, which supports NeRF generation from given hand-drawn sketches and achieves free-view sketch-based local editing. To tackle the 2D-to-3D ambiguity challenge, we introduce a sketch-based multi-view image generation diffusion model, which leverages depth guidance to establish spatial correspondence. A 3D ControlNet with a 3D attention module is utilized to control multi-view images and ensure their 3D consistency. To support local editing, we further propose a coarse-to-fine editing approach: the coarse phase analyzes component interactions and provides 3D masks to label edited regions, while the fine stage generates realistic results with refined details by local enhancement. Extensive experiments validate that our method generates higher-quality results compared with a combination of 2D ControlNet and image-to-3D generation techniques and achieves detailed control compared with existing diffusion-based 3D editing approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural radiance fields-based holography [Invited]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for generating holograms based on the neural radiance fields (NeRF) technique. Generating three-dimensional (3D) data is difficult in hologram computation. NeRF is a state-of-the-art technique for 3D light-field reconstruction from 2D images based on volume rendering. The NeRF can rapidly predict new-view images that do not include a training dataset. In this study, we constructed a rendering pipeline directly from a 3D light field generated from 2D images by NeRF for hologram generation using deep neural networks within a reasonable time. The pipeline comprises three main components: the NeRF, a depth predictor, and a hologram generator, all constructed using deep neural networks. The pipeline does not include any physical calculations. The predicted holograms of a 3D scene viewed from any direction were computed using the proposed pipeline. The simulation and experimental results are presented.</description>

      <title>Rasterized Edge Gradients: Handling Discontinuities Differentiably</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the gradients of a rendering process is paramount for diverse applications in computer vision and graphics. However, accurate computation of these gradients is challenging due to discontinuities and rendering approximations, particularly for surface-based representations and rasterization-based rendering. We present a novel method for computing gradients at visibility discontinuities for rasterization-based differentiable renderers. Our method elegantly simplifies the traditionally complex problem through a carefully designed approximation strategy, allowing for a straightforward, effective, and performant solution. We introduce a novel concept of micro-edges, which allows us to treat the rasterized images as outcomes of a differentiable, continuous process aligned with the inherently non-differentiable, discrete-pixel rasterization. This technique eliminates the necessity for rendering approximations or other modifications to the forward pass, preserving the integrity of the rendered image, which makes it applicable to rasterized masks, depth, and normals images where filtering is prohibitive. Utilizing micro-edges simplifies gradient interpretation at discontinuities and enables handling of geometry intersections, offering an advantage over the prior art. We showcase our method in dynamic human head scene reconstruction, demonstrating effective handling of camera images and segmentation masks.</description>

      <title>Free-Moving Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation with Virtual Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for reconstructing free-moving object from a monocular RGB video. Most existing methods either assume scene prior, hand pose prior, object category pose prior, or rely on local optimization with multiple sequence segments. We propose a method that allows free interaction with the object in front of a moving camera without relying on any prior, and optimizes the sequence globally without any segments. We progressively optimize the object shape and pose simultaneously based on an implicit neural representation. A key aspect of our method is a virtual camera system that reduces the search space of the optimization significantly. We evaluate our method on the standard HO3D dataset and a collection of egocentric RGB sequences captured with a head-mounted device. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms most methods significantly, and is on par with recent techniques that assume prior information.</description>
