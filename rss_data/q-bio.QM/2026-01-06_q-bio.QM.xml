      <title>Deep Learning Framework for RNA Inverse Folding with Geometric Structure Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA's diverse biological functions stem from its structural versatility, yet accurately predicting and designing RNA sequences given a 3D conformation (inverse folding) remains a challenge. Here, I introduce a deep learning framework that integrates Geometric Vector Perceptron (GVP) layers with a Transformer architecture to enable end-to-end RNA design. I construct a dataset consisting of experimentally solved RNA 3D structures, filtered and deduplicated from the BGSU RNA list, and evaluate performance using both sequence recovery rate and TM-score to assess sequence and structural fidelity, respectively. On standard benchmarks and RNA-Puzzles, my model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with recovery and TM-scores of 0.481 and 0.332, surpassing existing methods across diverse RNA families and length scales. Masked family-level validation using Rfam annotations confirms strong generalization beyond seen families. Furthermore, inverse-folded sequences, when refolded using AlphaFold3, closely resemble native structures, highlighting the critical role of geometric features captured by GVP layers in enhancing Transformer-based RNA design.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Formula and Structure Prediction from Tandem Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics and exposomics aim to measure detectable small molecules in biological samples. The results facilitate hypothesis-generating discovery of metabolic changes and disease mechanisms and provide information about environmental exposures and their effects on human health. Metabolomics and exposomics are made possible by the high resolving power of LC and high mass measurement accuracy of MS. However, a majority of the signals from such studies still cannot be identified or annotated using conventional library searching because existing spectral libraries are far from covering the vast chemical space captured by LC-MS/MS. To address this challenge and unleash the full potential of metabolomics and exposomics, a number of computational approaches have been developed to predict compounds based on tandem mass spectra. Published assessment of these approaches used different datasets and evaluation. To select prediction workflows for practical applications and identify areas for further improvements, we have carried out a systematic evaluation of the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. Specifically, the accuracy of formula prediction and structure prediction was evaluated for different types of adducts. The resulting findings have established realistic performance baselines, identified critical bottlenecks, and provided guidance to further improve compound predictions based on MS.</description>

      <title>HyperNetWalk: A Unified Framework for Personalized and Population-Level Cancer Driver Gene Identification via Multi-Network Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying cancer driver genes is crucial for understanding tumor biology and developing precision therapies. However, existing computational methods often rely on single biological networks or population-level mutation patterns, limiting their ability to identify patient-specific drivers and leverage the complementary information from multiple network types. Here, we present HyperNetWalk, a novel computational framework that integrates multiple biological networks and hypergraph diffusion to identify driver genes at both personalized and cohort levels. In the first stage, HyperNetWalk integrates protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and dynamic co-expression networks through sample-independent random walks on patient-specific subnetworks to capture topological importance and expression perturbation effects. In the second stage, it refines predictions through hypergraph-based random walks that leverage cross-sample information while preserving individual mutational contexts. Comprehensive evaluation on 12 TCGA cancer types demonstrates that HyperNetWalk achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both personalized and cohort-level predictions. Notably, HyperNetWalk successfully identifies known driver genes with high precision while revealing cancer type-specific drivers that reflect distinct biological mechanisms. Our framework provides a unified solution for personalized and population-based driver gene identification, offering valuable insights for precision oncology and therapeutic target discovery.</description>

      <title>Beyond P-Values: Importing Quantitative Finance's Risk and Regret Metrics for AI in Learning Health Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings challenges foundational assumptions underlying traditional frameworks of medical evidence. Classical statistical approaches, centered on randomized controlled trials, frequentist hypothesis testing, and static confidence intervals, were designed for fixed interventions evaluated under stable conditions. In contrast, AI-driven clinical systems learn continuously, adapt their behavior over time, and operate in non-stationary environments shaped by evolving populations, practices, and feedback effects. In such systems, clinical harm arises less from average error rates than from calibration drift, rare but severe failures, and the accumulation of suboptimal decisions over time.
  In this perspective, we argue that prevailing notions of statistical significance are insufficient for characterizing evidence and safety in learning health systems. Drawing on risk-theoretic concepts from quantitative finance and online decision theory, we propose reframing medical evidence for adaptive AI systems in terms of time-indexed calibration stability, bounded downside risk, and controlled cumulative regret. We emphasize that this approach does not replace randomized trials or causal inference, but complements them by addressing dimensions of risk and uncertainty that emerge only after deployment. This framework provides a principled mathematical language for evaluating AI-driven clinical systems under continual learning and offers implications for clinical practice, research design, and regulatory oversight.</description>

      <title>Model-Assisted Causal Inference for the Treatment Effect on Recurrent Events in the Presence of Terminal Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by evaluating the benefits of patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in end-stage heart failure management inference, in which hypothesis testing for a treatment effect on the risk of recurrent events is challenged in the presence of terminal events. Existing methods based on cumulative frequency unreasonably disadvantage longer survivors as they tend to experience more recurrent events. The While-Alive-based (WA) test has provided a solution to address this survival-length-bias problem, and it performs well when the recurrent event rate holds constant over time. However, if such a constant-rate assumption is violated, the WA test can exhibit an inflated type I error and inaccurate estimation of treatment effects. To fill this methodological gap, we propose a Proportional Rate Marginal Structural Model-assisted Test (PR-MSMaT) in the causal inference framework of separable treatment effects for recurrent and terminal events. Using the simulation study, we demonstrate that our PR-MSMaT can properly control type I error while gaining power comparable to the WA test under time-varying recurrent event rates. We employ PR-MSMaT to compare different MCS devices with the postoperative risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support program.</description>

      <title>Toward Auditable Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning in Pathology: SQL as an Explicit Trace of Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated pathology image analysis is central to clinical diagnosis, but clinicians still ask which slide features drive a model's decision and why. Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations. Extensive experiments evaluated on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate our method improves interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.</description>

      <title>Edge-aware GAT-based protein binding site prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of protein binding sites is crucial for understanding biomolecular interaction mechanisms and for the rational design of drug targets. Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/. In summary, our approach offers a novel and efficient solution that balances prediction accuracy, generalization, and interpretability for identifying functional sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Group lasso based selection for high-dimensional mediation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mediation analysis aims to identify and estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome that is mediated through one or more intermediate variables. In the presence of multiple intermediate variables, two pertinent methodological questions arise: estimating mediated effects when mediators are correlated, and performing high-dimensional mediation analyses when the number of mediators exceeds the sample size. This paper presents a two-step procedure for high-dimensional mediation analyses. The first step selects a reduced number of candidate mediators using an ad-hoc lasso penalty. The second step applies a procedure we previously developed to estimate the mediated effects, accounting for the correlation structure among the retained candidate mediators. We compare the performance of the proposed two-step procedure with state-of-the-art methods using simulated data. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical application by estimating the causal role of DNA methylation in the pathway between smoking and rheumatoid arthritis using real data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying AI-to-Clinical Translation: The Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Despite high in-silico performance (AUC &gt;0.80), 85% of AI cancer biomarkers fail clinical translation, exposing a critical algorithm-to-outcome gap. Methods: We introduce the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) framework, integrating model accuracy (AUC), clinical correlation (Corr), and trial heterogeneity. We validated AOC across 6 neoantigen vaccine trials (2017-2025) and 3 independent melanoma immunotherapy cohorts (n=188 patients). Results: AOC ranged 0.18-0.79 across trials, with failed trials (ORR &lt;15%) showing AOC &lt;0.40. External validation revealed unstable algorithm-outcome correlation (C-index: 0.49-0.61, p&gt;0.05), demonstrating the necessity of explicit concordance assessment. Conclusions: AOC provides a quantitative framework for pre-trial risk assessment and adaptive trial design. Prospective validation is underway in KEYNOTE-942 extension studies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part I -- Phenomenological descriptions and microscopic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate depends on temperature, yet the resulting rate-temperature relationships often deviate strongly from simple Arrhenius behavior. In this first part of a two-part review, we survey empirical and phenomenological models used to describe biological temperature responses across scales, from enzymatic reactions to organismal performance. We discuss common functional forms, including symmetric and asymmetric thermal performance curves and extensions of the Arrhenius law, and we highlight how these models define operational quantities such as optimal temperatures, thermal breadths, and thermal limits. In Part II of this review, we will discuss how system-level temperature response curves emerge from the interaction of many underlying reactions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying task-relevant representational similarity using decision variable correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</description>
