      <title>Maximum Reachability Orientation of Mixed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to find orientations of mixed graphs optimizing the total reachability, a problem that has applications in causality and biology. For given a digraph $D$, we use $P(D)$ for the set of ordered pairs of distinct vertices in $V(D)$ and we define $\kappa_D:P(D)\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ by $\kappa_D(u,v)=1$ if $v$ is reachable from $u$ in $D$, and $\kappa_D(u,v)=0$, otherwise. We use $R(D)=\sum_{(u,v)\in P(D)}\kappa_D(u,v)$.
  Now, given a mixed graph $G$, we aim to find an orientation $\vec{G}$ of $G$ that maximizes $R(\vec{G})$. Hakimi, Schmeichel, and Young proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to undirected inputs. They inquired about the complexity in mixed graphs.
  We answer this question by showing that this problem is NP-hard, and, moreover, APX-hard.
  We then develop a finer understanding of how quickly the problem becomes difficult when going from undirected to mixed graphs. To this end, we consider the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to the number $k$ of preoriented arcs of $G$, a new form of parameterization.
  We show that the problem can be solved in $n^{O(k)}$ and that a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation can be computed in $f(k,\epsilon)n^{O(1)}$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for the Ideal Proof System in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove upper and lower bounds over fields of positive characteristics for several fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS), an algebraic proof system introduced by Grochow and Pitassi (J. ACM 2018). Our results extend the works of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret, and Wigderson (Theory of Computing 2021) and also of Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret (FOCS 2022). These works primarily focused on proof systems over fields of characteristic $0$, and we are able to extend these results to positive characteristic.
  The question of proving general IPS lower bounds over positive characteristic is motivated by the important question of proving $AC^{0}[p]$-Frege lower bounds. This connection was observed by Grochow and Pitassi (J. ACM 2018). Additional motivation comes from recent developments in algebraic complexity theory due to Forbes (CCC 2024) who showed how to extend previous lower bounds over characteristic $0$ to positive characteristic.
  In our work, we adapt the functional lower bound method of Forbes et al. (Theory of Computing 2021) to prove exponential-size lower bounds for various subsystems of IPS. Additionally, we derive upper bounds for the instances presented above. We show that they have efficient constant-depth IPS refutations. We also show that constant-depth IPS can efficiently refute a general class of instances, namely all symmetric instances, thereby further uncovering the strength of these algebraic proofs in positive characteristic.
  Notably, our lower bounds hold for fields of arbitrary characteristic but require the field size to be $n^{\omega(1)}$. In a concurrent work, Elbaz, Govindasamy, Lu, and Tzameret have shown lower bounds against restricted classes of IPS over finite fields of any size by considering different hard instances.</description>

      <title>Bounded Distance Decoding for Random Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper investigates the bounded distance decoding (BDD) problem for ensembles of lattices whose generator matrices have sub-Gaussian entries. We first prove that, for these ensembles the BDD problem is NP-hard in the worst case. Then, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and establish, both theoretically and through extensive experiments, that, for a random selected lattice from the same ensemble, the algorithm solves the BDD problem with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first example of a lattice problem that is NP-hard in the worst case yet admits a polynomial time algorithm on the average case.</description>

      <title>The Proof Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atserias and M\"uller (JACM, 2020) proved that for every unsatisfiable CNF formula $\varphi$, the formula $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$, stating "$\varphi$ has small Resolution refutations", does not have subexponential-size Resolution refutations. Conversely, when $\varphi$ is satisfiable, Pudl\'ak (TCS, 2003) showed how to construct a polynomial-size Resolution refutation of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$ given a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$. A question that remained open is: do all short Resolution refutations of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$ explicitly leak a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$?
  We answer this question affirmatively by giving a polynomial-time algorithm that extracts a satisfying assignment for $\varphi$ given any short Resolution refutation of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$. The algorithm follows from a new feasibly constructive proof of the Atserias-M\"uller lower bound, formalizable in Cook's theory $\mathsf{PV_1}$ of bounded arithmetic.
  Motivated by this, we introduce a computational problem concerning Resolution lower bounds: the Proof Analysis Problem (PAP). For a proof system $Q$, the Proof Analysis Problem for $Q$ asks, given a CNF formula $\varphi$ and a $Q$-proof of a Resolution lower bound for $\varphi$, encoded as $\neg \operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$, whether $\varphi$ is satisfiable. In contrast to PAP for Resolution, we prove that PAP for Extended Frege (EF) is NP-complete.
  Our results yield new insights into proof complexity: (i) every proof system simulating EF is (weakly) automatable if and only if it is (weakly) automatable on formulas stating Resolution lower bounds; (ii) we provide Ref formulas exponentially hard for bounded-depth Frege systems; and (iii) for every strong enough theory of arithmetic $T$ we construct unsatisfiable CNF formulas exponentially hard for Resolution but for which $T$ cannot prove even a quadratic lower bound.</description>

      <title>Quantum k-SAT Related Hypergraph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum k-SAT problem is the quantum generalization of the k-SAT problem. It is the problem whether a given local Hamiltonian is frustration-free. Frustration-free means that the ground state of the k-local Hamiltonian minimizes the energy of every local interaction term simultaneously. This is a central question in quantum physics and a canonical QMA_1-complete problem. The Quantum k-SAT problem is not as well studied as the classical k-SAT problem in terms of special tractable cases, approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. In this paper, we will give a graph-theoretic study of the Quantum k-SAT problem with the structures core and radius. These hypergraph structures are important to solve the Quantum k-SAT problem. We can solve a Quantum k-SAT instance in polynomial time if the derived hypergraph has a core of size n-m+a, where a is a constant, and the radius is at most logarithmic. If it exists, we can find a core of size n-m+a with the best possible radius in polynomial time, whereas finding a general minimum core with minimal radius is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds against the Ideal Proof System in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lower bounds against strong algebraic proof systems and specifically fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS), have been obtained in an ongoing line of work. All of these bounds, however, are proved only over large (or characteristic $0$) fields, yet finite fields are the more natural setting for propositional proof complexity, especially for progress toward lower bounds for Frege systems such as $AC^0[p]$-Frege. This work establishes lower bounds against fragments of IPS over fixed finite fields. Specifically, we show that a variant of the knapsack instance studied by Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret (FOCS'22) has no polynomial-size IPS refutation over finite fields when the refutation is multilinear and written as a constant-depth circuit. The key ingredient of our argument is the recent set-multilinearization result of Forbes (CCC'24), which extends the earlier result of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas (FOCS'21) to all fields, and an extension of the techniques of Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret to finite fields. We also separate this proof system from the one studied by Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret.
  In addition, we present new lower bounds for read-once algebraic branching program refutations, roABP-IPS, in finite fields, extending results of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret, and Wigderson (Theor. of Comput.'21) and Hakoniemi, Limaye, and Tzameret (STOC'24).
  Finally, we show that any lower bound against any proof system at least as strong as (non-multilinear) constant-depth IPS over finite fields for any instance, even a purely algebraic instance (i.e., not a translation of a Boolean formula or CNF), implies a hard CNF formula for the respective IPS fragment, and hence an $AC^0[p]$-Frege lower bound by known simulations over finite fields (Grochow and Pitassi (J. ACM'18)).</description>

      <title>Bounds for Geometric rank in Terms of Subrank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For tensors of fixed order, we establish three types of upper bounds for the geometric rank in terms of the subrank. Firstly, we prove that, under a mild condition on the characteristic of the base field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank in some field extension of bounded degree. Secondly, we show that, over any algebraically closed field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank. Lastly, we prove that, for any order three tensor over an arbitrary field, its geometric rank is bounded by a quadratic polynomial in its subrank. Our results have several immediate but interesting implications: (1) We answer an open question posed by Kopparty, Moshkovitz and Zuiddam concerning the relation between the subrank and the geometric rank; (2) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi-Chang- Draisma-Rupniewski (resp. Derksen-Makam-Zuiddam) theorem on the growth rate of the border subrank (resp. subrank), in an optimal way; (3) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi- Draisma-Eggleston theorem on the stability of the subrank, from the real field to an arbitrary field; (4) We confirm the open problem raised by Derksen, Makam and Zuiddam on the maximality of the gap between the subrank of the direct sum and the sum of subranks; (5) We derive, for the first time, a de-bordering result for the border subrank and upper bounds for the partition rank and analytic rank in terms of the subrank; (6) We reprove a gap result for the subrank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of computation are not just logical, but physical. We investigate the physical resources -- time, energy, entropy, and free energy -- required to perform computational work. We apply the resulting measures of physical complexity to conventional electronic computers, to quantum computers, to biological systems, to black holes, and to the universe itself, with implications for artificial intelligence development where biological efficiency limits suggest new computational paradigms beyond current digital architectures.</description>

      <title>A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in $\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better sample complexity, and is simpler.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus Classical Separation in Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum versus classical separation plays a central role in understanding the advantages of quantum computation. In this paper, we present the first exponential separation between quantum and bounded-error randomized communication complexity in a variant of the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model. Namely, the three-player Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead model. Specifically, we introduce the Gadgeted Hidden Matching Problem and show that it can be solved using only $O(\log n)$ simultaneous quantum communication. In contrast, any simultaneous randomized protocol requires $\Omega(n^{1/16})$ communication.
  On the technical side, a key obstacle in separating quantum and classical communication in NOF models is that all known randomized NOF lower bound tools, such as the discrepancy method, typically apply to both randomized and quantum protocols. In this regard, our technique provides a new method for proving randomized lower bounds in the NOF setting and may be of independent interest beyond the separation result.</description>

      <title>On the Characteristic Polynomial of Linearized Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a finite field, and $L$ be a $q$-linearized polynomial defined over $k$ of $q$-degree $r$ ($L=\sum^r_{i=0}a_iZ^{q^i}$, with $a_i\in k$). This paper provides an algorithm to compute a characteristic polynomial of $L$ over a large extension field $\mathbb F_{q^n}\supseteq k$. Our algorithm has computational complexity of $O(n(\log(n))^4)$ in terms of $\mathbb F_q$ operations with the implied constant depending only on $k$ and $r$. Up to logarithmic factors, and for linear maps represented by low degree polynomials, this provides a square root improvement over generic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Large Average Subtensor Problem: Ground-State, Algorithms, and Algorithmic Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the large average subtensor problem: given an order-$p$ tensor over $\mathbb{R}^{N\times \cdots \times N}$ with i.i.d. standard normal entries and a $k\in\mathbb{N}$, algorithmically find a $k\times \cdots \times k$ subtensor with a large average entry. This generalizes the large average submatrix problem, a key model closely related to biclustering and high-dimensional data analysis, to tensors. For the submatrix case, Bhamidi, Dey, and Nobel~\cite{bhamidi2017energy} explicitly highlight the regime $k=\Theta(N)$ as an intriguing open question.
  Addressing the regime $k=\Theta(N)$ for tensors, we establish that the largest average entry concentrates around an explicit value $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, provided that the tensor order $p$ is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we prove that for any $\gamma&gt;0$ and large $p$, this model exhibits multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP) above the threshold $\gamma E_{\mathrm{max}}$. The $m$-OGP serves as a rigorous barrier for a broad class of algorithms exhibiting input stability. These results hold for both $k=\Theta(N)$ and $k=o(N)$. Moreover, for small $k$, specifically $k=o(\log^{1.5}N)$, we show that a certain polynomial-time algorithm identifies a subtensor with average entry $\frac{2\sqrt{p}}{p+1}E_{\mathrm{max}}$. In particular, the $m$-OGP is asymptotically sharp: onset of the $m$-OGP and the algorithmic threshold match as $p$ grows.
  Our results show that while the case $k=\Theta(N)$ remains open for submatrices, it can be rigorously analyzed for tensors in the large $p$ regime. This is achieved by interpreting the model as a Boolean spin glass and drawing on insights from recent advances in the Ising $p$-spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Instance complexity of Boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the area of query complexity of Boolean functions, the most widely studied cost measure of an algorithm is the worst-case number of queries made by it on an input. Motivated by the most natural cost measure studied in online algorithms, the competitive ratio, we consider a different cost measure for query algorithms for Boolean functions that captures the ratio of the cost of the algorithm and the cost of an optimal algorithm that knows the input in advance. The cost of an algorithm is its largest cost over all inputs. Grossman, Komargodski and Naor [ITCS'20] introduced this measure for Boolean functions, and dubbed it instance complexity. Grossman et al. showed, among other results, that monotone Boolean functions with instance complexity 1 are precisely those that depend on one or two variables.
  We complement the above-mentioned result of Grossman et al. by completely characterizing the instance complexity of symmetric Boolean functions. As a corollary we conclude that the only symmetric Boolean functions with instance complexity 1 are the Parity function and its complement. We also study the instance complexity of some graph properties like Connectivity and k-clique containment.
  In all the Boolean functions we study above, and those studied by Grossman et al., the instance complexity turns out to be the ratio of query complexity to minimum certificate complexity. It is a natural question to ask if this is the correct bound for all Boolean functions. We show a negative answer in a very strong sense, by analyzing the instance complexity of the Greater-Than and Odd-Max-Bit functions. We show that the above-mentioned ratio is linear in the input size for both of these functions, while we exhibit algorithms for which the instance complexity is a constant.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Injectivity and Verification of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine learning. Understanding the functions represented by ReLU networks is a major topic in current research as this enables a better interpretability of learning processes. Injectivity of a function computed by a ReLU network, that is, the question if different inputs to the network always lead to different outputs, plays a crucial role whenever invertibility of the function is required, such as, e.g., for inverse problems or generative models. The exact computational complexity of deciding injectivity was recently posed as an open problem (Puthawala et al. [JMLR 2022]). We answer this question by proving coNP-completeness. On the positive side, we show that the problem for a single ReLU-layer is still tractable for small input dimension; more precisely, we present a parameterized algorithm which yields fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the input dimension. In addition, we study the network verification problem which is to verify that certain inputs only yield specific outputs. This is of great importance since neural networks are increasingly used in safety-critical systems. We prove that network verification is coNP-hard for a general class of input domains. Our results also exclude constant-factor polynomial-time approximations for the maximum of a function computed by a ReLU network. In this context, we also characterize surjectivity of functions computed by ReLU networks with one-dimensional output which turns out to be the complement of a basic network verification task. We reveal interesting connections to computational convexity by formulating the surjectivity problem as a zonotope containment problem</description>

      <title>The Probability Spaces of QuickSort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QuickSort and the analysis of its expected run time was presented 1962 in a classical paper by C.A.R Hoare. There the run time analysis hinges on a by now well known recurrence equation for the expected run time, which in turn was justified by referring to ``the law of conditional expectations''. A probability space for the runs of the algorithms was not constructed. Subsequent textbooks treated the recurrence relation as self evident and present it until this day without proof. Here we give an inductive definition of the probability space for the runs of randomized QuickSort and subsequently derive the recurrence equation with a not completely trivial proof.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on the Space Complexity of Circuit Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Williams (STOC 2025) recently proved that time-$t$ multitape Turing machines can be simulated using $O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ space using the Cook-Mertz (STOC 2024) tree evaluation procedure. As Williams notes, applying this result to fast algorithms for the circuit value problem implies an $O(\sqrt{s} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}\; s)$ space algorithm for evaluating size $s$ circuits.
  In this work, we provide a direct reduction from circuit value to tree evaluation without passing through Turing machines, simultaneously improving the bound to $O(\sqrt{s \log s})$ space and providing a proof with fewer abstraction layers.
  This result can be thought of as a "sibling" result to Williams' for circuit complexity instead of time; in particular, using the fact that time-$t$ Turing machines have size $O(t \log t)$ circuits, we can recover a slightly weakened version of Williams' result, simulating time-$t$ machines in space $O(\sqrt{t} \log t)$.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

      <title>An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\'ezout's theorem from algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic geometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem known as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), first studied by [Laumann, L\"auchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Among other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving not only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse, high-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is contained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also works in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>
