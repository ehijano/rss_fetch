      <title>Numerical and Physical Challenges to Nebular Spectroscopy in Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamical explosions of White Dwarfs (WD)are one of the keys to high precision cosmology. Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark. At some examples, we establish the power of high-precision nebular spectroscopy as quantitative tool. Centrally ignited, off-center delayed-detonation near Chandrasekhar-mass models can reproduce line-ratios and line profiles of Branch-normal and underluminous SNe Ia observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>Visual Language Models as Operator Agents in the Space Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as operator agents in the space domain, focusing on both software and hardware operational paradigms. Building on advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions, we investigate how VLMs can enhance autonomous control and decision-making in space missions. In the software context, we employ VLMs within the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) simulation environment, enabling the agent to interpret visual screenshots of the graphical user interface to perform complex orbital maneuvers. In the hardware context, we integrate VLMs with robotic systems equipped with cameras to inspect and diagnose physical space objects, such as satellites. Our results demonstrate that VLMs can effectively process visual and textual data to generate contextually appropriate actions, competing with traditional methods and non-multimodal LLMs in simulation tasks, and showing promise in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On the features of great Forbush effect during May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).</description>

      <title>Parallel Electric Fields And Electron Heating Observed In The Young Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.</description>

      <title>Evidence of potential thermospheric overcooling during the May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During intense geomagnetic storms, the rapid and significant production of NO followed by its associated infrared radiative emission in lower thermosphere contributes crucially to the energetics of the upper atmosphere. This makes NO infrared radiative cooling a very important phenomenon which needs to be considered for accurate density forecasting in thermosphere. This study reports the investigation of variations in thermospheric density, and NO radiative cooling during the recent geomagnetic superstorm of May 2024. A very rare post-storm thermospheric density depletion of about -23% on May 12 was observed by Swarm-C in northern hemisphere in comparison to the prestorm condition on May 9. This overcooling was observed despite the continuous enhancement in solar EUV (24-36 nm) flux throughout the event. The thermospheric NO infrared radiative emission in the recovery phase of the storm seems to be the plausible cause for this observed post-storm density depletion. The TIMED/SABER observed thermospheric density between 105 and 110 km altitude shows an enhancement during this thermospheric overcooling. Our analysis also suggests an all time high thermospheric NO radiative cooling flux up to 11.84 ergs/cm2/sec during May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm, which has also been compared with famous Halloween storms of October 2003.</description>

      <title>Mass supply from Io to Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the Voyager mission flybys in 1979, we have known the moon Io to be both volcanically active and the main source of plasma in the vast magnetosphere of Jupiter. Material lost from Io forms neutral clouds, the Io plasma torus and ultimately the extended plasma sheet. This material is supplied from Io's upper atmosphere and atmospheric loss is likely driven by plasma-interaction effects with possible contributions from thermal escape and photochemistry-driven escape. Direct volcanic escape is negligible. The supply of material to maintain the plasma torus has been estimated from various methods at roughly one ton per second. Most of the time the magnetospheric plasma environment of Io is stable on timescales from days to months. Similarly, Io's atmosphere was found to have a stable average density on the dayside, although it exhibits lateral and temporal variations. There is potential positive feedback in the Io torus supply: collisions of torus plasma with atmospheric neutrals are probably a significant loss process, which increases with torus density. The stability of the torus environment may be maintained by limiting mechanisms of either torus supply from Io or the loss from the torus by centrifugal interchange in the middle magnetosphere. Various observations suggest that occasionally the plasma torus undergoes major transient changes over a period of several weeks, apparently overcoming possible stabilizing mechanisms. Such events are commonly explained by some kind of change in volcanic activity that triggers a chain of reactions which modify the plasma torus state via a net change in supply of new mass. However, it remains unknown what kind of volcanic event (if any) can trigger events in torus and magnetosphere, whether Io's atmosphere undergoes a general change before or during such events, and what processes could enable such a change in the otherwise stable torus.</description>
