      <title>Reconstructing the orbit type stratification of a torus action from its equivariant cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate what information on the orbit type stratification of a torus action on a compact space is contained in its rational equivariant cohomology algebra. Regarding the (labelled) poset structure of the stratification we show that equivariant cohomology encodes the subposet of ramified elements. For equivariantly formal actions, we also examine what cohomological information of the stratification is encoded. In the smooth setting we show that under certain conditions -- which in particular hold for a compact orientable manifold with discrete fixed point set -- the equivariant cohomologies of the strata are encoded in the equivariant cohomology of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Homotopy cofinality for Non-Abelian homology of group diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01726v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a homotopy cofinal functor between small categories induces a weak equivalence between homotopy colimits of pointed simplicial sets. This is used to prove that the non-Abelian homology of a group diagram is isomorphic to the homology of its inverse image under a homotopy cofinal functor. This also made it possible to establish that the non-Abelian homology of group diagrams are invariant under the left Kan extension along virtual discrete cofibrations. With the help of these results, we have constructed a non-Abelian Gabriel-Zisman homology theory for simplicial sets with coefficients in group diagrams. Moreover, we have generalized this theory to presheaves over an arbitrary small category, which play the role of simplicial sets. Sufficient conditions are found for the isomorphism of non-Abelian homology of presheaves over a small category with coefficients in group diagrams. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology of the factorization category for the small category is isomorphic to the Baues-Wirsching homology. A condition is found under which a functor between small categories induces an isomorphism of non-Abelian Baues-Wirsching homology.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Spectral Properties of the Hodge Laplacian: Not All Small Eigenvalues Are Equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich spectral information of the graph Laplacian has been instrumental in graph theory, machine learning, and graph signal processing for applications such as graph classification, clustering, or eigenmode analysis. Recently, the Hodge Laplacian has come into focus as a generalisation of the ordinary Laplacian for higher-order graph models such as simplicial and cellular complexes. Akin to the traditional analysis of graph Laplacians, many authors analyse the smallest eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian, which are connected to important topological properties such as homology. However, small eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian can carry different information depending on whether they are related to curl or gradient eigenmodes, and thus may not be comparable. We therefore introduce the notion of persistent eigenvector similarity and provide a method to track individual harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors/-values through the so-called persistence filtration, leveraging the full information contained in the Hodge-Laplacian spectrum across all possible scales of a point cloud. Finally, we use our insights (a) to introduce a novel form of Hodge spectral clustering and (b) to classify edges and higher-order simplices based on their relationship to the smallest harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry and is generalised to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra, using a non-commutative analogue of a flat connection.</description>

      <title>A Quillen model structure of local homotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a closed model structure on the category of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded complexes of projective systems of ind-Banach spaces. When the base field is the fraction field $F$ of a complete discrete valuation ring $V$, the homotopy category of this model structure is the derived category of the quasi-abelian category $\overleftarrow{\mathsf{Ind}(\mathsf{Ban}_F)}$. This homotopy category is the appropriate target of the local and analytic cyclic homology theories for complete, torsionfree $V$-algebras and $\mathbb{F}$-algebras. When the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, the homotopy category is the target of local and analytic cyclic homology for pro-bornological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras, which includes the subcategory of pro-$C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial 2d higher topological quantum field theory from a local cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct combinatorial analogs of 2d higher topological quantum field theories. We consider triangulations as vertices of a certain CW complex $\Xi$. In the "flip theory," cells of $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ correspond to polygonal decompositions obtained by erasing the edges in a triangulation. These theories assign to a cobordism $\Sigma$ a cochain $Z$ on $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ constructed as a contraction of structure tensors of a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra $V$ assigned to polygons. The cyclic $A_\infty$ equations imply the closedness equation $(\delta+Q)Z=0$. In this context we define combinatorial BV operators and give examples with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the "secondary polytope theory," $\Xi_\mathrm{sp}$ is the secondary polytope (due to Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) and the cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra has to be replaced by an appropriate refinement that we call an $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra. We conjecture the existence of a good Pachner CW complex $\Xi$ for any cobordism, whose local combinatorics is descibed by secondary polytopes and the homotopy type is that of Zwiebach's moduli space of complex structures. Depending on this conjecture, one has an "ideal model" of combinatorial 2d HTQFT determined by a local $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra.</description>
