      <title>Efficient generation of realistic guided wave signals for reliability estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), accurate knowledge of the systems' reliability for detecting defects, such as Probability of Detection (POD) analysis is essential to enabling widespread adoption. Traditionally this relies on access to extensive experimental data to cover all critical areas of the parametric space, which becomes expensive, and heavily undermines the benefit such systems bring. In response to these challenges, reliability estimation based on numerical simulation emerges as a practical solution, offering enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, precise reliability estimation demands that the simulated data faithfully represents the real-world performance. In this context, a numerical framework tailored to generate realistic signals for reliability estimation purposes is presented here, focusing on the application of guided wave SHM for pipe monitoring. It specifically incorporates key characteristics of real signals: random noise and coherent noise caused by the imbalance in transducer performance within guided wave monitoring systems. The effectiveness of our proposed methodology is demonstrated through a comprehensive comparative analysis between simulation-generated signals and experimental signals both individually and statistically. Furthermore, to assess the reliability of a guided wave system in terms of the inspection range for pipe monitoring, a series of POD analyses using simulation-generated data were conducted. The comparison of POD curves derived from ideal and realistic simulation data underscores the necessity of considering coherent noise for accurate POD curve calculations. Moreover, the POD analysis based on realistic simulation-generated data provides a quantitative estimation of the inspection range with more details compared to the current industry practice.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $15,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>

      <title>Surface figure correction using differential deposition of WSi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface figure of an x-ray mirror was improved by differential deposition of WSi2 layers. DC magnetron sputtering through beam-defining apertures was applied on moving substrates to generate thin films with arbitrary longitudinal thickness variations. The required velocity profiles were calculated using a deconvolution algorithm. Height errors were evaluated after each correction iteration using offline visible light surface metrology. WSi2 was selected as a promising material since it conserves the initial substrate surface roughness and limits the film stress to acceptable levels. On a 300 mm long flat Si mirror the shape error was reduced to less than 0.2 nm RMS.</description>

      <title>Pixel data real time processing as a next step for HL-LHC upgrades and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experiments at LHC are implementing novel and challenging detector upgrades for the High Luminosity LHC, among which the tracking systems. This paper reports on performance studies, illustrated by an electron trigger, using a simplified pixel tracker. To achieve a real-time trigger (e.g. processing HL-LHC collision events at 40 MHz), simple algorithms are developed for reconstructing pixel-based tracks and track isolation, utilizing look-up tables based on pixel detector information. Significant gains in electron trigger performance are seen when pixel detector information is included. In particular, a rate reduction up to a factor of 20 is obtained with a signal selection efficiency of more than 95\% over the whole $\eta$ coverage of this detector. Furthermore, it reconstructs p-p collision points in the beam axis (z) direction, with a high precision of 20 $\mu$m resolution in the very central region ($|\eta| &lt; 0.8$), and, up to 380 $\mu$m in the forward region (2.7 $&lt; |\eta| &lt;$ 3.0). This study as well as the results can easily be adapted to the muon case and to the different tracking systems at LHC and other machines beyond the HL-LHC. The feasibility of such real-time processing of the pixel information is mainly constrained by the Level-1 trigger latency of the experiment. How this might be overcome by the Front-End ASIC design, new processors, and embedded Artificial Intelligence algorithms is briefly tackled as well.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter quantum sensing and magnetic communications with a hybrid dc and rf optically pumped magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM) that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude, spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz} in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation, reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than \SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards a RAG-based Summarization Agent for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity and sheer volume of information encompassing documents, papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.</description>
