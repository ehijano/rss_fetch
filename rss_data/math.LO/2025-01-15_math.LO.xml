      <title>Sundholm's theory of meaning explanation: logical atavism and the nature of proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I provide an overview of some of Sundholm's remarks on the history and philosophy of logic. In particular, I focus on Sundholm's proposal to explain meaning with no object-language/metalanguage distinction, and to provide a consequently contentual approach to formalisms for proofs. When applied to Gentzen's Natural Deduction in its two 1935 and 1936 variants, this triggers a reading of each variant as pointing to one of the poles in the distinction between proof-objects and proof-acts, also introduced by Sundholm. I suggest that the basis of this picture is given by a Martin-L\"ofian reading of the notion of analytic assertion.</description>

      <title>A nonsmooth path-connectedness relation in the real plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a compact subset of the real plane whose path-connectedness equivalence relation is Borel bireducible to a nonsmooth hyperfinite Borel equivalence relation. This answers a question of \cite{bec98}.</description>

      <title>Operators in the mind: Jan Lukasiewicz and Polish notation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1929 Jan Lukasiewicz used, apparently for the first time, his Polish notation to represent the operations of formal logic. This is a parenthesis-free notation, which also implies that logical functions are operators preceding the variables on which they act. In the 1980s, within the framework of research into mathematical models on the parallel processing of neural systems, a group of operators emerged -- neurally inspired and based on matrix algebra -- which computed logical operations automatically. These matrix operators reproduce the order of operators and variables of Polish notation. These logical matrices can also generate a three-valued logic with broad similarities to Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic. In this paper, a parallel is drawn between relevant formulas represented in Polish notation, and their counterparts in terms of neurally based matrix operators. Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic, shown in Polish notation has several points of contact with what matrices produce when they process uncertain truth vectors. This formal parallelism opens up scientific and philosophical perspectives that deserve to be further explored.</description>

      <title>Cut-free sequent calculi for the provability logic D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a Kripke model is a GL-model if the accessibility relation $\prec$ is transitive and converse well-founded. We say that a Kripke model is a D-model if it is obtained by attaching infinitely many worlds $t_1, t_2, \ldots$, and $t_\omega$ to a world $t_0$ of a GL-model so that $t_0 \succ t_1 \succ t_2 \succ \cdots \succ t_\omega$. A non-normal modal logic D, which was studied by Beklemishev (1999), is characterized as follows. A formula $\varphi$ is a theorem of D if and only if $\varphi$ is true at $t_\omega$ in any D-model. D is an intermediate logic between the provability logics GL and S. A Hilbert-style proof system for D is known, but there has been no sequent calculus. In this paper, we establish two sequent calculi for D, and show the cut-elimination theorem. We also introduce new Hilbert-style systems for D by interpreting the sequent calculi. Moreover, we show that D-models can be defined using an arbitrary limit ordinal as well as $\omega$. Finally, we show a general result as follows. Let $X$ and $X^+$ be arbitrary modal logics. If the relationship between semantics of $X$ and semantics of $X^+$ is equal to that of GL and D, then $X^+$ can be axiomatized based on $X$ in the same way as the new axiomatization of D based on GL.</description>

      <title>Relative differential closure in Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relative differential closure in the context of Hardy fields. Using our earlier work on algebraic differential equations over Hardy fields, this leads to a proof of a conjecture of Boshernitzan (1981): the intersection of all maximal analytic Hardy fields agrees with that of all maximal Hardy fields. We also generalize a key ingredient in the proof, and describe a cautionary example delineating the boundaries of its applicability.</description>

      <title>Models for common knowledge logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss models of the common knowledge logic. The common knowledge logic is a multi-modal logic that includes the modal operators $\mathsf{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a finite set of agents) and $\mathsf{C}$ in the language. The intended meanings of $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ are ''the agent $i$ knows $\phi$'' ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and ''$\phi$ is common knowledge among $\mathcal{I}$'', respectively. Semantically, this can be expressed as follows: $\mathsf{C}\phi$ is true if and only if all of $\phi$, $\mathsf{E}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{2}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{3}\phi,\ldots$ are true, where $\mathsf{E}\phi=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}}\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$. A Kripke frame that satisfies the condition is $\langle W,R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}} (i\in\mathcal{I}), R_{\mathsf{C}}\rangle$, where $R_{\mathsf{C}}$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of $R_{\mathsf{E}}=\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}}$. We refer to such Kripke frames as CKL-frames. An algebra that satisfies the condition is a modal algebra with modal operators $\mathrm{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and $\mathrm{C}$, which satisfies that $\mathrm{C} x\leq\mathrm{E}\mathrm{C} x$ and $\mathrm{C} x$ is the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$, where $\mathrm{E} x=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \mathrm{K}_{i} x$. We refer to such modal algebras as CKL-algebras. In this paper, we show that the class of CKL-frames is modally definable, whereas the class of CKL-algebras is not. That is, the class of CKL-algebras does not form a variety, and there exists a modal algebra in which the common knowledge logic is valid, but $\mathrm{C}x$ is not the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$.</description>
