      <title>Observation of Anti-helical Edge States in Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a hallmark of the quantum Hall effect, chiral edge modes (CEMs) counterpropagate along the two parallel edges of a ribbon structure. However, recent studies demonstrate counterintuitive antiCEMs that copropagate along the parallel edges. Analogous to the established extension of the CEMs to helical edge modes (HEMs) in the quantum spin Hall effect, it is natural to extend the antiCEMs to antiHEMs, which comprise a pair of time-reversal-related antiCEMs. In this Letter, we report the first observation of the antiHEMs based on a bilayer model that features staggered positive and negative interlayer hoppings. Experimentally, we implement this anti-helical model on an acoustic platform and provide compelling evidence for the antiHEMs by selectively exciting different spin subspaces, along with identifying the energybiased Dirac points in bulk spectra. Our findings may offer new insights into topological phases of matter and potentially pave the way for designing novel devices with unique edge transport properties.</description>

      <title>Observation and Control of Chiral Spin Frustration in BiYIG Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral interactions within magnetic layers stabilize the formation of noncollinear spin textures, which can be leveraged to design devices with tailored magnetization dynamics. Here, we introduce chiral spin frustration in which energetically degenerate magnetic states frustrate the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We demonstrate magnon-driven switching of the chirally frustrated spin states in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin films. These states are defined by an in-plane macrospin neighboring two out-ofplane spins on either side with opposing chirality. Using scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry and spin pumping, we identified four degenerate frustrated states and achieved their controllable switching via magnon spin torque. Crucially, the switching is unidirectional, with selectivity determined by the incoming magnon direction. This mechanism provides a powerful approach to manipulate frustrated spin states with magnons. Chiral spin frustration unlocks the geometry constraints of conventional frustration, and therefore opens new horizons for frustrated magnetism, paving the way for energy-efficient spintronic devices based on frustratio</description>

      <title>Probing Fermi surface topology by ultrafast pump pulse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical approach to detect changes in Fermi surface topology in a two-band model. Specifically, we show that the system's response to a low intensity light pulse can precisely identify topological Lifshitz transitions. At a suitable frequency, the light resonantly couples valence and conduction electrons, leading to an oscillation in the interband coherence term. This, in turn, generate a persistent oscillatory current which survives even after the end of the pulse. Notably, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory current during the pulse with that of the post-pulse reaches a minimum when the Fermi energy aligns with the saddle point, providing a robust framework for dynamically identifying Lifshitz transitions.</description>

      <title>{\Delta}SCF Excitation Energies Up a Ladder of Ground-State Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a widespread and effective tool in electronic structure calculations for ground-state electron systems. Its success has prompted exploration into the use of DFT for non-collective excited states. The delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) method allows for the extension of DFT to excited-state energies by restricting the Kohn-Sham orbital occupations, producing an excited-state electron density, and then computing its energy. In this paper, we examine the performance of the LSDA, PBE generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and SCAN/r2SCAN meta-GGA for the excitation energies of several important systems. We consider the energies of atoms with atomic number 1-18. For the hydrogen atom, where we use the exact electron density and have no multiplet splitting, we find significant improvement up the ladder from LSDA to PBE to SCAN. For the uniform gas, we find an effective mass different from the bare mass only with r2SCAN. We split the case of multi-electron atoms into non-aufbau excitations, where the highest-energy electron is excited to the lowest state in the next nl subshell (where accuracy is least limited by available basis sets), and spin-flip excitations, where the spin of an electorn is flipped, leading to a higher-energy state of the same nl configuration. We find reasonably accurate approximate excitation energies, except for the spin-flip cases where the auxiliary non-interacting wavefunction of a non-Hund's-rule spin state is not well-described by a single determinant.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of topological zero modes on a 41-qubit superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05341v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06565v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence Extracts Structure-Function Relationships from Plants for New Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Angular Momentum Generation in Thermally Driven Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence. Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals. Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted non-equilibrium topological physics.</description>

      <title>Spin Phonon Coupling and Relaxation time in Lu(II) compound with 9.2GHz clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.</description>

      <title>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</description>

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.</description>
