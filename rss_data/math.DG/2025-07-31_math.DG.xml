      <title>Isomorphism for the Holonomy Group of a K-Contact Sub-Riemannian Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holonomy group of the adapted connection on a K-contact Riemannian manifold $(M, \theta, g)$ is considered. It is proved that if the orbit space $M/\xi$ of the Reeb field $\xi$ action admits a manifold structure, then the holonomy group of the adapted connection on $M$ is isomorphic to the holonomy group of the Levi-Civita connection on the Riemannian manifold $(M/\xi, h)$, where $h$ is the induced Riemannian metric on $M/\xi$. Thanks to this result, a simple proof of the de Rham theorem for the case of K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds is obtained, stating that if the holonomy group of the adapted connection on $M$ is not irreducible, then the orbit space $M/\xi$ is locally a product of Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Isosystolic Inequalities for Holomorphic Chains in $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{holomorphic $k$-systole} of a Hermitian metric on $\mathbb{C}P^n$, defined as the infimum of areas of homologically non-trivial holomorphic $k$-chains. Our main result establishes that, within the set of Gauduchon metrics, the Fubini-Study metric locally minimizes the volume-normalized holomorphic $(n-1)$-systole. As an application, we construct Gauduchon metrics on $\mathbb{C}P^2$ arbitrarily close to the Fubini-Study metric whose homological $2$-systole is realized by non-holomorphic chains.</description>

      <title>A remark on equivariant Riemannian isometric embeddings preserving symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This remark pertains to isometric embeddings endowed with certain geometric properties. We study two embeddings problems for the universal cover $M$ of an $n$-dimensional Riemannian torus $(\TT^n,g)$. The first concerns the existence of an isometric embedding of $M$ into a bounded subset of some Euclidean space $\RR^{D_1}$, and the second one seeks an isometric embdding of $M$ that is equivariant with respect to the deck transformation group of covering map. By using a known trick in a novel way, our idea yields results with $D_1 = N+2n$ and $D_2 = N+n$, where $N$ is the Nash dimension of $\TT^n$. However, we doubt whether these bounds are optimal.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains some embedded minimal surface of genus 2.
  We also establish a theorem for more general 3-manifolds that relates the existence of genus $g$ minimal surfaces to topological properties regarding the set of all embedded singular surfaces of genus $\leq g$.</description>

      <title>A Born Structure on the Tangent Bundle of a Hessian Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hessian structure, introduced by Shima(1976), is a geometric structure consisting of a pair $(\nabla,g)$ of an affine connection $\nabla$ and a Riemannian metric $g$ satisfying certain conditions. On the other hand, the Born structure, introduced by Freidel et al.(2014), is a strictly stronger geometric structure than an almost (para-)Hermitian structure. Marotta and Szabo(2019) proved that for a given manifold endowed with a pair $(\nabla, g)$, one can introduce an almost Born structure on the tangent bundle. In this article, we study the equivalence between the conditions that the pair $(\nabla, g)$ defines a Hessian structure, and that the induced almost Born structure is integrable.</description>

      <title>Barycentric subspace analysis of network-valued data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain data are naturally modeled by networks or weighted graphs, be they arterial networks or mobility networks. When there is no canonical labeling of the nodes across the dataset, we talk about unlabeled networks. In this paper, we focus on the question of dimensionality reduction for this type of data. More specifically, we address the issue of interpreting the feature subspace constructed by dimensionality reduction methods. Most existing methods for network-valued data are derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and therefore rely on subspaces generated by a set of vectors, which we identify as a major limitation in terms of interpretability. Instead, we propose to implement the method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), which relies on subspaces generated by a set of points. In order to provide a computationally feasible framework for BSA, we introduce a novel embedding for unlabeled networks where we replace their usual representation by equivalence classes of isomorphic networks with that by equivalence classes of cospectral networks. We then illustrate BSA on simulated and real-world datasets, and compare it to tangent PCA.</description>

      <title>Universal embeddings of flag manifolds and rigidity phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a universal embedding theorem for flag manifolds: every flag manifold admits a holomorphic isometric embedding into an irreducible classical flag manifold. This result generalizes the classical celebrated embedding theorems of Takeuchi [30] and Nakagawa-Takagi [27]. Using this embedding, we establish new rigidity phenomena for holomorphic isometries between homogeneous K\"ahler manifolds. As a first immediate consequence we show the triviality of a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton submanifod of $C \times \Omega$, where $C$ is a flag manifold and $\Omega$ is a homogeneous bounded domain. Secondly, we show that no \emph{weak-relative} relationship can occur among the fundamental classes of homogeneous K\"ahler manifolds: flat spaces, flag manifolds, and homogeneous bounded domains. Two K\"ahler manifolds are said to be \emph{weak relatives} if they share, up to local isometry, a common K\"ahler submanifold of complex dimension at least two. Our main result precisely shows that if $E$ is (possibly indefinite) flat, $C$ is a flag manifold, and $\Omega$ is a homogeneous bounded domain, then: $E$ is not weak relative to $C\times\Omega$; $C$ is not weak relative to $E\times\Omega$; $\Omega$ is not weak relative to $E\times C$. This extends, in two independent directions, the rigidity theorem of Loi-Mossa [22]: we pass from \emph{relatives} to the more flexible notion of \emph{weak relatives} and dispense with the earlier ''special'' restriction on the flag-manifold factor. This result also unifies previous rigidity results from the literature, e.g., [5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 32].</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of open manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and universal cover Euclidean volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we will give an positive answer to Pan-Rong's conjecture that for an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, if its universal cover has Euclidean volume growth, then its fundamental group is finitely generated. Moreover the fundamental group is virtually abelian. The same result has been given by H.Huang-X.Huang for dimension 4. In fact, we will show the fundamental group finitely generated in a more general condition.</description>

      <title>On indefinite Einstein solvmanifolds admitting a Killing spinor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian Einstein solvmanifolds can be described in terms of nilsolitons, namely nilpotent Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant Ricci soliton metric. This characterization does not extend to indefinite metrics; nonetheless, nilsolitons can be defined and used to construct Einstein solvmanifolds of a higher dimension in any signature.
  An Einstein solvmanifold obtained by this construction turns out to satisfy the pseudo-Iwasawa condition, meaning that its Lie algebra splits as the orthogonal sum of a nilpotent ideal and an abelian subalgebra, the latter acting by symmetric derivations.
  We prove that the only pseudo-Iwasawa solvmanifolds that admit a Killing spinor, invariant or not, are the hyperbolic half-spaces.</description>

      <title>Spacetime inextensibility criteria by volume-distance-ratio asymptote and applications to naked singularities and FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i) $C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim t$. The key estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with the scale factor $t$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <title>Cheng's eigenvalue comparison on metric measure spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the localization technique, we prove a sharp upper bound on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of metric balls in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. This extends a celebrated result of Cheng to the non-smooth setting of metric measure spaces satisfying Ricci curvature lower bounds in a synthetic sense, via optimal transport. A rigidity statement is also provided for $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. We then present some mathematical and physical applications: in the former, we obtain an upper bound on the $j^{th}$ Neumann eigenvalue in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces and a bound on the essential spectrum in non-compact $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; in the latter, the eigenvalue bounds correspond to general upper bounds on the masses of the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations around general warped compactifications of higher-dimensional theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results with curvature conditions from Lichnerowicz Laplacian and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bochner technique is a classical tool in global differential geometry for proving vanishing and rigidity results by exploiting curvature conditions. Building on recent extensions of this method to complete non-compact settings by Petersen and Wink, we investigate $L^Q$-harmonic tensors with $Q&gt;1$ governed by the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on complete Riemannian manifolds. Our results generalize Bochner-type theorems to the non-compact realm, revealing new geometric rigidity phenomena not visible in compact cases. We establish vanishing theorems under integral curvature bounds and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities, and derive conditions under which harmonic tensors must vanish. In particular, we show that on Ricci-flat or Einstein manifolds, curvature tensors such as $\mathrm{Rm}$ or the Weyl tensor $W$ vanish identically under natural $L^Q$-integrability and positivity assumptions on the curvature operator. These results imply strong rigidity: flatness in the Ricci-flat case and constant sectional curvature in the Einstein case.
  We further apply our framework to closed hypersurfaces in space forms and derive vanishing results for intermediate Betti numbers under positivity conditions on the second fundamental form. Finally, we extend our theory to asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces, proving that harmonic Weyl tensors and Codazzi tensors must vanish under curvature positivity and decay conditions. Our analysis also links these results to ADM mass rigidity, establishing new obstructions to nontrivial decaying solutions on ALE 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian curvature identities of a $G_2$ connection with skew-symmetric torsion and generalized Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05619v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curvature properties of the characteristic connection on an integrable $G_2$ manifold are investigated. We consider integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type, i.e. the scalar product of the exterior derivative of the $G_2$ form with its Hodge dual is a constant. We show that on an integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type with $G_2$-instanton characteristic curvature and vanishing Ricci tensor the torsion 3-form is harmonic. Consequently, we prove that the characteristic curvature is symmetric in exchange the first and the second pair and Ricci flat if and only if the three-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita and to the characteristic connection simultaneously and this is equivalent to the condition that the characteristic curvature satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity. We find that the Hull connection is a $G_2$-instanton exactly when the torsion is closed. We observe that any compact integrable $G_2$ manifold with closed torsion is a generalized gradient Ricci soliton and this is equivalent to a certain vector field to be parallel with respect to the characteristic connection. In particular, this vector field is an infinitesimal automorphism of the $G_2$ structure and preserves the torsion three form.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that on compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with exterior derivative of the Lee form lying in the Lie algebra $spin(7)$ the curvature $R$ of the $Spin(7)$--torsion connection $R\in S^2\Lambda^2$ with vanishing Ricci tensor if and only if the $3$-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. It is also proved that $R$ satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity exactly when the $3$-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita and to the $Spin(7)$--torsion connections simultaneously.
  Precise conditions for a compact $Spin(7)$--manifold to has closed torsion are given in terms of the Ricci tensor of the $Spin(7)$--torsion connection. It is shown that a compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with closed torsion is Ricci flat if and only if either the norm of the torsion or the Riemannian scalar curvature is constant. It is proved that any compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with closed torsion 3-form is a generalized gradient Ricci soliton and this is equivalent to a certain vector field to be parallel with respect to the torsion connection. In particular, this vector field preserves the $Spin(7)$--structure.</description>

      <title>Injectivity radius lower bound of convex sum of tame Riemannian metrics and applications to symplectic topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the aspect of large-scale symplectic topology, we prove that for any pair $g_0, \, g_1$ of complete Riemannian metrics of bounded curvature and \emph{of injectivity radius bounded away from zero}, the convex sum $g_s: = (1-s ) g_0 + s g_1$ also has bounded curvature depending only on the curvature bounds $\|R_{g_i}\|_{C^0}$ of $g_0$ or $g_1$, and that the injectivity radii of $g_s$ have uniform lower bound depending only on the derivative bounds $\|R_{g_i}\|_{C^1} = \|R_{g_i}\|_{C^0} + \|DR_{g_i}\|_{C^0}$.
  A main technical ingredient to establish the injectivity radius lower bound is an application of the quantitative inverse function theorem. Using these estimates, we prove that each quasi-isometry class of tame metrics is convex and so contractible in strong $C^r$ topology for all finite regularity class of $3 \leq r &lt; \infty$. Using this Riemannian geometry result, we prove that the set of $C^3$-tame almost complex structures inside the same quasi-isometry class associated to the symplectic form $\omega$ is contractible.</description>

      <title>Non Hilbertian (Lorentzian) Length Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

      <title>Existence of 5 minimal tori in 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1989, B. White conjectured that every Riemannian 3-sphere has at least 5 embedded minimal tori. We confirm this conjecture for 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature. While our proof uses min-max theory, the underlying heuristics are largely inspired by mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal pseudosymmetries and B\"acklund transformations as $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how factorisation with respect to nonlocal pseudosymmetries allows one to obtain B\"acklund transformations, interpreted as nonlocal $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms of differential equations. According to this approach, which is illustrated through several examples, the B\"acklund transformations are determined by basic invariants of the exploited nonlocal pseudosymmetries.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and Schwarz Lemmas in Calibrated Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has two main objectives. First, for an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X,\phi)$, we define notions of $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity and $\phi$-hyperbolicity, which respectively generalize the notions of Kobayashi and Brody hyperbolicity from complex geometry. To make sense of the former, we introduce the "KR $\phi$-metric," a decreasing Finsler pseudo-metric that specializes to the Kobayashi-Royden pseudo-metric in the Kahler case. We prove that $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity implies $\phi$-hyperbolicity, and give examples showing that the converse fails in general. Moreover, for constant-coefficient, inner Mobius rigid calibrations $\phi$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we completely characterize those domains that are $\phi$-hyperbolic.
  Second, we derive a Schwarz lemma for Smith immersions (a.k.a. conformal $\phi$-curves) into an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X, \phi)$, thereby extending the Schwarz lemma for holomorphic curves into Kahler manifolds. The relevant Bochner formula features the "$\phi$-sectional curvature," a new notion that includes both the scalar and holomorphic sectional curvatures as special cases. As an application, we prove that calibrated geometries with $\phi$-sectional curvature bounded above by a negative constant are $R_\phi$-hyperbolic, generalizing the corresponding result from complex geometry. As another application, we calculate the KR $\phi$-metric of real, complex, and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces equipped with their natural calibrations.</description>

      <title>Surfaces in a strict Walker 3-manifold that contain non-null curves with zero torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-null curve $\gamma$ in a strict Walker 3-manifold, first we show that (locally) $\gamma$ lies in a flat cylinder with a null axis. Secondly, we construct an example of such a curve $\gamma$ and such a cylinder $S$ that contains $\gamma$ . In particular, the hypothesis that $S$ is totally geodesic has some consequence on the geometry of the ambient Walker 3-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space for constant sum Hessian curvature. More precisely, given a asymptotic boundary $\Gamma$, one seeks a complete hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ satisfying $\sigma_{n-1}(\kappa)+\alpha\sigma_{n}(\kappa)=\sigma\in (0,n),\,\,\partial \Sigma=\Gamma$ where $\alpha$ is a non-negative number.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based gradient descent methods for Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyak's Heavy Ball (PHB; Polyak, 1964), a.k.a. Classical Momentum, and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG; Nesterov, 1983) are well-established momentum-descent methods for optimization. Although the latter generally outperforms the former, primarily, generalizations of PHB-like methods to nonlinear spaces have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. In this paper, we propose a generalization of NAG-like methods for Lie group optimization. This generalization is based on the variational one-to-one correspondence between classical and accelerated momentum methods (Campos et al., 2023). We provide numerical experiments for chosen retractions on the group of rotations based on the Frobenius norm and the Rosenbrock function to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and that align with results of the Euclidean case, that is, a faster convergence rate for NAG.</description>
