      <title>Optical losses as a function of beam position on the mirrors in a 285-m suspended Fabry-Perot cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing optical losses is crucial for reducing quantum noise in gravitational-wave detectors. Losses are the main source of degradation of the squeezed vacuum. Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity is currently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Such filter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce the optimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularly detrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within the cavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noise reduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of the optical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of the Virgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses with respect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses depend clearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87 ppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61 ppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical error smaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different with respect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performed before the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major loss mechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The larger discrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination. In addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodology described in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position for which the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. This work can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for the optical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>PETAT -- An ASIC for Simple and Efficient Readout of Large PET Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern PET scanners based on scintillating crystals use solid state photo detectors for light readout. The small area of these devices is beneficial for spatial resolution, but also leads to a large number of electronic channels to be read out, mostly by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) containing amplification, noise reduction, hit finding, time stamping and amplitude measurement. Although each ASIC provides up to $\approx 64$ channels, a large number of chips is required with the need for auxiliary electronic components like voltage regulators or FPGAs for control and data readout. The FPGAs in turn often require multiple supply voltages and configuration infrastructure, so that PCBs get complicated, cumbersome and power-hungry, in addition to the significant power requirement of the front-end ASICs. We address this issue in the latest generation of our PETA readout ASIC for SiPMs by a simplified control scheme and, in particular, by a hierarchical serial data readout which does not require any additional FPGA. In addition, it provides a time-sorted stream of hit data, allowing early on-detector data reduction and hit pre-processing like the removal of hits with no coincident partner. The simplicity of this readout facilitates a supply scheme where power/ground of multiple ASICs are connected in series instead of the standard parallel connection. This 'serial-powering' approach can reduce supply current (while increasing overall supply voltage) so that voltage drop issues in the supply are alleviated.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>An Economical and Efficient Helium Recovery System for Vibration-Sensitive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design of a helium liquefaction system tailored to efficiently recover helium vapor from either an individual or a small cluster of vibration-sensitive cryogenic instruments. This design prioritizes a compact footprint, mitigating potential contamination sources such as gas bags and oil-lubricated compressors while maximizing the recovery rate by capturing both the boil-offs during normal operation and refilling process of the bath cryostat. We demonstrated its performance by applying it to a commercial low-temperature scanning probe microscope. It features a &gt; 94% recovery rate and induces negligible vibrational noise to the microscope. Due to its adaptability, affordability, compact size, and suitability for homemade setups, we foresee that our design can be utilized across a wide range of experimental measurements where liquid helium is used as the cryogen.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>
