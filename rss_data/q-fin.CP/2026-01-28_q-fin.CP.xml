      <title>Deep g-Pricing for CSI 300 Index Options with Volatility Trajectories and Market Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_\theta$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_\phi$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=\sigma_t X_t \nabla_x u_\theta$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_\theta(0,\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Predictive Accuracy versus Interpretability in Energy Markets: A Copula-Enhanced TVP-SVAR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether structural econometric models can rival machine learning in forecasting energy--macro dynamics while retaining causal interpretability. Using monthly data from 1999 to 2025, we develop a unified framework that integrates Time-Varying Parameter Structural VARs (TVP-SVAR) with advanced dependence structures, including DCC-GARCH, t-copulas, and mixed Clayton--Frank--Gumbel copulas. These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics. This synthesis offers a pathway where AI accuracy and economic interpretability jointly inform energy policy and risk management.</description>

      <title>Generating Alpha: A Hybrid AI-Driven Trading System Integrating Technical Analysis, Machine Learning and Financial Sentiment for Regime-Adaptive Equity Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate behavior patterns of financial markets are influenced by fundamental, technical, and psychological factors. During times of high volatility and regime shifts causes many traditional strategies like trend-following or mean-reversion to fail. This paper proposes a hybrid AI-based trading strategy that combines (1) trend-following and directional momentum capture via EMA and MACD, (2) detection of price normalization through mean-reversion using RSI and Bollinger Bands, (3) market psychological interpretation through sentiment analysis using FinBERT, (4) signal generation through machine learning using XGBoost and (5)dynamically adjusting exposure with market regime filtering based on volatility and return environments. The system achieved a final portfolio value of $235,492.83, yielding a return of 135.49% on initial investment over a period of 24 months. The hybrid model outperformed major benchmark indexes like S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ-100 over the same period showing strong flexibility and lower downside risk with superior profits validating the use of multi-modal AI in algorithmic trading.</description>

      <title>Design-Robust Event-Study Estimation under Staggered Adoption Diagnostics, Sensitivity, and Orthogonalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a design-first econometric framework for event-study and difference-in-differences estimands under staggered adoption with heterogeneous effects, emphasising (i) exact probability limits for conventional two-way fixed effects event-study regressions, (ii) computable design diagnostics that quantify contamination and negative-weight risk, and (iii) sensitivity-robust inference that remains uniformly valid under restricted violations of parallel trends. The approach is accompanied by orthogonal score constructions that reduce bias from high-dimensional nuisance estimation when conditioning on covariates. Theoretical results and Monte Carlo experiments jointly deliver a self-contained methodology paper suitable for finance and econometrics applications where timing variation is intrinsic to policy, regulation, and market-structure changes.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Circuit-Based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Trade Execution with Market and Limit Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework for optimal trade execution in a limit order book. We formulate the trade execution problem as a dynamic allocation task whose objective is the optimal placement of market and limit orders to maximize expected revenue. By modeling market and limit order allocations with multivariate logistic-normal distributions, the framework enables efficient training of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional benchmark strategies in simulated limit order book environments featuring noise traders submitting random orders, tactical traders responding to order book imbalances, and a strategic trader seeking to acquire or liquidate an asset position.</description>
