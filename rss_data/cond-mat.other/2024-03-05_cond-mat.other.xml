      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

      <title>A First-Principles Tool to Discover New Pyrometallurgical Refining Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the opportunities of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the development of new metallurgical refining processes. As such, a methodology based on DFT calculations is developed to discover new pyrometallurgical refining processes that use the addition of a third element to remove an impurity from a molten host material. As a case study, this methodology is applied to the refining of lead. The proposed method predicts the existing refining routes as well as alternative processes. The most interesting candidate for the removal of arsenic from lead is experimentally verified, which confirms the suitability of the remover element. The method is therefore considered as a useful approach to speed up the discovery of new pyrometallurgical refining processes, as it provides an ordered set of interesting candidate remover elements</description>

      <title>He-4 monolayer on Graphene: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical observation of non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computing experiment by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Full-frequency GW Calculations using a Lanczos Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GW approximation is widely used for reliable and accurate modeling of single-particle excitations. It also serves as a starting point for many theoretical methods, such as its use in the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and dynamical mean-field theory. However, full-frequency GW calculations for large systems with hundreds of atoms remain computationally challenging, even after years of efforts to reduce the prefactor and improve scaling. We propose a method that reformulates the correlation part of the GW self-energy as a resolvent of a Hermitian matrix, which can be efficiently and accurately computed using the standard Lanczos method. This method enables full-frequency GW calculations of material systems with a few hundred atoms on a single computing workstation. We further demonstrate the efficiency of the method by calculating the defect-state energies of silicon quantum dots with diameters up to 4 nm and nearly 2,000 silicon atoms using only 20 computational nodes.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic phases in Moire bilayers of magnetic dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magnetic insulators, the sense of rotation of the magnetization is associated with novel phases of matter and exotic transport phenomena. Aimed to find new sources of chiral magnetism rooted in intrinsic fields and geometry, twisted square bilayers of magnetic dipoles with easy plane anisotropy are studied. For no twist, each lattice settles in the zig-zag magnetic state and orders antiferromagnetically to the other layer. The moire patterns that result from the mutual rotation of the two square lattices influence such zig-zag order, giving rise to several phases that depict non-collinear magnetic textures with chiral motifs that break both time and inversion symmetry. For certain moire angles, helical and toroidal magnetic orders arise. Changing the vertical distance between layers can further manipulate these novel phases. It is shown that the dipolar interlayer interaction induces an emergent twist-dependent chiral magnetic field orthogonal to the direction of the zig-zag chains, which is responsible for the internal torques conjugated to the toroidal orders.</description>
