      <title>Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called "radiative" stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to $\gamma$-rays, including radio and $\gamma$-ray brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).</description>

      <title>The Gravity Collective: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Electromagnetic Search for the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW190425</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ultraviolet-to-infrared search for the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to GW190425, the second-ever binary neutron star (BNS) merger discovered by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK). GW190425 was more distant and had a larger localization area than GW170817, therefore we use a new tool teglon to redistribute the GW190425 localization probability in the context of galaxy catalogs within the final localization volume. We derive a 90th percentile area of 6,688 deg$^{2}$, a $\sim$1.5$\times$ improvement relative to the LIGO/Virgo map, and show how teglon provides an order of magnitude boost to the search efficiency of small ($\leq$1 deg$^{2}$) field-of-view instruments. We combine our data with all publicly reported imaging data, covering 9,078.59 deg$^2$ of unique area and 48.13% of the LIGO/Virgo-assigned localization probability, to calculate the most comprehensive kilonova, short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) afterglow, and model-independent constraints on the EM emission from a hypothetical counterpart to GW190425 to date under the assumption that no counterpart was found in these data. If the counterpart were similar to AT 2017gfo, there was a 28.4% chance that it would have been detected in the combined dataset. We are relatively insensitive to an on-axis sGRB, and rule out a generic transient with a similar peak luminosity and decline rate as AT 2017gfo to 30% confidence. Finally, across our new imaging and all publicly-reported data, we find 28 candidate optical counterparts that we cannot rule out as being associated with GW190425, finding that 4 such counterparts discovered within the localization volume and within 5 days of merger exhibit luminosities consistent with a kilonova.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Chandra and HST observations of the quiescent neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simultaneous Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope observations of three certain (X5, X7, W37) and two likely (X4, W17) quiescent neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We study these systems in the X-ray, optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) using the simultaneous data and additional non-contemporaneous HST data. We have discovered a blue and variable NUV counterpart to W17. We have not securely identified the eclipsing qLMXB W37 in the optical or NUV. Deeper high-resolution imaging is needed to further investigate the faint NUV excess near the centre of the W37 error circle. We suggest that a previously identified optical astrometric match to X7 is likely the true counterpart. The Halpha emission and the location of the counterpart in the colour-magnitude diagram, indicate that the secondary is probably a non-degenerate, H-rich star. This is consistent with previous results from fitting X7's X-ray spectrum. In X4, the simultaneous X-ray and optical behaviour supports the earlier suggestion that the X-ray variability is driven by changes in accretion rate. The X-ray eclipses in X5 coincide with minima in the optical/NUV light curves. Comparison of the 47 Tuc qLMXBs with the cataclysmic variables (CVs) in the cluster confirms that overall the qLMXBs have larger X-ray-to-optical flux ratios. Based on their optical/NUV colors, we conclude that the accretion disks in the qLMXBs are less prominent than in CVs. This makes the ratio of X-ray flux to excess blue optical flux a powerful discriminator between CVs and qLMXBs.</description>

      <title>A Hard Energy Spectrum in 3D Guide-Field Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection has long been known to be the most important mechanism not only for mixing the plasmas by changing the magnetic field topology but also for releasing the magnetic field energy into the plasma kinetic energy. During magnetic energy release, it is possible for some of the heated plasma to be accelerated to energies much higher than the thermal energy. Recently, the energy partitioning of the thermal and the nonthermal energy has been studied by using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and it has been shown that the acceleration efficiency of nonthermal particles increases with increasing the plasma temperature, and the nonthermal energy density occupies more than 90% in the total heated plasma when the Alfven velocity is close to the speed of light c. However, the acceleration efficiency decreases as the guide magnetic field increases. So far the acceleration efficiency has been mainly studied in two-dimensional systems, but it is interesting to study three-dimensional effects where the patchy and turbulent reconnection can dynamically occur. This study explores the effects of three-dimensional relativistic reconnection on a pair plasma with the guide magnetic field, utilizing three-dimensional (3D) PIC simulations. The results indicate that the decrease in nonthermal particle production is smaller in 3D guide-field reconnection compared to 2D. More importantly, contrary to general expectation, 3D reconnection is capable of maintaining a hard nonthermal energy spectrum even in the presence of a strong guide magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Parametric decay instability of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave in magnetically dominated plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection Techniques for CR Isotope Identification with the AMS-02 Experiment in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic composition measurements of singly charged cosmic rays (CR) provide essential insights into CR transport in the Galaxy. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) can identify singly charged isotopes up to about 10 GeV/n. However, their identification presents challenges due to the small abundance of CR deuterons compared to the proton background. In particular, a high accuracy for the velocity measured by a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is needed to achieve a good isotopic mass separation over a wide range of energies. The velocity measurement with the RICH is particularly challenging for $Z=1$ isotopes due to the low number of photons produced in the Cherenkov rings. This faint signal is easily disrupted by noisy hits leading to a misreconstruction of the particles' ring. Hence, an efficient background reduction process is needed to ensure the quality of the reconstructed Cherenkov rings and provide a correct measurement of the particles' velocity. Machine learning methods, particularly boosted decision trees, are well suited for this task, but their performance relies on the choice of the features needed for their training phase. While physics-driven feature selection methods based on the knowledge of the detector are often used, machine learning algorithms for automated feature selection can provide a helpful alternative that optimises the classification method's performance. We compare five algorithms for selecting the feature samples for RICH background reduction, achieving the best results with the Random Forest method. We also test its performance against the physics-driven selection method, obtaining better results.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting M = 2.4 in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ~10 keV until ~300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock-heating.</description>

      <title>Scattering Cross Sections of Magnetized Particles within Intense Electromagnetic Waves: Application to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Beloborodov suggested that there exists a resonance phenomenon between an extremely intense electromagnetic wave and internal magnetized particles. The particles exchange energy with the wave at frequent resonance events and then reach the radiation reaction limit immediately. This process greatly enhances the scattering cross section of the particles. Note that these results only involve an extraordinary (X) mode wave. In this paper, we focus on an intense ordinary (O) mode wave propagating through magnetized particles and compare it with the case of the X-mode wave. Our result shows that the scattering cross section of the particles in the O-mode wave is significantly smaller than that in the X-mode wave. This has important implications for the transparency of a fast radio burst (FRB) inside the magnetosphere of a magnetar. We argue that there is a strong scattering region in the stellar magnetosphere, within which an O-mode wave is more transparent than an X-mode wave for an FRB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the main results of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory one decade after the discovery of cosmic neutrinos. We emphasize the importance of multimessenger observations, most prominently for the discovery of neutrinos from our own Galaxy. We model the flux from the Galactic plane produced by Galactic cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium and discuss the perspectives of understanding the TeV-PeV emission of the Galactic plane by combining multimessenger observations. We draw attention to the interesting fact that the neutrino flux from the Galaxy is not a dominant feature of the neutrino sky, unlike the case in any other wavelength of light. Finally, we review the attempts to identify PeVatrons by confronting the neutrino and gamma-ray emission of Galactic sources, including those observed by LHAASO. We end with a discussion of searches for neutrinos from LHAASO's extragalactic transient source gamma-ray burst 221009A.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Galactic pulsars with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis work represents the first efforts to combine population synthesis studies of the Galactic isolated neutron stars with deep-learning techniques with the aim of better understanding neutron-star birth properties and evolution. In particular, we develop a flexible population-synthesis framework to model the dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars, their emission in radio and their detection with radio telescopes. We first study the feasibility of using deep neural networks to infer the dynamical properties at birth and then explore a simulation-based inference approach to predict the birth magnetic-field and spin-period distributions and the late-time magnetic-field decay for the observed radio pulsar population. Our results for the birth magneto-rotational properties agree with the findings of previous works while we constrain the late-time evolution of the magnetic field in neutron stars for the first time. Moreover, this thesis also studies possible scenarios to explain the puzzling nature of recently discovered periodic radio sources with very long periods of the order of thousands of seconds. In particular, by assuming a neutron-star origin, we study the spin-period evolution of a newborn neutron star interacting with a supernova fallback disk and find that the combination of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields and moderate accretion rates can lead to very large spin periods on timescales of ten thousands of years. Moreover, we perform population synthesis studies to assess the possibility for these sources to be either neutron stars or magnetic white dwarfs emitting coherently through magnetic dipolar losses. These discoveries have opened up a new perspective on the neutron-star population and have started to question our current understanding of how coherent radio emission is produced in pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Late-time Radio Flares in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio monitoring unveiled late (hundreds to a thousand days) radio flares in a significant fraction of tidal disruption events. We propose that these late-time radio flares are a natural outcome if the surrounding density profile flattens outside the Bondi radius. At the Bondi radius, the outflow is optically thin (above a few GHz) to synchrotron self-absorption. As more and more material is swept up, the radio emission rises asymptotically as $\propto t^3$ until the outflow begins to decelerate. A Detection of such a rise and a late-time maximum constrains the black hole mass and the mass and energy of the radio-emitting outflow. We show that this model can give reasonable fits to some observed light curves, leading to reasonable estimates of the black hole and outflow masses. We also find that the slope of the density profile within the Bondi radius determines whether an early-time ($\sim10^2\,\rm days$) radio peak exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

      <title>Abnormal threshold behaviors of photo-pion production off the proton in the GZK region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confirmation of the existence of GZK cut-off was tortuous, leading to activities to explore new physics, such as the cosmic-ray new components, unidentified cosmic-ray origins, unknown propagation mechanism, and the modification of fundamental physics concepts like the tiny Lorentz invariance violation (LV). The confirmation of the GZK cut-off provides an opportunity to constrain the LV effect. We use a phenomenological framework to restudy the GZK mechanism under the Planck scale deformation of the proton and pion dispersion relations. Restudying the photon induced pion production of the proton $\mathrm{p}+\gamma\to\mathrm{p}+\pi^0$, we predict abnormal threshold behaviors of this reaction under different LV modifications. Therefore, we can study the LV effects not only from the conventional GZK cut-off, but also from potentially threshold anomalies of the pion production process. We divide the LV parameter space into three regions, and analyze the constraints from current observations in each region. The current observations have set strict constraints on a certain LV region. However, for others LV regions, further experimental observations and theoretical researches are still needed, and we also find survival space for some theoretical explorations that permit specific LV effects.</description>

      <title>SPHINCS_BSSN: Numerical Relativity with Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe the {\em Lagrangian} numerical relativity code \sphi. This code evolves spacetimes in full General Relativity by integrating the BSSN equations on structured meshes with a simple dynamical mesh refinement strategy. The fluid is evolved by means of freely moving Lagrangian particles, that are evolved using a modern Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. To robustly and accurately capture shocks, our code uses artificial dissipation terms, but, similar to Finite Volume schemes, we apply a slope-limited reconstruction within the dissipative terms and we use in addition time-dependent dissipation parameters, so that dissipation is only applied where needed. The technically most complicated, but absolutely crucial part of the methodology, is the coupling between the particles and the mesh. For the mapping of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ from the particles to the mesh, we use a sophisticated combination of "Local Regression Estimate" (LRE) method and a "multi-dimensional optimal order detection" (MOOD) approach which we describe in some detail. The mapping of the metric quantities from the grid to the particles is achieved by a quintic Hermite interpolation. Apart from giving an introduction to our numerical methods, we demonstrate the accurate working of our code by presenting a set of representative relativistic hydrodynamics tests. We begin with a relativistic shock tube test, then compare the frequencies of a fully relativistic neutron star with reference values from the literature and, finally, we present full-blown merger simulations of irrotational binary systems, one case where a central remnant survives and another where a black hole forms, and of a binary where only one of the stars is rapidly spinning.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Number of Existing and Future Gravitational-Wave Detections from Merging Double Compact Objects</title>

Abstract: How many gravitational-wave observations from double compact object mergers have we seen to date? This seemingly simple question surprisingly yields a somewhat ambiguous answer that depends on the chosen data-analysis pipeline, detection threshold and other underlying assumptions. To illustrate this we provide visualizations of the number of existing detections from double compact object mergers by the end of the third observing run (O3) based on recent results from the literature. Additionally, we visualize the expected number of observations from future-generation detectors, highlighting the possibility of up to millions of detections per year by the time next-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online. We present a publicly available code that highlights the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave (astro)physics.</description>

      <title>Tracking the X-ray Polarization of the Black Hole Transient Swift J1727.8-1613 during a State Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an observational campaign on the bright black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 centered around five observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). These observations track for the first time the evolution of the X-ray polarization of a black hole X-ray binary across a hard to soft state transition. The 2--8 keV polarization degree decreased from $\sim$4\% to $\sim$3\% across the five observations, but the polarization angle remained oriented in the North-South direction throughout. Based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we find that the intrinsic 7.25 GHz radio polarization aligns with the X-ray polarization. Assuming the radio polarization aligns with the jet direction (which can be tested in the future with higher spatial resolution images of the jet), our results imply that the X-ray corona is extended in the disk plane, rather than along the jet axis, for the entire hard intermediate state. This in turn implies that the long ($\gtrsim$10 ms) soft lags that we measure with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) are dominated by processes other than pure light-crossing delays. Moreover, we find that the evolution of the soft lag amplitude with spectral state does not follow the trend seen for other sources, implying that Swift J1727.8$-$1613 is a member of a hitherto under-sampled sub-population.</description>

      <title>Revealing mysteries in gamma-ray bursts: the role of gluon condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a newly recognized gluon distribution in the nucleon, which was predicted by a QCD evolution equation to consistently explain several intriguing phenomena associated with gamma-ray bursts. They are the GeV-TeV spectra of GRB 221009A, the remarkably symmetrical explosion cloud in kilonova AT2017gfo, and the absence of a very high-energy gamma-ray signature in GRB 170817A. We find that these occurrences can be attributed to the gluon condensation within nucleons, i.e., a significant number of soft gluons within nucleons are condensed at a critical momentum, resulting in the emergence of a steep and high peak in the gluon distributions. Through this profound connection between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, we have not only expanded the applications of the hadronic scenario in cosmic gamma-ray emissions but also presented new evidence for the existence of gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey -- V. PSR J1901+0658 in a double neutron star system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems offer excellent opportunities to test gravity theories. We report the timing results of PSR J1901+0658, the first pulsar discovered in the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) Survey. Based on timing observations by FAST over 5 yr, we obtain the phase-coherent timing solutions and derive the precise measurements of its position, spin parameters, orbital parameters, and dispersion measure. It has a period of 75.7 ms, a period derivative of 2.169(6)$\times 10^{-19}$ s s$^{-1}$, and a characteristic age of 5.5 Gyr. This pulsar is in an orbit with a period of 14.45 d and an eccentricity of 0.366. One post-Keplerian parameter, periastron advance, has been well-measured as being 0.00531(9) deg yr$^{-1}$, from which the total mass of this system is derived to be 2.79(7) M$_{\odot}$. The pulsar has the mass upper limit of 1.68 M$_{\odot}$, so the lower limit for the companion mass is 1.11 M$_{\odot}$. Because PSR J1901+0658 is a partially recycled pulsar in an eccentric binary orbit with such a large companion mass, it should be in a DNS system according to the evolution history of the binary system.</description>

      <title>Return to the forgotten ULX: a broadband NICER+NuSTAR study of NGC 4190 ULX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed the nearby and relatively understudied ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 4190 ULX-1 jointly with NICER and NuSTAR to investigate its broadband spectrum, timing properties, and spectral variation over time. We found NGC 4190 ULX-1 to have a hard spectrum characterized by two thermal components (with temperatures ~0.25keV and ~1.6keV) and a high-energy excess typical of the ULX population, although the spectrum turns over at an unusually low energy. While no pulsations were detected, (with pulsed fraction 3-sigma upper limits of 16% for NICER and 35% for NuSTAR), the source shows significant stochastic variability and the covariance spectrum indicates the presence of a high-energy cut-off power-law component, potentially indicative of an accretion column. Additionally, when fitting archival XMM-Newton data with a similar model, we find that the luminosity-temperature evolution of the hot thermal component follows the behavior of a super-Eddington slim disk though the expected spectral broadening for such a disk is not seen, suggesting that the inner accretion disk may be truncated by a magnetic field. Therefore, despite the lack of detected pulsations, there is tantalizing evidence for NGC 4190 ULX-1 being a candidate neutron star accretor, although further broadband observations will be required to confirm this behavior.</description>

      <title>Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ Compact Object and a Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0~M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston Observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than $5~M_\odot$ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on U(1)' Models: from Non-Standard Interactions to Long-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of gauge bosons from a weakly coupled lepton flavor dependent $U(1)'$ interaction on the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos in the global analysis of oscillation data. The analysis is performed for interaction lengths ranging from the Sun-Earth distance to effective contact neutrino interactions. We survey $\sim 10000$ set of models characterized by the six relevant fermion $U(1)'$ charges and find that in all cases, constraints on the coupling and mass of the $Z'$ can be derived. We also find that about 5% of the $U(1)'$ model charges lead to a viable LMA-D solution but this is only possible in the contact interaction limit. We explicitly quantify the constraints for a variety of models including $U(1)_{B-3L_e}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{B-\frac{3}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{L_e-\frac{1}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$. We compare the constraints imposed by our oscillation analysis with the strongest bounds from fifth force searches, violation of equivalence principle as well as bounds from scattering experiments and white dwarf cooling. Our results show that generically, the oscillation analysis improves over the existing bounds from gravity tests for $Z'$ lighter than $\sim 10^{-8} \to 10^{-11}$ eV depending on the specific couplings. In the contact interaction limit, we find that for most models listed above there are values of $g'$ and $M_{Z'}$ for which the oscillation analysis provides constraints beyond those imposed by laboratory experiments. Finally we illustrate the range of $Z'$ and couplings leading to a viable LMA-D solution for two sets of models.</description>

      <title>The SN 2023ixf Progenitor in M101: II. Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive pre-explosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the SN, as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assume a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust-obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found median estimates of the star's effective temperature and luminosity of 2770 K and 9.0e4 L_Sun, with 68% credible intervals of 2340--3150 K and (7.5--10.9)e4 L_sun. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC -10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M_sun to as high as 14 M_sun. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the merger structure of black hole binaries in generic planar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise modeling of binary black hole coalescences in generic planar orbits is a crucial step to disentangle dynamical and isolated binary formation channels through gravitational-wave observations. The merger regime of such coalescences exhibits a significantly higher complexity compared to the quasicircular case, and cannot be readily described through standard parameterizations in terms of eccentricity and anomaly. In the spirit of the Effective One Body formalism, we build on the study of the test-mass limit, and introduce a new modelling strategy to describe the general-relativistic dynamics of two-body systems in generic orbits. This is achieved through gauge-invariant combinations of the binary energy and angular momentum, such as a dynamical "impact parameter" at merger. These variables reveal simple "quasi-universal" structures of the pivotal merger parameters, allowing to build an accurate analytical representation of generic (bounded and dynamically-bounded) orbital configurations. We demonstrate the validity of these analytical relations using 311 numerical simulations of bounded noncircular binaries with progenitors from the RIT and SXS catalogs, together with a custom dataset of dynamical captures generated using the Einstein Toolkit, and test-mass data in bound orbits. Our modeling strategy lays the foundations of accurate and complete waveform models for systems in arbitrary orbits, bolstering observational explorations of dynamical formation scenarios and the discovery of new classes of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Mass octupole and current quadrupole corrections to gravitational wave emission from close hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the next-to-leading order corrections in the mass multipole expansion, i.e. the mass octupole and current quadrupole, to gravitational wave production by close hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. We find that the signal is again, as in the simple quadrupole case, a burst event with the majority of the released energy occurring during the closest approach. In particular, we investigate the relative contribution to the power, both in the time and frequency domains, and total energy emitted by each order in the mass multipole expansion in gravitational waves. To do so, we include in the quadrupole term its first order post-Newtonian correction, giving this a contribution to the power of the same order as that of the mass octupole and the current quadrupole. We find specific configurations of systems where these corrections could be important and should be taken into account when analysing burst events.</description>

      <title>About gravitational radiation of semi local strings with non compact internal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work studies the gravitational radiation of a non abelian vortex with a non compact internal moduli describing its excitations. This situation may be realised by semi-local supersymmetric vortices \cite{novedad1}-\cite{reviewshifman}, although supersymmetry is not necessary for this to happen. In the situation considered along this work, the internal space has infinite volume, and a largely energetic perturbation propagates along the object, even though the vortex line may not be moving. A specific configuration is presented, in which the internal space is the resolved conifold with its Ricci flat metric. The curious feature about it is that it corresponds to a static vortex, that is, the perturbation is only due to the internal modes. Even being static, the emission of gravitational radiation is in the present case of considerable order. This suggest that the presence of slowly moving objects that can emit a large amount of gravitational radiation is a hint of non abelianity.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>
