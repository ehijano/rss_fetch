      <title>Opinion Dynamics Models for Sentiment Evolution in Weibo Blogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social media platforms enable influencers to distribute content and quickly capture audience reactions, significantly shaping their promotional strategies and advertising agreements. Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single "macro-agent", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.</description>

      <title>Advancing Equity in STEM: A Critical Analysis of NSF's Division for Equity and Excellence in STEM through Theoretical Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critically analyzes the National Science Foundation's Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM. While supporting its mission to broaden participation for underrepresented groups, the study finds current policies inadequate for dismantling systemic barriers. Using Critical Race Theory and Mills's Racial Contract, the analysis reveals how well-intentioned initiatives may reinforce racial hierarchies through commodification and exclusion. The research argues that diversity efforts focused on competitiveness often fail to affirm marginalized students' full personhood and intellectual capabilities. The paper concludes by advocating transformative reforms that move beyond access to fundamentally restructure STEM education environments, aligning NSF's practices with its equity and inclusion commitments.</description>

      <title>Importance Ranking in Complex Networks via Influence-aware Causal Node Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying node importance is a fundamental problem in network science and engineering, underpinning a wide range of applications such as influence maximization, social recommendation, and network dismantling. Prior research often relies on centrality measures or advanced graph embedding techniques using structural information, followed by downstream classification or regression tasks to identify critical nodes. However, these methods typically decouple node representation learning from the ranking objective and rely on the topological structure of target networks, leading to feature-task inconsistency and limited generalization across networks. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust, invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, we introduce an influence-aware causal node embedding module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and ranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows the proposed model to be trained on synthetic networks and to generalize effectively across diverse real-world networks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and cross-network transferability, offering new insights for network analysis and engineering applications-particularly in scenarios where the target network's structure is inaccessible in advance due to privacy or security constraints.</description>

      <title>Guided rewiring of social networks reduces polarization and accelerates collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global social and ecological challenges represent collective action problems requiring rapid and sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms. Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.</description>

      <title>Between Filters and Feeds: Investigating Douyin and WeChat's Influence on Chinese Adolescent Body Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat, two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed 395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.</description>

      <title>Sync or Sink: Bounds on Algorithmic Collective Action with Noise and Multiple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective action against algorithmic systems provides an opportunity for a small group of individuals to strategically manipulate their data to get specific outcomes, from classification to recommendation models. This effectiveness will invite more growth of this type of coordinated actions, both in the size and the number of distinct collectives. With a small group, however, coordination is key. Currently, there is no formal analysis of how coordination challenges within a collective can impact downstream outcomes, or how multiple collectives may affect each other's success. In this work, we aim to provide guarantees on the success of collective action in the presence of both coordination noise and multiple groups. Our insight is that data generated by either multiple collectives or by coordination noise can be viewed as originating from multiple data distributions. Using this framing, we derive bounds on the success of collective action. We conduct experiments to study the effects of noise on collective action. We find that sufficiently high levels of noise can reduce the success of collective action. In certain scenarios, large noise can sink a collective success rate from $100\%$ to just under $60\%$. We identify potential trade-offs between collective size and coordination noise; for example, a collective that is twice as big but with four times more noise experiencing worse outcomes than the smaller, more coordinated one. This work highlights the importance of understanding nuanced dynamics of strategic behavior in algorithmic systems.</description>
