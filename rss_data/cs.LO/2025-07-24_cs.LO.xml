      <title>Program Logics via Distributive Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive multiple program logics, including correctness, incorrectness, and relational Hoare logic, from the axioms of imperative categories: uniformly traced distributive copy-discard categories. We introduce an internal language for imperative multicategories, on top of which we derive combinators for an adaptation of Dijkstra's guarded command language. Rules of program logics are derived from this internal language.</description>

      <title>Resourceful Traces for Commuting Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, when the actions of a Mazurkiewicz trace are considered not merely as atomic (i.e., mere names) but transformations from a specified type of inputs to a specified type of outputs, we obtain a novel notion of presentation for effectful categories (also known as generalised Freyd categories), a well-known algebraic structure in the semantics of side-effecting computation. Like the usual representation of traces as graphs, our notion of presentation gives rise to a graphical calculus for effectful categories. We use our presentations to give a construction of the commuting tensor product of free effectful categories, capturing the combination of systems in which the actions of each must commute with one another, while still permitting exchange of resources</description>

      <title>Distributing Retractions, Weak Distributive Laws and Applications to Monads of Hyperspaces, Continuous Valuations and Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two monads $S$, $T$ on a category where idempotents split, and a weak distributive law between them, one can build a combined monad $U$. Making explicit what this monad $U$ is requires some effort. When we already have an idea what $U$ should be, we show how to recognize that $U$ is indeed the combined monad obtained from $S$ and $T$: it suffices to exhibit what we call a distributing retraction of $ST$ onto $U$. We show that distributing retractions and weak distributive laws are in one-to-one correspondence, in a 2-categorical setting. We give three applications, where $S$ is the Smyth, Hoare or Plotkin hyperspace monad, $T$ is a monad of continuous valuations, and $U$ is a monad of previsions or of forks, depending on the case. As a byproduct, this allows us to describe the algebras of monads of superlinear, resp. sublinear previsions. In the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the Plotkin hyperspace monad is sometimes known as the Vietoris monad, the monad of probability valuations coincides with the Radon monad, and we infer that the associated combined monad is the monad of normalized forks.</description>

      <title>Well-Founded Coalgebras Meet K\"onig's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K\"onig's lemma is a fundamental result about trees with countless applications in mathematics and computer science. In contrapositive form, it states that if a tree is finitely branching and well-founded (i.e. has no infinite paths), then it is finite. We present a coalgebraic version of K\"onig's lemma featuring two dimensions of generalization: from finitely branching trees to coalgebras for a finitary endofunctor H, and from the base category of sets to a locally finitely presentable category C, such as the category of posets, nominal sets, or convex sets. Our coalgebraic K\"onig's lemma states that, under mild assumptions on C and H, every well-founded coalgebra for H is the directed join of its well-founded subcoalgebras with finitely generated state space -- in particular, the category of well-founded coalgebras is locally presentable. As applications, we derive versions of K\"onig's lemma for graphs in a topos as well as for nominal and convex transition systems. Additionally, we show that the key construction underlying the proof gives rise to two simple constructions of the initial algebra (equivalently, the final recursive coalgebra) for the functor H: The initial algebra is both the colimit of all well-founded and of all recursive coalgebras with finitely presentable state space. Remarkably, this result holds even in settings where well-founded coalgebras form a proper subclass of recursive ones. The first construction of the initial algebra is entirely new, while for the second one our approach yields a short and transparent new correctness proof.</description>

      <title>Approximate SMT Counting Beyond Discrete Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning, solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches, like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modular inverse is an essential piece of computation required for elliptic curve operations used for digital signatures in Bitcoin and other applications. A novel approach to the extended Euclidean algorithm has been developed by Bernstein and Yang within the last few years and incorporated into the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin. However, novel algorithms introduce new risks of errors. To address this we have completed a computer verified proof of the correctness of (one of) libsecp256k1's modular inverse implementations with the Coq proof assistant using the Verifiable C's implementation of separation logic.</description>

      <title>Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power increases.</description>

      <title>Fagin's Theorem for Semiring Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantitative complexity over semirings has been intensively investigated. An important problem in this context is to connect computational complexity with logical expressiveness. In this paper we improve on the model of \emph{Semiring Turing Machines} (distinct from so called weighted Turing machines) introduced by Eiter \&amp; Kiesel (Semiring Reasoning Frameworks in AI and Their Computational Complexity, \emph{J. Artif. Intell. Res.}, 2023). Our central result is a Fagin-style theorem for a new quantitative complexity class using a suitable weighted logical formalism. We show that the quantitative complexity class that we call \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a commutative semiring, can be captured using a version of weighted existential second-order logic that allows for predicates interpreted as semiring-annotated relations. This result provides a precise logical characterization of the power series that form the class \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}. We also give the exact relation between Eiter \&amp; Kiesel's version of NP, called \NPoldinf{$\mathcal{R}$}, and the class \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}. Incidentally, we are able to recapture all the complexity results by Eiter \&amp; Kiesel (2023) in our new model, connecting a quantitative version of NP to various counting complexity classes.</description>

      <title>Learning Concepts Definable in First-Order Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</description>

Abstract: We present \texttt{muRelBench}, a framework for synthetic benchmarks for weakly-relational abstract domains and their operations. This extensible microbenchmarking framework enables researchers to experimentally evaluate proposed algorithms for numerical abstract domains, such as closure,least-upper bound, and forget, enabling them to quickly prototype and validate performance improvements before considering more intensive experimentation. Additionally, the framework provides mechanisms for checking correctness properties for each of the benchmarks to ensure correctness within the synthetic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Concurrent Reasoning in Outcome Logic: Independence, Conditioning, and Invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although randomization has long been used in distributed computing, formal methods for reasoning about probabilistic concurrent programs have lagged behind. No existing program logics can express specifications about the full distributions of outcomes resulting from programs that are both probabilistic and concurrent. To address this, we introduce Probabilistic Concurrent Outcome Logic (pcOL), which incorporates ideas from concurrent and probabilistic separation logics into Outcome Logic to introduce new compositional reasoning principles. At its core, pcOL reinterprets the rules of Concurrent Separation Logic in a setting where separation models probabilistic independence, so as to compositionally describe joint distributions over variables in concurrent threads. Reasoning about outcomes also proves crucial, as case analysis is often necessary to derive precise information about threads that rely on randomized shared state. We demonstrate pcOL on a variety of examples, including to prove almost sure termination for unbounded loops.</description>

      <title>On the role of connectivity in Linear Logic proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a property that extends the Danos-Regnier correctness criterion for linear logic proof-structures. The property applies to the correctness graphs of a proof-structure: it states that any such graph is acyclic and the number of its connected components is exactly one more than the number of nodes bottom or weakening. This is known to be necessary but not sufficient in multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) to recover a sequent calculus proof from a proof-structure. We present a geometric condition on untyped proof-structures allowing us to turn this necessary property into a sufficient one: we can thus isolate fragments of MELL for which this property is indeed a correctness criterion. In a suitable fragment of multiplicative linear logic with units, the criterion yields a characterization of the equivalence induced by permutations of rules in sequent calculus.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-Distance via L\'evy-Prokhorov Lifting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most studied and accepted pseudometric for probabilistic processes is one based on the Kantorovich distance between distributions. It comes with many theoretical and motivating results, in particular it is the fixpoint of a given functional and defines a functor on (complete) pseudometric spaces.
  Other notions of behavioural pseudometrics have also been proposed, one of them ($\epsilon$-distance) based on $\epsilon$-bisimulation. $\epsilon$-Distance has the advantages that it is intuitively easy to understand, it relates systems that are conceptually close (for example, an imperfect implementation is close to its specification), and it comes equipped with a natural notion of $\epsilon$-coupling. Finally, this distance is easy to compute.
  We show that $\epsilon$-distance is also the greatest fixpoint of a functional and provides a functor. The latter is obtained by replacing the Kantorovich distance in the lifting functor with the L\'evy-Prokhorov distance. In addition, we show that $\epsilon$-couplings and $\epsilon$-bisimulations have an appealing coalgebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</description>
