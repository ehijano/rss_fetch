      <title>Things we can learn by considering random locally symmetric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years various results about locally symmetric manifolds were proven using probabilistic approaches. One of the approaches is to consider random manifolds by associating a probability measure to the space of discrete subgroups of the isometry Lie group. The main goals are to prove results about deterministic groups and manifolds by considering appropriate measures. In this overview paper we describe several such results, observing the evolution process of the measures involved. Starting with a result whose proof considered finitely supported measures (more precisely, measures supported on finitely many conjugacy classes) and proceeding with results which were outcome of the successful and popular theory of IRS (invariant random subgroups). In the last couple of years the theory has expanded to SRS (stationary random subgroups) allowing to deal with a lot more problems and establish stronger results. In the last section we shall review a very recent (yet unpublished) result whose proof make use of random subgroups which are not even stationary.</description>

      <title>Generic stabilizers for simple algebraic groups acting on orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider faithful actions of simple algebraic groups on self-dual irreducible modules, and on the associated varieties of totally singular subspaces, under the assumption that the dimension of the group is at least as large as the dimension of the variety. We prove that in all but a finite list of cases, there is a dense open subset where the stabilizer of any point is conjugate to a fixed subgroup, called the generic stabilizer. We use these results to determine whether there exists a dense orbit. This in turn lets us complete the answer to the problem of determining all pairs of maximal connected subgroups of a classical group with a dense double coset.</description>

      <title>On finite permutation groups of rank three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of the finite primitive permutation groups of rank $3$ was completed in the 1980s and this landmark achievement has found a wide range of applications. In the general transitive setting, a classical result of Higman shows that every finite imprimitive rank $3$ permutation group $G$ has a unique non-trivial block system $\mathcal{B}$ and this provides a natural way to partition the analysis of these groups. Indeed, the induced permutation group $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is $2$-transitive and one can also show that the action induced on each block in $\mathcal{B}$ is also $2$-transitive (and so both induced groups are either affine or almost simple). In this paper, we make progress towards a classification of the rank $3$ imprimitive groups by studying the case where the induced action of $G$ on a block in $\mathcal{B}$ is of affine type. Our main theorem divides these rank $3$ groups into four classes, which are defined in terms of the kernel of the action of $G$ on $\mathcal{B}$. In particular, we completely determine the rank $3$ semiprimitive groups for which $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is almost simple, extending recent work of Baykalov, Devillers and Praeger. We also prove that if $G$ is rank $3$ semiprimitive and $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is affine, then $G$ has a regular normal subgroup which is a special $p$-group for some prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Fixers and derangements of finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>

      <title>The subgroup structure of pseudo-reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. We investigate the relationship between subgroups of a pseudo-reductive $k$-group $G$ and its maximal reductive quotient $G'$, with applications to the subgroup structure of $G$. Let $k'/k$ be the minimal field of definition for the geometric unipotent radical of $G$, and let $\pi':G_{k'} \to G'$ be the quotient map. We first characterise those smooth subgroups $H$ of $G$ for which $\pi'(H_{k'})=G'$. We next consider the following questions: given a subgroup $H'$ of $G'$, does there exist a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $\pi'(H_{k'})=H'$, and if $H'$ is smooth can we find such a $H$ that is smooth? We find sufficient conditions for a positive answer to these questions. In general there are various obstructions to the existence of such a subgroup $H$, which we illustrate with several examples. Finally, we apply these results to relate the maximal smooth subgroups of $G$ with those of $G'$.</description>
