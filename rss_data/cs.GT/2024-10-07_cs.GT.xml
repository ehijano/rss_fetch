      <title>Computing Most Equitable Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to design fair and (computationally) efficient voting rules is a central challenge in Computational Social Choice. In this paper, we aim at designing efficient algorithms for computing most equitable rules for large classes of preferences and decisions, which optimally satisfy two fundamental fairness/equity axioms: anonymity (every voter being treated equally) and neutrality (every alternative being treated equally). By revealing a natural connection to the graph isomorphism problem and leveraging recent breakthroughs by Babai [2019], we design quasipolynomial-time algorithms that compute most equitable rules with verifications, which also compute verifications about whether anonymity and neutrality are satisfied at the input profile. Further extending this approach, we propose the canonical-labeling tie-breaking, which runs in quasipolynomial-time and optimally breaks ties to preserve anonymity and neutrality. As for the complexity lower bound, we prove that even computing verifications for most equitable rules is GI-complete (i.e., as hard as the graph isomorphism problem), and sometimes GA-complete (i.e., as hard as the graph automorphism problem), for many commonly studied combinations of preferences and decisions. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first problems in computational social choice that are known to be complete in the class GI or GA.</description>

      <title>Multi-Attribute Auctions for Efficient Operation of Non-Cooperative Relaying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of a multi-attribute auction in a communication system to bring about efficient relaying in a non-cooperative setting. We consider a system where a source seeks to offload data to an access point (AP) while balancing both the timeliness and energy-efficiency of the transmission. A deep fade in the communication channel (due to, e.g., a line-of-sight blockage) makes direct communication costly, and the source may alternatively rely on non-cooperative UEs to act as relays. We propose a multi-attribute auction to select a UE and to determine the duration and power of the transmission, with payments to the UE taking the form of energy sent via wireless power transfer (WPT). The quality of the channel from a UE to the AP constitutes private information, and bids consist of a transmission time and transmission power. We show that under a second-preferred-offer auction, truthful bidding by all candidate UEs forms a Nash Equilibrium. However, this auction is not incentive compatible, and we present a modified auction in which truthful bidding is in fact a dominant strategy. Extensive numerical experimentation illustrates the efficacy of our approach, which we compare to a cooperative baseline. We demonstrate that with as few as two candidates, our improved mechanism leads to as much as a 76% reduction in energy consumption, and that with as few as three candidates, the transmission time decreases by as much as 55\%. Further, we see that as the number of candidates increases, the performance of our mechanism approaches that of the cooperative baseline. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of multi-attribute auctions to enhance the efficiency of data transfer in non-cooperative settings.</description>

      <title>Putting Gale &amp; Shapley to Work: Guaranteeing Stability Through Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-sided matching markets describe a large class of problems wherein participants from one side of the market must be matched to those from the other side according to their preferences. In many real-world applications (e.g. content matching or online labor markets), the knowledge about preferences may not be readily available and must be learned, i.e., one side of the market (aka agents) may not know their preferences over the other side (aka arms). Recent research on online settings has focused primarily on welfare optimization aspects (i.e. minimizing the overall regret) while paying little attention to the game-theoretic properties such as the stability of the final matching. In this paper, we exploit the structure of stable solutions to devise algorithms that improve the likelihood of finding stable solutions. We initiate the study of the sample complexity of finding a stable matching, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to reach a stable matching with high probability. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate intriguing tradeoffs between stability and optimality of the proposed algorithms, further complementing our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Energy Trading Mechanism Approaching Social Optimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private energy trading mechanism for prosumers in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, offering provable privacy guarantees while approaching the Nash equilibrium with nearly socially optimal efficiency. We first model the P2P energy trading as a (generalized) Nash game and prove the vulnerability of traditional distributed algorithms to privacy attacks through an adversarial inference model. To address this challenge, we develop a privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm incorporating carefully calibrated Laplacian noise. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-differential privacy while converging in expectation to the Nash equilibrium with a suitable stepsize. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithm's robustness against privacy attacks, convergence behavior, and optimality compared to the non-private solution. Results demonstrate that our mechanism effectively protects prosumers' sensitive information while maintaining near-optimal market outcomes, offering a practical approach for privacy-preserving coordination in P2P markets.</description>

      <title>Last Iterate Convergence in Monotone Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) is a framework utilized to model and approximate the behavior of a large number of agents, and the computation of equilibria in MFG has been a subject of interest. Despite the proposal of methods to approximate the equilibria, algorithms where the sequence of updated policy converges to equilibrium, specifically those exhibiting last-iterate convergence, have been limited. We propose the use of a simple, proximal-point-type algorithm to compute equilibria for MFGs. Subsequently, we provide the first last-iterate convergence guarantee under the Lasry--Lions-type monotonicity condition. We further employ the Mirror Descent algorithm for the regularized MFG to efficiently approximate the update rules of the proximal point method for MFGs. We demonstrate that the algorithm can approximate with an accuracy of $\varepsilon$ after $\mathcal{O}({\log(1/\varepsilon)})$ iterations. This research offers a tractable approach for large-scale and large-population games.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Overcome the Machine Penalty When Acting Fairly but Not When Acting Selfishly or Altruistically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social dilemmas where the collective and self-interests are at odds, people typically cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon termed the machine penalty. Overcoming this penalty is critical for successful human-machine collectives, yet current solutions often involve ethically-questionable tactics, like concealing machines' non-human nature. In this study, with 1,152 participants, we explore the possibility of closing this research question by using Large Language Models (LLMs), in scenarios where communication is possible between interacting parties. We design three types of LLMs: (i) Cooperative, aiming to assist its human associate; (ii) Selfish, focusing solely on maximizing its self-interest; and (iii) Fair, balancing its own and collective interest, while slightly prioritizing self-interest. Our findings reveal that, when interacting with humans, fair LLMs are able to induce cooperation levels comparable to those observed in human-human interactions, even when their non-human nature is fully disclosed. In contrast, selfish and cooperative LLMs fail to achieve this goal. Post-experiment analysis shows that all three types of LLMs succeed in forming mutual cooperation agreements with humans, yet only fair LLMs, which occasionally break their promises, are capable of instilling a perception among humans that cooperating with them is the social norm, and eliciting positive views on their trustworthiness, mindfulness, intelligence, and communication quality. Our findings suggest that for effective human-machine cooperation, bot manufacturers should avoid designing machines with mere rational decision-making or a sole focus on assisting humans. Instead, they should design machines capable of judiciously balancing their own interest and the interest of humans.</description>

      <title>Decoding Game: On Minimax Optimality of Heuristic Text Generation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding strategies play a pivotal role in text generation for modern language models, yet a puzzling gap divides theory and practice. Surprisingly, strategies that should intuitively be optimal, such as Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), often perform poorly in practice. Meanwhile, popular heuristic approaches like Top-$k$ and Nucleus sampling, which employ truncation and normalization of the conditional next-token probabilities, have achieved great empirical success but lack theoretical justifications. In this paper, we propose Decoding Game, a comprehensive theoretical framework which reimagines text generation as a two-player zero-sum game between Strategist, who seeks to produce text credible in the true distribution, and Nature, who distorts the true distribution adversarially. After discussing the decomposibility of multi-step generation, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form for one-step Decoding Game. It is shown that the adversarial Nature imposes an implicit regularization on likelihood maximization, and truncation-normalization methods are first-order approximations to the optimal strategy under this regularization. Additionally, by generalizing the objective and parameters of Decoding Game, near-optimal strategies encompass diverse methods such as greedy search, temperature scaling, and hybrids thereof. Numerical experiments are conducted to complement our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>pFedGame -- Decentralized Federated Learning using Game Theory in Dynamic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional federated learning frameworks suffer from several challenges including performance bottlenecks at the central aggregation server, data bias, poor model convergence, and exposure to model poisoning attacks, and limited trust in the centralized infrastructure. In the current paper, a novel game theory-based approach called pFedGame is proposed for decentralized federated learning, best suitable for temporally dynamic networks. The proposed algorithm works without any centralized server for aggregation and incorporates the problem of vanishing gradients and poor convergence over temporally dynamic topology among federated learning participants. The solution comprises two sequential steps in every federated learning round, for every participant. First, it selects suitable peers for collaboration in federated learning. Secondly, it executes a two-player constant sum cooperative game to reach convergence by applying an optimal federated learning aggregation strategy. Experiments performed to assess the performance of pFedGame in comparison to existing methods in decentralized federated learning have shown promising results with accuracy higher than 70% for heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>Admissibility Over Winning: A New Approach to Reactive Synthesis in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive synthesis is a framework for modeling and automatically synthesizing strategies in robotics, typically through computing a \emph{winning} strategy in a 2-player game between the robot and the environment. Winning strategies, however, do not always exist, even in some simple cases. In such situations, it is still desirable for the robot to attempt its task rather than "giving up". In this work, we explore the notion of admissibility to define strategies beyond winning, tailored specifically for robotic systems. We introduce an ordering of admissible strategies and define \emph{admissibly rational strategies}, which aim to be winning and cooperative when possible, and non-violating and hopeful when necessary. We present an efficient synthesis algorithm and demonstrate that admissibly rational strategies produce desirable behaviors through case studies.</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Support and Influencers in Social Media Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can individual agents coordinate their actions to achieve a shared objective in distributed systems? This challenge spans economic, technical, and sociological domains, each confronting scalability, heterogeneity, and conflicts between individual and collective goals. In economic markets, a common currency facilitates coordination, raising the question of whether such mechanisms can be applied in other contexts. This paper explores this idea within social media platforms, where social support (likes, shares, comments) acts as a currency that shapes content production and sharing. We investigate two key questions: (1) Can social support serve as an effective coordination tool, and (2) What role do influencers play in content creation and dissemination? Our formal analysis shows that social support can coordinate user actions similarly to money in economic markets. Influencers serve dual roles, aggregating content and acting as information proxies, guiding content producers in large markets. While imperfections in information lead to a "price of influence" and suboptimal outcomes, this price diminishes as markets grow, improving social welfare. These insights provide a framework for understanding coordination in distributed environments, with applications in both sociological systems and multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Shuffling Gradient Descent-Ascent with Variance Reduction for Nonconvex-Strongly Concave Smooth Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in designing stochastic first-order algorithms to tackle finite-sum smooth minimax problems. To obtain the gradient estimates, one typically relies on the uniform sampling-with-replacement scheme or various sampling-without-replacement (also known as shuffling) schemes. While the former is easier to analyze, the latter often have better empirical performance. In this paper, we propose a novel single-loop stochastic gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm that employs both shuffling schemes and variance reduction to solve nonconvex-strongly concave smooth minimax problems. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-stationarity in expectation in $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2 \epsilon^{-2})$ iterations, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the problem. This outperforms existing shuffling schemes and matches the complexity of the best-known sampling-with-replacement algorithms. Our proposed algorithm also achieves the same complexity as that of its deterministic counterpart, the two-timescale GDA algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Double Oracle Neural Architecture Search for Game Theoretic Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to train deep learning models using game theory concepts including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Adversarial Training (AT) where we deploy a double-oracle framework using best response oracles. GAN is essentially a two-player zero-sum game between the generator and the discriminator. The same concept can be applied to AT with attacker and classifier as players. Training these models is challenging as a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist and even finding the mixed Nash equilibrium is difficult as training algorithms for both GAN and AT have a large-scale strategy space. Extending our preliminary model DO-GAN, we propose the methods to apply the double oracle framework concept to Adversarial Neural Architecture Search (NAS for GAN) and Adversarial Training (NAS for AT) algorithms. We first generalize the players' strategies as the trained models of generator and discriminator from the best response oracles. We then compute the meta-strategies using a linear program. For scalability of the framework where multiple network models of best responses are stored in the memory, we prune the weakly-dominated players' strategies to keep the oracles from becoming intractable. Finally, we conduct experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet for DONAS-GAN. We also evaluate the robustness under FGSM and PGD attacks on CIFAR-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet for DONAS-AT. We show that all our variants have significant improvements in both subjective qualitative evaluation and quantitative metrics, compared with their respective base architectures.</description>

      <title>Contest design with a finite type-space: A unifying approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical contest design problem of allocating a budget across different prizes to maximize effort in a finite type-space environment. For any contest, we characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium. In this equilibrium, different agent types mix over contiguous intervals so that more efficient agents always exert greater effort than less efficient agents. We then solve for the expected equilibrium effort, and identify conditions under which the effect of increasing competition under linear costs is informative about the effect of such a transformation under general costs. As a result, we find that the winner-takes-all contest is optimal under linear and concave costs. Lastly, we obtain an equilibrium convergence result for the continuum type-space, and since the finite type-space encompasses the complete information environment as a special case, our analysis offers a unified approach to studying contests in these classical environments.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>GLEE: A Unified Framework and Benchmark for Language-based Economic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? Can they mimic human behavior? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in the strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. While the ML community has been exploring the potential of LLMs in such multi-agent setups, varying assumptions, design choices and evaluation criteria across studies make it difficult to draw robust and meaningful conclusions. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents to human players in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents.</description>

      <title>Controlling Delegations in Liquid Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In liquid democracy, agents can either vote directly or delegate their vote to a different agent of their choice. This results in a power structure in which certain agents possess more voting weight than others. As a result, it opens up certain possibilities of vote manipulation, including control and bribery, that do not exist in standard voting scenarios of direct democracy. Here we formalize a certain kind of election control -- in which an external agent may change certain delegation arcs -- and study the computational complexity of the corresponding combinatorial problem.</description>

      <title>Principal-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Orchestrating AI Agents with Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of AI is shaping the future landscape of the internet, which is set to become an integrated ecosystem of AI agents. Orchestrating the interaction among AI agents necessitates decentralized, self-sustaining mechanisms that harmonize the tension between individual interests and social welfare. In this paper we tackle this challenge by synergizing reinforcement learning with principal-agent theory from economics. Taken separately, the former allows unrealistic freedom of intervention, while the latter struggles to scale in sequential settings. Combining them achieves the best of both worlds. We propose a framework where a principal guides an agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using a series of contracts, which specify payments by the principal based on observable outcomes of the agent's actions. We present and analyze a meta-algorithm that iteratively optimizes the policies of the principal and agent, showing its equivalence to a contraction operator on the principal's Q-function, and its convergence to subgame-perfect equilibrium. We then scale our algorithm with deep Q-learning and analyze its convergence in the presence of approximation error, both theoretically and through experiments with randomly generated binary game-trees. Extending our framework to multiple agents, we apply our methodology to the combinatorial Coin Game. Addressing this multi-agent sequential social dilemma is a promising first step toward scaling our approach to more complex, real-world instances.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time--Branching-Time Spectroscopy Accounting for Silent Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first generalized game characterization of van Glabbeek's linear-time--branching-time spectrum with silent steps. Thereby, one multi-dimensional energy game can be used to characterize and decide a wide array of weak behavioral equivalences between stability-respecting branching bisimilarity and weak trace equivalence in one go. To establish correctness, we relate attacker-winning energy budgets and distinguishing sublanguages of Hennessy--Milner logic that we characterize by eight dimensions of formula expressiveness.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>
