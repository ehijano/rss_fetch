      <title>Enabling searches for long-lived particles at a future 10 TeV Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon Colliders offer fantastic opportunities to explore new phenomena at the energy frontier. However, beam-induced-backgrounds from muon decays pose significant challenges for detector design, readout, and reconstruction. Previous detector studies have employed stringent hit-timing requirements to reduce occupancy to manageable levels with negligible efficiency loss for prompt Standard Model particles. In the spirit of maximizing discovery potential, we investigate the capability of detecting meta-stable charged long-lived particles at a 10 TeV Muon Collider. As a benchmark, we consider a Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) model in which the stau is long-lived and can be identified as a high momentum, slowly moving track. We find that nominal hit-timing selections are too restrictive, and investigate the impact of looser requirements. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover sensitivity to particles with masses close to $\sqrt{s}/2$ by expanding time acceptance, and provide recommendations to further improve tracker design and track reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Modeling Light Signals Using Data from the First Pulsed Neutron Source Program at the DUNE Vertical Drift ColdBox Test Facility at CERN Neutrino Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a first quantitative test of detected light signals produced in a pulsed neutron source run in a small vertical drift LArTPC at the CERN neutrino platform ColdBox test facility. The ColdBox cryostat, detectors, neutron sources, and particle interactions are modeled and simulated using Fluka. A good agreement is found in the detected number of photoelectrons, with values below 650 photoelectrons in both data and simulation, for all four X-ARAPUCA photodetectors on the cathode in the LArTPC. A time constant is also fitted from the neutron-beam-off light signal spectrum and found consistent between data and MC. Several important systematic effects are discussed and serve as guides for future runs at larger LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>Deep sets and event-level maximum-likelihood estimation for fast pile-up jet rejection in ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple proton-proton collisions (pile-up) occur at every bunch crossing at the LHC, with the mean number of interactions expected to reach 80 during Run 3 and up to 200 at the High-Luminosity LHC. As a direct consequence, events with multijet signatures will occur at increasingly high rates. To cope with the increased luminosity, being able to efficiently group jets according to their origin along the beamline is crucial, particularly at the trigger level. In this work, a novel uncertainty-aware jet regression model based on a Deep Sets architecture is introduced, DIPz, to regress on a jet origin position along the beamline. The inputs to the DIPz algorithm are the charged particle tracks associated to each jet. An event-level discriminant, the Maximum Log Product of Likelihoods (MLPL), is constructed by combining the DIPz per-jet predictions. MLPL is cut-optimized to select events compatible with targeted multi-jet signature selection. This combined approach provides a robust and computationally efficient method for pile-up rejection in multi-jet final states, applicable to real-time event selections at the ATLAS High Level Trigger.</description>

      <title>The Four Polarizations of the $W$ at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate polarization-induced interference and off-shell effects in predictions for high-energy, multi-leg processes with intermediate weak bosons carrying fixed helicities. Building on the ``truncated propagator'' paradigm, we carry out our analysis at the level of helicity amplitudes and squared amplitudes. We introduce bookkeeping devices, suitable for covariant and axial gauge choices, that simplify the analytical evaluation of polarized amplitudes, and make power counting of mass-over-energy factors more manifest. Among other results, we show that polarization interference (i) is generally non-zero, even in on-shell limits, (ii) can be negative and comparable to longitudinal contributions, and (iii) is generated by helicity inversion and therefore suppressed (or zero) in high-energy limits for $s$- and $t$-channel exchanges. Connections between gauge invariance and the scalar polarization are also discussed, as is a scheme for reducing gauge dependence in predictions for polarized scattering rates. As case studies, we consider charged-current processes, including $W$(+jets), top quark decay, and neutrino deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: radius effects in the angular substructure of heavy-ion jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure observables serve as essential tools for probing the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and $E$-scheme axes $\langle \phi \rangle$, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as $(R_L/R)^4$, whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as $(R_L/R)^2$ and $(R_L/R)^4$. Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the $\langle \phi \rangle$ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators.</description>

      <title>Potential for the discovery of the protophobic boson at the STCF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the morphology of the main drift chamber (MDC) proposed to be built around the collision point at the upcoming Super tau-charm facility (STCF), to check for its suitability in discovering the 17 MeV protophobic boson (X17 boson), hypothesised as a solution to the persistent ATOMKI nuclear-transition anomalies. These anomalies, observed in the excited $^8$Be, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclear transitions, have been interpreted as evidence for a $\sim$17 MeV, protophobic vector boson. Using the TrackEff framework, we perform detector-level simulations of the STCF MDC, and evaluate displaced-vertex sensitivities towards the protophobic boson, across the relevant mass-coupling parameter space. We study benchmark scenarios with visible and dark decay channels to perform likelihood-based significance estimates in order to determine the 5$\sigma$ discovery reach for the protophobic boson. We find that STCF can discover the protophobic boson while tolerating $\sim 10^4$ background events for specific regions of the parameter space around the 17 MeV peak. Our analysis establishes the first feasibility study of displaced light-boson searches at the STCF, motivating a full Geant-4 simulation.</description>

      <title>Towards the Direct Detection of Composite Ultraheavy Dark Matter in Quantum Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensor arrays have recently been proposed as a promising platform for the direct detection of ultraheavy dark matter, which is typically assumed to behave as a point-like particle. However, particles with masses at or above the Planck scale cannot be elementary; instead, they must exist as composite objects with finite spatial extent. Such spatially extended dark matter models lead to distinctive phenomenology in these detectors, particularly when the dark matter also interacts through long-range forces with their own characteristic length scales. In this work, we study the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays to composite, ultraheavy dark matter interacting via both gravity and a novel Yukawa force. We consider three phenomenologically motivated density profiles -- a tophat, a Gaussian, and an exponential -- and contrast their signals with the point-like limit. Using a Monte Carlo analysis based on the predicted impulse signals and estimates of thermal and quantum noise, we obtain sensitivity projections for a future realization of a quantum sensor array. We find a non-trivial interplay between the dark-matter scale radius, the inter-sensor spacing, and the Yukawa screening length. Future accelerometer arrays would provide valuable information about the mass and size of composite ultraheavy dark matter, and our work will help to characterize the signatures of different theoretical models of ultraheavy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Security for Private Networks: Real-World Evaluation of WireGuard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores WireGuard as a lightweight alternative to IPsec for securing the user plane as well as the control plane in an industrial Open RAN deployment at the Adtran Terafactory in Meiningen. We focus on a realistic scenario where external vendors access their hardware in our 5G factory network, posing recurrent security risks from untrusted gNBs and intermediate network elements. Unlike prior studies limited to lab setups, we implement a complete proof-of-concept in a factory environment and compare WireGuard with IPsec under industrial traffic conditions. Our approach successfully protects user data (N3 interface) against untrusted gNBs and man-in-the-middle attacks while enabling control plane (N2 interface) authentication between the access and mobility management functions (AMF) and gNB. Performance measurements show that WireGuard adds minimal overhead in throughput, latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage, achieving performance comparable to IPsec. These findings demonstrate that WireGuard offers competitive performance with significantly reduced configuration complexity, making it a strong candidate for broader adoption in O-RAN, providing a unified, lightweight security layer across multiple interfaces and components.</description>

      <title>Hadronic contributions to $a_\mu$ within Resonance Chiral Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the recent progress achieved, using Resonance Chiral Theory, in the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. These include the hadronic vacuum polarization, either using $e^+e^-$ or $\tau$ decays into hadron final states as input; and the hadronic light-by-light part, where in addition to previous results on the lightest pseudoscalar and tensor-poles contributions, we first present the evaluation of the pseudoscalar box using this formalism. We also discuss the scalar, axial-pole and other subleading pieces. The results obtained are consistent with the White Paper 2 values, with comparable precision.</description>

      <title>A unified approach for the hadronic weak decays of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{\pm}\to N\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified approach for the two-body hadronic weak decays of hyperons with $S=-1$, i.e. $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^\pm$, in the framework of the non-relativistic constitute quark model (NRCQM). A combined analysis shows that the branching ratios and asymmetry parameters of the decay channels $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^\pm\to N\pi$ can be well described in the same framework with the direct pion emission, color suppressed internal $W$ emission, and pole terms included. However, the channel $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ indicates significant deviations from the experimental data based on these mentioned transition mechanism. We demonstrate that the final state interactions (FSIs) via the coupled-channel rescatterings play a crucial role in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$. Namely, the dominant decay channel of $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ can contribute to $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ via the $p\pi^-\to n\pi^0$ rescatterings. This is a leading correction effect for $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ at the one-loop level. We find that such FSIs only become the leading effects in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$, but contribute as subleading contributions in other channels. We also demonstrate that the pole terms are indispensable in these hyperon decays. In particular, for $\Sigma^-\to n\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^+\to n\pi^+$, it shows that $\Lambda(1405)$ as the intermediate state in the pole term amplitude is necessary for reproducing the experimental data. We also find that a dynamic selection rule forbids the radial excitation state $N(1710)$ of the quark model multiplet $|70, ^28,2,0^+,1/2^+\rangle$ from contribution. To some extent, the hyperon hadronic weak decays serve as a special probe for the underlying transition mechanisms and can provide some constraints on the intermediate $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryon resonances.</description>

      <title>Three-body resonances of $\alpha\alpha M$ clusters ($M=\phi$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c$) in $^{9}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently obtained HAL QCD potentials for the $N$-$\phi$, $N$-$J/\psi$, and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions. interactions, we investigate the structure of the exotic nuclei $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}$, $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$, and $^{9}_{\eta_c}{\mathrm{Be}}$ as $\alpha+\alpha+M$ three-body systems ($M$ denotes the meson). The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $\alpha\phi$ and $\alpha$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $\phi$ meson exhibits a strong "glue-like" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $\alpha$-$J/\psi$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $\alpha$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems.</description>

Abstract: We present disperon QED, a method to deal with data input in loop processes in Monte Carlo codes. It relies on dispersion relations, automated tools such as OpenLoops, effective field theory methods and a threshold subtraction. We motivate this method and apply it to the process $ee\to\pi\pi$ in McMule to deal with hadronic vacuum polarisation insertions in two-loop contributions as well as the vector form factor of the pion within the form-factor scalar QED approximation. The generality of this method for more complicated processes is emphasised.</description>

      <title>Approximate N$^2$LO and N$^3$LO QCD Predictions for $tW$ Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a calculation of approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^2$LO) and next-to-N$^2$LO (N$^3$LO) QCD corrections to associated $tW$ production at the LHC, which constitute the dominant contributions to full perturbative predictions. The approximate N$^2$LO corrections consist of the large logarithmic terms $\ln^n (1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ (with $\sqrt{\hat{s}}$ being the partonic center-of-mass energy and $Q$ the invariant mass of the $tW$ system) and the terms proportional to $\delta(1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, which are obtained by utilizing the newly obtained two-loop hard and soft functions. The approximate N$^3$LO corrections further include the large logarithms at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ by using renormalization group evolution equations and the three-loop soft anomalous dimension, while the $\delta(1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ term is only partially accurate at this order. Numerical evaluation reveals that they increase the NLO cross section by more than $10\%$. The inclusion of these higher-order corrections leads to improved agreement with the experimental data at the LHC, resulting in a direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{tb}|=0.99\pm 0.03({\rm exp.})\pm 0.03({\rm theo.})$ without assuming unitarity of the matrix.</description>

Abstract: I review recent results on phase structure and equation of state of strong interaction matter from lattice QCD. Particular emphasis is given to the axes where direct simulations are possible and results are obtained with sufficient control over systematic effects. I also discuss the status of approaching the region of non-zero baryochemical potentials using indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Measurements Using Charge and Light Readout in a Pixelated Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers have emerged as a competitive technology for detecting solar neutrinos. The SoLAr collaboration was formed to explore argon detectors with pixelated light and charge readout, aiming for high detection efficiency and improved energy resolution. Building on the success of an initial prototype, we present results obtained with a second SoLAr prototype (V2), a $30 \times 30 \times 30$ cm$^{3}$ time projection chamber operated in a cryostat containing several hundred kilograms of liquid argon. We report measurements of cosmic-ray muons using both tracking and calorimetry from light and charge sensors, and we highlight the improved performance achieved through combined charge and light reconstruction. These results demonstrate the promise of dual-readout detectors and motivate future prototyping efforts toward kiloton-scale facilities.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Benchmarks for $D^0\to K^- K^+, \pi^-\pi^+, K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-leptonic $D^0\to K^- K^+$ and $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ decays are powerful probes of the Standard Model and are related to each other through the $U$-spin symmetry of the strong interaction. Using lattice QCD inputs we calculate the corresponding colour-allowed tree amplitudes in factorisation and demonstrate that non-factorisable contributions and $U$-spin-breaking effects at the level of 50% allow us to accommodate the measured branching ratios in the Standard Model. An exciting direct probe of such non-factorisable and $U$-spin breaking effects is provided by the $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ channel. This decay is governed by non-factorisable exchange topologies and essentially vanishes in the $U$-spin limit, although it is experimentally well established with a prominent branching ratio. Extrapolating our $D^0\to K^- K^+$ results using the isospin symmetry, we find a consistent benchmark picture. Specifically, we can accommodate the measured $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ branching ratio with $U$-spin-breaking effects at the 50% level and exchange amplitudes at the level of 50% of the colour-allowed $D^0\to K^- K^+$, $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ tree contributions. Finally, we explore the resulting range for direct CP violation in $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$, obtaining upper bounds in our benchmark scenarios of a few per mille, offering an exciting target for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Higgs boson production via gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion using $H\rightarrow WW^\ast \rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$ decays in $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector and their effective field theory interpretations</title>

Abstract: Higgs boson production cross-sections via gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion in proton-proton collisions are measured in the $H\rightarrow WW^\ast \rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$ decay channel. The Large Hadron Collider delivered proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13\,\textrm{TeV}$ between 2015 and 2018, which were recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $140\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The total cross-sections for Higgs boson production by gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion times the $H\rightarrow WW^\ast$ branching ratio are measured to be $12.4^{+1.3}_{-1.2}\,\textrm{pb}$ and $0.79^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\,\textrm{pb}$, respectively, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. Higgs boson production is further characterised through measurements of Simplified Template Cross-Sections in a total of fifteen kinematic fiducial regions. A new scheme of kinematic fiducial regions has been introduced to enhance the sensitivity to CP-violating effects in Higgs boson interactions. Both schemes are used to constrain CP-even and CP-odd dimension-six operators in the Standard Model effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Efficient Radon Removal by Silver-Zeolite in a Dark Matter Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the performance of an efficient radon trap using silver-zeolite Ag-ETS-10, measured with a spherical proportional counter filled with an argon/methane mixture. Our study compares the radon reduction capabilities of silver-zeolite and the widely used activated charcoal, both at room temperature. We demonstrate that silver-zeolite significantly outperforms activated charcoal by three orders of magnitude in radon capture. Given that radon is a major background contaminant in rare event searches, our findings highlight silver-zeolite as a highly promising adsorbent, offering compelling operational advantages for both current and future dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Furthermore, this not only offers great promise for developing future radon reduction systems in underground laboratories, but also paves the way for innovative, multidisciplinary advancements with far-reaching implications in science, engineering and environmental health.</description>

Abstract: ATLAS, a general-purpose experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), makes use of a large internationally-distributed computing infrastructure, including over $10^6$ TB of managed data on disk and tape and almost one million simultaneously running CPU cores. Upgrades for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will increase the required computing resources by a factor of 3-4 by the beginning of the 2030s, and by an order of magnitude before the conclusion of data taking at the beginning of the 2040s. These resources are spread over around 100 computing sites worldwide. Efforts are underway within the experiment to evaluate and mitigate various aspects of the environmental impact of the sites, with the additional long-term goal of making recommendations to the sites that will significantly reduce the total expected environmental impact in the HL-LHC era. These efforts take several forms: building awareness in the experiment community, adjusting aspects of the computing policy, and modifications of data center configurations, either in ways that take advantage of particular features of ATLAS workloads or in generic ways that reduce the environmental impact of the computing resources. This paper describes the ongoing investigations and approaches that have already provided useful and actionable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Determination of the spin and parity of all-charm tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional quark model accounts for the existence of baryons, such as protons and neutrons, which consist of three quarks, as well as mesons, composed of a quark-antiquark pair. Only recently has substantial evidence started to accumulate for exotic states composed of four or five quarks and antiquarks. The exact nature of their internal structure remains uncertain. This paper reports the first measurement of quantum numbers of the recently discovered family of three all-charm tetraquarks, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider from 2016 to 2018. The angular analysis techniques developed for the discovery and characterization of the Higgs boson have been applied to the new exotic states. Here we show that the quantum numbers for parity $P$ and charge conjugation $C$ symmetries are found to be +1. The spin $J$ of these exotic states is consistent with 2$\hbar$, while 0$\hbar$ and 1$\hbar$ are excluded at 95% and 99% confidence level, respectively. The $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$ assignment implies particular configurations of constituent spins and orbital angular momenta, which constrain the possible internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CP properties of the Higgs boson are studied in the vector-boson fusion production mode. The analysis exploits the decay mode of the Higgs boson into two $\tau$-leptons using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Results are obtained using the Optimal Observable method. CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are considered in the effective field theory framework, with the interaction strength described in the HISZ basis by $\tilde{d}$, and in the Warsaw basis by $c_{H\tilde{W}}$, $c_{H\tilde{B}}$, and $c_{H\tilde{W}B}$. No deviations relative to the Standard Model are observed, and limits are obtained on the strength parameters. The $\tilde{d}$ parameter is constrained to the interval [$-0.012, 0.044$] at the 95% confidence level while $c_{H\tilde{W}}$ is constrained to [$-0.24, 0.83$], when considering both linear and quadratic effects of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The Production and Decay Dynamics of the Charmed Baryon $\Lambda_c^+$ in $e^+e^-$ Annihilations near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the charmed baryons is crucial for investigating the strong and weak interactions in the Standard Model and for gaining insights into the internal structure of baryons. In an $e^+e^-$ experiment the lightest charmed baryon, $\Lambda_c^+$, can be produced in pairs through the single photon annihilation process. This process can be described by two complex electromagnetic form factors. The presence of a non-zero relative phase between these form factors gives rise to a transverse polarization of the charmed baryon and provides additional constraints on the dynamic parameters in the decays. In this article, we present the first observation of the transverse polarization of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ in the reaction $e^+e^- \to \Lambda_c^{+}\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$, based on $6.4~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation data collected at center-of-mass energies between $4600$ MeV and $4951$ MeV with the BESIII detector. The decay asymmetry parameters in the decays $\Lambda_c^+ \to pK_S^0$, $\Lambda\pi^+$, $\Sigma^0\pi^+$, and $\Sigma^+\pi^0$ are simultaneously extracted from the joint angular distributions. From these parameters, both the weak and strong phase shifts are extracted, and several $C\!P$ observables are tested. The obtained results show that the transverse polarization of the produced baryon significantly enhances the capability of searching for $C\!P$-violating effects, opening a novel way for exploring $C\!P$ violation in the charmed baryon sector.</description>

Abstract: A search for the charmless baryonic decay $B^+\to \bar{\Lambda} p\bar{p}p$ is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4~$\text{fb}^{-1}$. The branching fraction for this decay is measured for the first time relative to that of the topologically similar decay $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$, with $J/\psi\to \bar{\Lambda} p K^-$. The branching fraction is measured to be \mbox{$\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \bar{\Lambda} p\bar{p}p) = (2.15 \pm 0.35 \pm 0.12 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{-7}$}, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third arises from the uncertainty in the normalization channel branching fraction. The $CP$ asymmetry is measured to be $\mathcal{A}_{CP}=(5.4\pm 15.6\pm 2.4)\%$, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic. The background-subtracted invariant-mass distributions of $\bar{\Lambda}p$ and $\bar{p}p$ pairs exhibit pronounced enhancements at both kinematic thresholds, in contrast to a uniform phase-space distribution.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \textsc{mute} and \textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(8.52 \pm 1.30_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(8.86 \pm 1.62_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, we develop a Depth-Intensity Relation (DIR) to predict the muon-induced neutron flux as a function of facility depth, which is consistent with measurements across a broad range of underground depths. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available at \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}, for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.</description>

      <title>GEARS - A Fully Run-Time Configurable Geant4 Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Geant4 toolkit is the standard for simulating the passage of particles through matter, but its conventional architecture often requires users to modify and recompile C++ code to alter fundamental simulation parameters such as geometry, physics list, and primary particle source. This architectural constraint introduces significant friction for new users and slows down the experimental iteration cycle. This paper introduces GEARS (Geant4 Example Application with Rich features yet Small footprint), a universally applicable Geant4 application that fundamentally addresses this issue. GEARS achieves complete simulation configurability without C++ recompilation by strictly utilizing external configuration methods: Geometry is defined via simple text-based configuration, the Physics List is selected via the standard PHYSLIST environment variable, and the Primary Source is defined through the General Particle Source (GPS) macro commands. Furthermore, regarding GEARS as an application instead of a framework, key features include a flat ntuple structure with short variable names for highly efficient analysis and a solution for capturing vital initial step data. Output creation is also fully managed via run-time macro commands and volume properties. The project is distributed as a ready-to-use Docker container to eliminate compilation barriers. Through these design considerations, GEARS transforms Geant4 into a practical, ready-to-use tool, enabling users to rapidly prototype and execute simulations for diverse experiments solely through simple text configuration files, without ever needing to modify or compile the underlying C++ source code.</description>

      <title>A telecommunications system based on axion dark matter coherent transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.07000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we anticipate axion detection in order to theorize on a novel telecommunications system based on the coherent axion-two-photon vertex Primakoff effect conversion and reversion of microwave photons transmitting a modulated signal. We suggest a possible set-up for an experiment or industrial application using state-of-the-art technology and we estimate the output power and photon rate expected to be received as a function of the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. We find that, although challenging,this system has no physical restriction to render it unfeasible. Finally, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical axion-based telecommunications system compared to traditional telecommunication systems. We then extend the discussion, noting the more important conclusions.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\text{{\div}}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \text{{\div}} 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vacuum bubbles in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) during a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a dark sector has been of recent interest. A quantity that characterizes a black hole is its spin. We carry out the first step towards determining the spin of such PBHs, by calculating the spin of spherical false vacuum bubbles induced by cosmological perturbations. The angular momentum is given by the product of density and velocity perturbations. We carefully track the evolution of background quantities and calculate the transfer functions during the FOPT. We find that the dimensionless spin parameter $s = J/(G_{\rm N} M^2)$ of false vacuum bubbles of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, take a wide range of values from ${\cal{O}}(10^{-5})$ to ${\cal{O}}(10)$ for FOPTs between 10 keV and 100 GeV and a dark sector that is 0.1 to 0.4 times cooler than the visible sector. We also find a scaling relation between the root-mean-square value of the spin, the FOPT time scale, the bubble wall velocity, and the dark sector-to-visible sector temperature ratio.</description>

      <title>Simulation of MAPS and a MAPS-based Inner Tracker for the Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a promising detector candidate for the inner tracker of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). To evaluate the performance of MAPS and the MAPS-based inner tracker, a dedicated simulation workflow has been developed, offering essential insights for detector design and optimization.
  The intrinsic characteristics of MAPS, designed using several fabrication processes and pixel geometries, were investigated through a combination of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were conducted with both minimum ionizing particles and $^{55}$Fe X-rays to assess critical parameters such as detection efficiency, cluster size, spatial resolution, and charge collection efficiency. Based on these evaluations, a MAPS sensor featuring a strip-like pixel and a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is selected as the baseline sensor design for the STCF inner tracker due to its excellent performance.
  Using this optimized MAPS design, a three-layer MAPS-based inner tracker was modeled and simulated. The simulation demonstrated an average detection efficiency exceeding 99%, spatial resolutions of 44.8$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $z$ direction and 8.2$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $r-\phi$ direction, and an intrinsic sensor time resolution of 5.9ns for 1GeV/c $\mu^-$ particles originating from the interaction point. These promising results suggest that the MAPS-based inner tracker fulfills the performance requirements of the STCF experiment.</description>

      <title>Identification of $D^*_2(3000)$ as the $D_2^*(2^3P_2)$ and exploring potential of undiscovered $2^+$ mesons via $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the $D^*_2(3000)$, its mass and full width have been extensively studied. Yet its nature remains undetermined to date. Since it was discovered through nonleptonic decay of $B$ meson and the corresponding cascade process, we therefore in this paper investigate the nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ meson to $J^P = 2^+$ charmed mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our calculations on nonleptonic $B$ decays reveal that the unconfirmed resonance $D^*_2(3000)$ aligns well with $D^*_2(2^3P_2)$ predictions. Other candidates, including $D^*_2(1^3F_2)$, $D^*_2(3^3P_2)$, and $D^*_2(2^3F_2)$, are excluded due to their very small branching ratios in $B$ decays. Considering that the $D^*_2(1F)$, $D^*_2(3P)$, and $D^*_2(2F)$ have not yet been experimentally observed, we investigate the feasibility of their detection in $B$-meson decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proposed future ultra high energy collider such as the Future Circular Collider is expected to produce intense and collimated neutrino beams from weak hadron decays. In this study, we estimate the production yields of such neutrinos from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 100~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1~ab$^{-1}$. Based on a hypothetical detector positioned either 0.5~km or 2~km downstream from the interaction point along the beamline, we derive the expected rates of charged current neutrino scattering events and their extension to neutrino energies of up to 50~TeV. We, for the first time, also evaluate the feasibility of observing the experimentally unverified direct production of $W^{\pm}$ bosons from neutrino-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>The complementary of CTAO, direct detection and collider searches for dark matter in Effective Field Theories and Simplified models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Center, within the frameworks of Effective Field Theory and Simplified Models. We present sensitivity forecasts, utilizing an up-to-date instrument configuration and incorporating the latest models for Galactic Diffuse Emission. A key aspect of our work is the inclusion of updated dark matter density profiles, J-factors, and velocity dispersion distributions derived from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which significantly impact the expected indirect detection signals. Furthermore, we update the constraints from direct detection experiments (Xenon1T and LZ) taking into account the astrophysical uncertainties informed by the FIRE-2 simulations, and also investigate limits coming from collider searches (ATLAS and CMS). Our analysis reveals improved constraints on the effective suppression scale ($M_*$) in the Effective Field Theory framework and on the mediator mass ($M_{med}$) in Simplified Models compared to previous studies, highlighting the complementarity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory with direct and collider searches in probing a wide range of dark matter scenarios. We discuss the implications of these results for various dark matter interaction types, including scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, and emphasize the importance of considering realistic astrophysical inputs in interpreting dark matter search results across different experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This was described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, primarily consists in splitting the ME calculation, previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, was recently merged into a new CUDACPP release, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some previously undocumented features of the CUDACPP software, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>

Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tree-level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Simulation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.</description>

      <title>Reviving $Z^\prime$ Portal Dark Matter with Conversion Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many new physics models with extended gauge symmetry, the new gauge boson $Z'$ could mediate the interactions between the dark matter and standard model particles. For the conventional $Z^\prime$ portal dark matter, the collider and the direct detection constraints typically pose a significant challenge. To address this pressing issue, we present in this paper a new benchmark model based on the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which introduces a Dirac dark fermion $\tilde{\chi}_1$ and a heavier partner $\tilde{\chi}_2$ with zero and nonzero $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge, respectively. Including the mass term $\delta m \bar{\tilde{\chi}}_1\tilde{\chi}_2$ results in the dark fermions $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ in the mass eigenstate, where the lighter one $\chi_1$ is regarded as the dark matter candidate. Various intriguing processes for the relic density arise with the compressed mass spectrum $m_{\chi_1}\simeq m_{\chi_2}$, such as the coscattering $\chi_2f\to\chi_1f$, the conversion $\chi_2\chi_i\to\chi_1\chi_j$, and the coannihilation $\chi_1\chi_2\to f\bar{f}$ processes. Suppressed by the small mixing angle $\theta$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $\chi_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>

      <title>Search for the Strange Dibaryons with Baryon Correlations in Isobar Collisions at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dibaryons provide insight into the strong interaction beyond conventional hadrons. Strange dibaryons, containing strange quarks, are especially valuable for probing hyperon-nucleon (YN) and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions. We report measurements of $p$-$\Xi^-$ and $p$-$\Omega^-$ correlation functions in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. The analysis, using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism, yields scattering parameters that offer key implications for the possible formation of strange dibaryon bound states, particularly $H$ ($S = -2$) and $N\Omega$ ($S = -3$).</description>
