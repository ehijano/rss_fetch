      <title>Spin-Weighted Spherical Harmonics for Polarized Light Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of polarization rendering is to simulate the interaction of light with materials exhibiting polarization-dependent behavior. However, integrating polarization into rendering is challenging and increases computational costs significantly. The primary difficulty lies in efficiently modeling and computing the complex reflection phenomena associated with polarized light. Specifically, frequency-domain analysis, essential for efficient environment lighting and storage of complex light interactions, is lacking. To efficiently simulate and reproduce polarized light interactions using frequency-domain techniques, we address the challenge of maintaining continuity in polarized light transport represented by Stokes vectors within angular domains. The conventional spherical harmonics method cannot effectively handle continuity and rotation invariance for Stokes vectors. To overcome this, we develop a new method called polarized spherical harmonics (PSH) based on the spin-weighted spherical harmonics theory. Our method provides a rotation-invariant representation of Stokes vector fields. Furthermore, we introduce frequency domain formulations of polarized rendering equations and spherical convolution based on PSH. We first define spherical convolution on Stokes vector fields in the angular domain, and it also provides efficient computation of polarized light transport, nearly on an entry-wise product in the frequency domain. Our frequency domain formulation, including spherical convolution, led to the development of the first real-time polarization rendering technique under polarized environmental illumination, named precomputed polarized radiance transfer, using our polarized spherical harmonics. Results demonstrate that our method can effectively and accurately simulate and reproduce polarized light interactions in complex reflection phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Collage Visualization Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collage techniques are commonly used in visualization to organize a collection of geometric shapes, facilitating the representation of visual features holistically, as seen in word clouds or circular packing diagrams. Typically, packing methods rely on object-space optimization techniques, which often necessitate customizing the optimization process to suit the complexity of geometric primitives and the specific application requirements. In this paper, we introduce a versatile image-space collage technique designed to pack geometric elements into a given shape. Leveraging a differential renderer and image-space losses, our optimization process is highly efficient and can easily accommodate various loss functions. We demonstrate the diverse visual expressiveness of our approach across various visualization applications. The evaluation confirmed the benefits of our method in terms of both visual quality and time performance. The project page is https://szuviz.github.io/pixel-space-collage-technique/.</description>
