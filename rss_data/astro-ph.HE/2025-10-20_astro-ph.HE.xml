      <title>Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</description>

      <title>Gradus.jl: spacetime-agnostic general relativistic ray-tracing for X-ray spectral modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Gradus.jl, an open-source and publicly available general relativistic ray-tracing toolkit for spectral modelling in arbitrary spacetimes. Our software is written in the Julia programming language, making use of forward-mode automatic differentiation for computing the Christoffel symbols during geodesic integration, and for propagating derivatives through the entire ray-tracer. Relevant numerical methods are detailed, and our models are validated using a number of tests and comparisons to other codes. The differentiability is used to optimally calculate Cunningham transfer functions -- used to efficiently pre-compute relativistic effects in spectral models. A method is described for calculating such transfer functions for disc with non-zero vertical height, including the treatment of self-obscuration. An extension of the transfer function formalism that includes timing information is described, and used to calculate high-resolution reverberation lag spectra for a lamppost corona. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra for a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with various lamppost heights and Eddington ratios are calculated, and the general impact of disc thickness in reflection models is discussed.</description>

      <title>Wave-Mediated Boundary Layers of Accretion Discs: Role of Internal Structure of the Accretor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds through the boundary layer (BL) -- a radially narrow region in the inner disc where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object. While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes mediating the BL transport.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Distance for Probing the Nuclear Equation of State with Supernova Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Nuclear Reaction Rates in X-ray Burst Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear runaways on the surface of accreting neutron stars, powered by rapid proton-capture and alpha-capture processes on neutron-deficient nuclei. Uncertainties in the corresponding reaction rates remain a major limitation in modeling burst light curves and ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network, followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187 that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most (p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A &gt; 32) and heavy-mass (A &gt; 55) nuclei influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A ~ 110. We identify a subset of reactions whose rate uncertainties exert influence on the final 12C yield in helium-rich bursts, which could have important consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results identify key targets for nuclear reaction experiments to reduce nuclear physics uncertainties in XRB models.</description>

      <title>Event types in H.E.S.S.: a combined analysis for different telescope types and energy ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are the main technique for detecting gamma rays with energies between tens of GeV and hundreds of TeV. Amongst them, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has pioneered the use of different telescope types to achieve an energy range as broad as possible. A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access the lowest energies ($E \gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter telescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and 100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger strategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first time an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope types, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to the large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the types are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in three types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different energy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared to the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and Stereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole energy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy ranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for most of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the Crab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of combining significantly different telescope types with significantly different energy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller statistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed. The need for a run-by-run correction for the observation conditions is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem", namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.</description>

      <title>Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the blazar 1ES 0229+200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations are essential to achieve a deeper understanding of the broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200 collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024, complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond 100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of high-energy neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>J-GEM near-infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event S240422ed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $&gt;$ 99% probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations 7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in $Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$), respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) - VI: $\gamma$-ray Emission in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions, which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model, a sensitivity of $F_\gamma &lt; 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.</description>

      <title>Born to be recycled: a comprehensive population synthesis of the Galactic millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date. To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10${\deg}). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.</description>

      <title>From Localization to Discovery: Bayesian Ranking of Electromagnetic Counterparts to Gravitational-Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.</description>

      <title>A merger within a merger: Chandra pinpoints the short GRB 230906A in a peculiar environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration ($T_{90}\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\ast$; $F160W\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position. Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color would suggest a high redshift ($z\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\!\sim$0.453, confirmed spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended ($\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\!\lesssim\!4$\%), we thus argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor compact binary $\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained. We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho &lt; 20$, time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical uncertainties dominate.</description>

      <title>Antikaon condensation in magnetized neutron star matter within the framework of the $\sigma$-cut scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of strong magnetic fields on antikaon condensation in neutron star matter using the extended FSUGold model model. It is found that the presence of strong magnetic fields alters the threshold density of antikaon condensation significantly, which means the threshold density of antikaon condensation is shifted to higher density compared with the magnetic field-free case. In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the equation of state (EoS) becomes stiffer than that of the zero field case. The effects of the $\sigma$-cut scheme on the EoS are also researched when the appearance of antikaon condensation is occurred. Through careful choice of the parameter of the $\sigma$-cut scheme, we are able to produce a maximum mass neutron star heavier than 2$M_{sun}$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dark Matter Bosonic Stars in regularized 4D Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have constructed anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star (DMS) solutions in the context of a regularized four-dimensional Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity theory. Using dimensional regularization, we solve modified Tolman$-$Oppenheimer$-$Volkoff equations for a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime, $p_r = K \rho^2$, with anisotropy parameterized as $\sigma = \beta\, p_r \left( 1 - e^{-2\lambda} \right)$. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis across the \((\alpha,\beta)\) parameter domain, where \(\alpha \in [0,8]~\mathrm{km}^2\) and \(\beta \in [-2,0]\), to examine mass$-$radius relations and evaluate multiple stability indicators including static equilibrium \(dM/dp_c\), sound-speed causality, the radial adiabatic index \(\Gamma_r\), and energy conditions. Positive Gauss$-$Bonnet coupling enhances both the maximum mass and compactness (e.g., \(M_{\rm max} \approx 1.62\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha=0\) rising to \(\approx 2.09\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha = 8~\mathrm{km}^2\)), while negative anisotropy reduces them (e.g., from \(\approx 2.21\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta=0\) to \(\approx 1.73\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta = -2\)). The resulting configurations remain statically stable up to the mass peak and satisfy physical criteria. This work extends previous isotropic boson-star analyses by systematically incorporating anisotropy within a regularized 4D EGB framework. These findings provide observationally relevant predictions for compact dark-matter objects under modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Relativistic tidal divergences in circular orbits and the dynamics of light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these objects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with ultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes, focusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to the case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null circular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density stellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential stresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings may play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless objects.</description>

      <title>BREAKFAST: A Framework for general joint BA duty and follow-up guidance of multiple $\gamma$-ray monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates (BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Identification of Gravitationally Microlensed Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provides a unique opportunity to probe compact dark matter and small-scale structures in the Universe. However, identifying such microlensed GRBs within large data sets is a significant challenge. In this study, we develop a machine learning (ML) approach to distinguish lensed GRBs from their nonlensed counterparts, using simulated light curves. A comprehensive data set is generated, comprising labeled light curves for both categories. Features are extracted using the Cesium package, capturing critical temporal properties of the light curves. Multiple ML models are trained on the extracted features, with Random Forest achieving the best performance, delivering an accuracy of 86% and an F1 score of 0.86 (0.87) for the nonlensed (lensed) class. This approach successfully demonstrates the potential of ML for identifying gravitational lensing in GRBs, paving the way for future observational applications.</description>

      <title>JWST and Ground-based Observations of the Type Iax Supernovae SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm: Evidence for Weak Deflagration Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present panchromatic optical $+$ near-infrared (NIR) $+$ mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the intermediate-luminosity Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) 2024pxl and the extremely low-luminosity SN Iax 2024vjm. JWST observations provide unprecedented MIR spectroscopy of SN Iax, spanning from $+$11 to $+$42 days past maximum light. We detect forbidden emission lines in the MIR at these early times while the optical and NIR are dominated by permitted lines with an absorption component. Panchromatic spectra at early times can thus simultaneously show nebular and photospheric lines, probing both inner and outer layers of the ejecta. We identify spectral lines not seen before in SN Iax, including [Mg II] 4.76 $\mu$m, [Mg II] 9.71 $\mu$m, [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, and isolated O I 2.76 $\mu$m that traces unburned material. Forbidden emission lines of all species are centrally peaked with similar kinematic distributions, indicating that the ejecta are well mixed in both SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm, a hallmark of pure deflagration explosion models. Radiative transfer modeling of SN 2024pxl shows good agreement with a weak deflagration of a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, but additional IR flux is needed to match the observations, potentially attributable to a surviving remnant. Similarly, we find SN 2024vjm is also best explained by a weak deflagration model, despite the large difference in luminosity between the two supernovae. Future modeling should push to even weaker explosions and include the contribution of a bound remnant. Our observations demonstrate the diagnostic power of panchromatic spectroscopy for unveiling explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae.</description>

      <title>Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1--0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models for lightcurves and photosphere properties of Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferences on the properties Type II supernovae (SNe) can provide significant insights into the lives and deaths of the astrophysical population of massive stars and potentially provide measurements of luminosity distance, independent of the distance ladder. Here, we introduce surrogate models for the photospheric properties and lightcurves of Type II SNe trained on a large grid of simulations from the radiation hydrodynamics code, {\sc stella}. The trained model can accurately and efficiently ($\sim 30$ms) predict the lightcurves and properties of Type II SNe within a large parameter space of progenitor ($10-18 M_{\odot}$ at ZAMS) and nickel masses ($0.001-0.3M_{\odot}$), progenitor mass-loss rate ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), CSM radius ($1-10\times10^{14}$cm), and SN explosion energies ($0.5-5 \times 10^{51}$erg). We validate this model through inference on lightcurves and photosphere properties drawn directly from the original {\sc stella} simulations not included in training. In particular, for a synthetic Type II SNe observed within the 10-year LSST survey, we find we can measure the progenitor and nickel masses with $\approx 9\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ precision, respectively, when fitting the photometric data while accounting for the uncertainty in the surrogate model itself. Meanwhile, from real observations of SN~2004et, SN~2012aw, and SN~2017gmr we infer a progenitor ZAMS mass of $12.15_{-1.06}^{+1.03} M_{\odot}$, $10.61_{-0.32}^{+0.37} M_{\odot}$, $10.4 \pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$, respectively. We discuss systematic uncertainties from our surrogate modelling approach and likelihood approaches to account for these uncertainties. We further discuss future extensions to the model to enable stronger constraints on properties of Type II SNe and their progenitors, and applications of our surrogate modelling approach to other transients.</description>

      <title>Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations</title>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</description>

      <title>Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and its proposed successor AMS-100, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that AMS-02 will have sensitivity to gamma-ray polarization only for the brightest steady-state Galactic sources, such as the Vela and Geminga pulsars; it is not expected to be capable of detecting polarization in Galactic or extragalactic sources that have been previously proposed as good targets for ALP searches with gamma-ray intensity measurements. However, AMS-100 observing the extragalactic source NGC1275 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for unfavorable B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</description>

      <title>Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. We show that young progenitors with an age of less than 1 Myr are consistent with our inferred distribution of host DM at 95 percent confidence. These young sources may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating covariant anisotropic objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mean number of muons with energies above 500 GeV in air showers detected with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the mean number of muons with energies larger than 500 GeV in near-vertical extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with primary energies between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV. The measurement is based on events detected in coincidence between the surface and in-ice detectors of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Air showers are recorded on the surface by IceTop, while a bundle of high-energy muons ("TeV muons") from the shower can subsequently produce a track-like event in the IceCube in-ice array. Results are obtained assuming the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC. The measured number of TeV muons is found to be in agreement with predictions from air-shower simulations. The results have also been compared to a measurement of low-energy muons by IceTop, indicating an inconsistency between the predictions for low- and high-energy muons in simulations based on the EPOS-LHC model.</description>

      <title>Signals of Bursts from the Very Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider possible observable signals from explosive events in the very early universe, ``bursts". These could be expected in connection
  with massive black hole or ``baby universe'' formation. We anticipate that such major disruptions of spacetime would be associated with
  neutrino and perhaps other pulses. While these seem to be not
  detectable directly, we discuss how they could lead to potentially observable signals. We analyze how the pulses from very early times
  may ``escape'', that is
  propagate to the last scattering epoch at the time $t_{cmb}$ and later,
  or alternatively be absorbed earlier, ``contained''. The possibly detectable signals include effects on small regions of the CMB, a soft x-ray resulting from positron production, or a nonthermal addition to
  the relic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified view of agnostic parametrizations for deformed black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</description>
