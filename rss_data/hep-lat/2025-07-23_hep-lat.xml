      <title>Construction of general $N$-body lattice operators with arbitrary momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing lattice QCD operators for systems of an arbitrary number of particles with arbitrary momentum, spin, and internal quantum numbers. Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-, three-, and four-hadron operators, covering all irreducible representations of the relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The construction procedure has been implemented in the open-source package \texttt{OpTion} (Operator construcTion), available at https://github.com/wittscien/OpTion. The paper and the package are designed to serve as a practical and extensible dictionary for future lattice QCD studies, as lattice calculations advance towards increasingly complex hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>N=1 Supersymmetric QCD on the lattice using overlap fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using N=1 Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) as a prototype model, this work presents a formulation of overlap quarks and gluinos on the lattice, with particular emphasis on the construction of chirally symmetric Yukawa terms. By incorporating the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, chiral transformations, and the Majorana condition for gluinos, we construct a consistent framework that preserves a lattice-modified chiral symmetry and reduces the number of required counterterms compared to Wilson-type discretizations. The formulation introduces auxiliary fermionic fields to realize exact chiral symmetry in Yukawa interactions and enables a detailed analysis of the resulting matrix structures. Upon functionally integrating out the auxiliary fields, ultralocal interaction terms emerge as new contributions to the lattice action. This approach provides a robust foundation for nonperturbative lattice studies of supersymmetric gauge theories. Future work will focus on computing all perturbative fine-tunings required in this formulation to enable continuum matching and numerical simulations of SQCD.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic, systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Zurek's scaling-law in the Ising model out of thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble mechanism plays a prominent role in the theory of the early Universe, as an explanation of the possible formation of cosmic strings. Zurek suggested the analogous effect in liquid helium under rapid cooling, and he conjectured - together with del Campo and Kibble - a scaling-law for the relation between the density of remnant topological defects and the cooling rate, when a system passes through its critical temperature. Such scaling-laws were indeed observed in condensed matter experiments.
  Here we test the validity of Zurek's scaling-law in a different framework. We numerically study the behavior of the Ising model (with classical spins) in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions under rapid cooling. This model does not have topological defects, so we consider the dynamics of domains instead, i.e. we measure their evolution during a cooling process down to zero temperature. For several Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, we consistently observe scaling-laws along the lines of Zurek's conjecture, in all dimensions under consideration, which shows that this feature holds more generally than expected. It is highly remarkable that even the exponents of these scaling-laws are consistent for three different algorithms, which hints at a physical meaning.</description>

      <title>"Odd" Toric Code in a tilted field: Higgs-confinement multicriticality, spontaneous self-duality symmetry breaking, and valence bond solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Nuclear Effective Field Theories</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources to realize this potential, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. Within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. For the latter, we consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. Within these models, we examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. We find that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate, followed by the one-pion-exchange theory, then the dynamical-pion theory. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. In the process, we develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic number-preserving Hamiltonians, and obtain tighter Trotter error bounds by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. Compared to previous estimates for the pionless EFT, our results represent an improvement by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>
