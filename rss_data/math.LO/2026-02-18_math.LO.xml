      <title>da Costa and Tarski meet Goguen and Carnap: a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity based on consequence systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity that draws heavily from Carnapian-Goguenism, as presented by Kutz, Mossakowski and L\"ucke (2010). The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for the field of applied ontology and suggest directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Irreducible distinguishing colourings and the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a vertex or edge colouring of a graph is distinguishing if the only automorphism that preserves this colouring is the identity. A (proper) distinguishing colouring is irreducible if there is no possibility of merging two non-empty classes of colours to obtain a (proper) distinguishing colouring. We show that every graph has an irreducible (proper) distinguishing vertex colouring and that every graph without isolated edge and with at most one isolated vertex has an irreducible (proper) distinguishing edge colouring. Moreover, we show that the existence of any of these colourings for every connected graph (not isomorphic to $K_2$) is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reduction of properties (invariants) of compact sets of real numbers to properties of countable orders is presented here. Discussed here is also an embedding property of some compact sets that are called t$\mathbb R$-sets. Among others, it is proved that there are exactly $\omega_1$ many non-homeomorphic t$\mathbb R$-sets.</description>

      <title>Separable C*-algebras Without the Countable Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. In addition to the results stated in the next paragraph, we present some classical results on absoluteness relevant to functional analysis that are well known to logicians but not nearly as well advertised as they should be. We show that the theory of separable C*-algebras can be developed in ZF (that is, without using any Choice). This includes proving the Gelfand-Naimark representation theorems as well as the Spectral Mapping Theorem for polynomials and developing continuous functional calculus for commuting normal elements. Some of our proofs are modifications of the standard ones, obtained by avoiding the use of Choice. Some other proofs require new ideas in order to avoid the use of Choice. Yet another batch of proofs proceeds by using the set-theoretic Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem. This result (well known to logicians but regrettably not as well advertised as it deserves) implies that statements about standard Borel spaces of low quantifier complexity that are provable in ZFC, or even ZFC together with the Continuum Hypothesis are provable in ZF. One of the main objectives of this paper is to present these results in a convenient form that can be utilized by analysts not familiar with set theory. We also show that in the absence of Choice (more precisely, assuming the existence of a Russell set) there is a concretely representable unital commutative \cstar-algebra that is not isomorphic to C(X) for any compact Hausdorff space X. Finally, from the model-theoretic point of view, while the property of having a tracial state is provably axiomatizable in ZFC, it is not provably axiomatizable in ZF+DC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a variation of Woodin's $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$ forcing, we force over a model of the Axiom of Determinacy to produce a model of ZFC containing a very strongly increasing sequence of length $\omega_{2}$ consisting of functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$. We also show that there can be no such sequence of length $\omega_{4}$.</description>

      <title>Verified Program Extraction in Number Theory: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article revisits standard theorems from elementary number theory from a constructive, algorithmic, and proof-theoretic perspective, framed within the theory of computable functionals TCF. Key examples include B\'ezout's identity, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and Fermat's factorisation method. All definitions and theorems are fully formalised in the proof assistant Minlog, laying the foundation for a comprehensive formal framework for number theory within Minlog.
  While formalisation guarantees correctness, the primary emphasis is on the computational content of proofs. Leveraging Minlog's built-in program extraction, we obtain executable terms and export them as Haskell code.
  The efficiency of the extracted programs plays a central role. We show how performance considerations influence even the original formulation of theorems and proofs. In particular, we compare formalisations based on binary encodings of natural numbers with those using the traditional unary (successor-based) representation.
  We present several core proofs in detail and reflect on the challenges that arise from formalisation in contrast to informal reasoning. The complete formalisation is available online and linked throughout. Minlog's tactic scripts are designed to follow the structure of natural-language proofs, allowing each derivation step to be traced precisely and thereby bridging the gap between formal and classical mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Reduction Complexities in Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02766v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Ca2016} and \cite{Ca2018}, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in \cite{Ca2025}, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we obtain a considerably refined analysis through interpolating between these two notions: Namely, we ask how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us to make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.</description>

      <title>On the $\Sigma^0_1$-Completeness of Cubic Diophantine Systems and their Consequences for Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathrm{H}\mathbb{N}(3,n)=\mathrm{U}$ for some fixed $n$. The core result is a uniform primitive recursive compiler from sentence codes to finite cubic Diophantine systems over $\mathbb{N}$, such that arithmetic theoremhood is equivalent to cubic solvability on the compiler image. The translation is explicit: finite proof traces are arithmetized, local syntactic and inference checks are compiled to quadratic constraints, and one guard gadget $u = 1+v^2, u\cdot E = 0$ provides the unique degree escalation from $2$ to $3$ while preserving solvability. The construction is mechanized in $\textsf{Rocq}$ and certified in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, including uniform computability, checker--constraint equivalence, and a global degree-$3$ bound for emitted systems. From this certified core, undecidability is obtained by a classical fixed-point Diagonal Argument: any total correct decider for cubic satisfiability computes a mirror cubic instance on which it fails. Consequently cubic satisfiability is $\Sigma^0_1$-complete, and in particular there is no total correct procedure deciding all degree-$3$ Diophantine instances.</description>

      <title>The Cofinality of Generating Familes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of a separable metrizable space $M$ is \emph{generated} by a family $\mathcal{C}$ of its subsets provided that a set $A\subseteq M$ is closed in $M$ if and only if $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$ for each $C\in \mathcal{C}$. The \emph{sequentiality number}, $\mathop{seq}(M)$, and \emph{$k$-ness number}, $\mathop{k}(M)$, of $M$, are the minimum size of a generating family of convergent sequences, respectively compact subsets.
  Let $\mathfrak{b}$ be the minimum size of an unbounded set in $\omega^\omega$ with the mod finite order. For a cardinal $\kappa$, the \emph{covering number}, $\mathop{cov}(\kappa)$, is the minimum size of a family of countable subsets of $\kappa$ so that every countable subset of $\kappa$ is contained in an element of the family. It is shown using the Tukey order on relations that (1) $\mathop{seq}(M)=\mathop{cov}(|M|)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$, unless $M$ is locally small (every point of $M$ has a neighborhood of size strictly less than $|M|$) in which case $\mathop{seq}(M)=\lim_{\mu &lt;|M|} \mathop{cov}(\mu)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$ and (2) $k(M)$ is in the interval $[kc(M)\cdot\mathfrak{b},\mathop{cov}(kc(M))\cdot \mathfrak{b}]$, where $kc(M)$ is the minimum number of compact sets that cover $M$.
  Solutions to problems of van Douwen's on the $k$-ness number of analytic and of co-analytic spaces are deduced.</description>
