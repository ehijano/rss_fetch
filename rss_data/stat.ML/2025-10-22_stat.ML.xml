      <title>Graphical model for tensor factorization by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Graphs from Incomplete Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of jointly inferring time-varying network topologies and imputing missing data from partially observed graph signals. We propose a unified non-convex optimization framework to simultaneously recover a sequence of graph Laplacian matrices while reconstructing the unobserved signal entries. Unlike conventional decoupled methods, our integrated approach facilitates a bidirectional flow of information between the graph and signal domains, yielding superior robustness, particularly in high missing-data regimes. To capture realistic network dynamics, we introduce a fused-lasso type regularizer on the sequence of Laplacians. This penalty promotes temporal smoothness by penalizing large successive changes, thereby preventing spurious variations induced by noise while still permitting gradual topological evolution. For solving the joint optimization problem, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which leverages the problem's structure to yield closed-form solutions for both the graph and signal subproblems. This design ensures scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. On the theoretical front, despite the inherent non-convexity, we establish a convergence guarantee, proving that the proposed ADMM scheme converges to a stationary point. Furthermore, we derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees, providing high-probability error bounds for the graph estimator as a function of sample size, signal smoothness, and the intrinsic temporal variability of the graph. Extensive numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both convergence speed and the joint accuracy of graph learning and signal recovery.</description>

      <title>Arbitrated Indirect Treatment Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) has been increasingly employed in health technology assessments (HTA). By reweighting subjects from a trial with individual participant data (IPD) to match the covariate summary statistics of another trial with only aggregate data (AgD), MAIC facilitates the estimation of a treatment effect defined with respect to the AgD trial population. This manuscript introduces a new class of methods, termed arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons, designed to address the ``MAIC paradox'' -- a phenomenon highlighted by Jiang et al.~(2025). The MAIC paradox arises when different sponsors, analyzing the same data, reach conflicting conclusions regarding which treatment is more effective. The underlying issue is that each sponsor implicitly targets a different population. To resolve this inconsistency, the proposed methods focus on estimating treatment effects in a common target population, specifically chosen to be the overlap population.</description>

      <title>Generalization Below the Edge of Stability: The Role of Data Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding generalization in overparameterized neural networks hinges on the interplay between the data geometry, neural architecture, and training dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability. First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls, we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension. Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder to "shatter" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons, gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical findings that have appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Beating the Winner's Curse via Inference-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies to target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common approach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective value. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy has better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy evaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy optimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual improvements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by downstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy optimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream. Specifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also for the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than the observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize the Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals. Based on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that uses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in these predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can select the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy evaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.</description>

      <title>The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Data-Driven Optimization: A Local Misspecification Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven stochastic optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning and operational decision-making problems. Sample average approximation (SAA) and model-based approaches such as estimate-then-optimize (ETO) or integrated estimation-optimization (IEO) are all popular, with model-based approaches being able to circumvent some of the issues with SAA in complex context-dependent problems. Yet the relative performance of these methods is poorly understood, with most results confined to the dichotomous cases of the model-based approach being either well-specified or misspecified. We develop the first results that allow for a more granular analysis of the relative performance of these methods under a local misspecification setting, which models the scenario where the model-based approach is nearly well-specified. By leveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a bias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification, and that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the degree of local misspecification. Moreover, we derive explicit expressions for the decision bias, which allows us to characterize (un)impactful misspecification directions, and provide further geometric understanding of the variance.</description>

      <title>Learning under Quantization for High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error. Crucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent quantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for additive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling effect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Parametrising the Inhomogeneity Inducing Capacity of a Training Set, and its Impact on Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce parametrisation of that property of the available
  training dataset, that necessitates an inhomogeneous correlation
  structure for the function that is learnt as a model of the
  relationship between the pair of variables, observations of which
  comprise the considered training data. We refer to a parametrisation
  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity
  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large
  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple
  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that
  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero
  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the
  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training
  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,
  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be
  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate
  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions
  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity
  parameter of the training data.</description>

      <title>Interval Prediction of Annual Average Daily Traffic on Local Roads via Quantile Random Forest with High-Dimensional Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport planning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</description>

      <title>A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.</description>

      <title>Memorizing Long-tail Data Can Help Generalization Through Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its architecture.</description>

      <title>VERA-V: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Models on Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18037v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.</description>

      <title>Fast Agnostic Learners in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational efficiency of agnostic learning for several fundamental geometric concept classes in the plane. While the sample complexity of agnostic learning is well understood, its time complexity has received much less attention. We study the class of triangles and, more generally, the class of convex polygons with $k$ vertices for small $k$, as well as the class of convex sets in a square. We present a proper agnostic learner for the class of triangles that has optimal sample complexity and runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-6}})$, improving on the algorithm of Dobkin and Gunopulos (COLT `95) that runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$. For 4-gons and 5-gons, we improve the running time from $O({\epsilon^{-12}})$, achieved by Fischer and Kwek (eCOLT `96), to $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-8}})$ and $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$, respectively.
  We also design a proper agnostic learner for convex sets under the uniform distribution over a square with running time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-5}})$, improving on the previous $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-8})$ bound at the cost of slightly higher sample complexity. Notably, agnostic learning of convex sets in $[0,1]^2$ under general distributions is impossible because this concept class has infinite VC-dimension. Our agnostic learners use data structures and algorithms from computational geometry and their analysis relies on tools from geometry and probabilistic combinatorics. Because our learners are proper, they yield tolerant property testers with matching running times. Our results raise a fundamental question of whether a gap between the sample and time complexity is inherent for agnostic learning of these and other natural concept classes.</description>

      <title>Latent Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.</description>

      <title>Rethinking PCA Through Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and (kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of the reconstruction errors.</description>

      <title>FST.ai 2.0: An Explainable AI Ecosystem for Fair, Fast, and Inclusive Decision-Making in Olympic and Paralympic Taekwondo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18193v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair, transparent, and explainable decision-making remains a critical challenge in Olympic and Paralympic combat sports. This paper presents \emph{FST.ai 2.0}, an explainable AI ecosystem designed to support referees, coaches, and athletes in real time during Taekwondo competitions and training. The system integrates {pose-based action recognition} using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), {epistemic uncertainty modeling} through credal sets, and {explainability overlays} for visual decision support. A set of {interactive dashboards} enables human--AI collaboration in referee evaluation, athlete performance analysis, and Para-Taekwondo classification. Beyond automated scoring, FST.ai~2.0 incorporates modules for referee training, fairness monitoring, and policy-level analytics within the World Taekwondo ecosystem. Experimental validation on competition data demonstrates an {85\% reduction in decision review time} and {93\% referee trust} in AI-assisted decisions. The framework thus establishes a transparent and extensible pipeline for trustworthy, data-driven officiating and athlete assessment. By bridging real-time perception, explainable inference, and governance-aware design, FST.ai~2.0 represents a step toward equitable, accountable, and human-aligned AI in sports.</description>

      <title>The Picard-Lagrange Framework for Higher-Order Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from log-concave distributions is a central problem in statistics and machine learning. Prior work establishes theoretical guarantees for Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm based on overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics and, more recently, some third-order variants. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling algorithm built on a general $K$th-order Langevin dynamics, extending beyond second- and third-order methods. To discretize the $K$th-order dynamics, we approximate the drift induced by the potential via Lagrange interpolation and refine the node values at the interpolation points using Picard-iteration corrections, yielding a flexible scheme that fully utilizes the acceleration of higher-order Langevin dynamics. For targets with smooth, strongly log-concave densities, we prove dimension-dependent convergence in Wasserstein distance: the sampler achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy within $\widetilde O(d^{\frac{K-1}{2K-3}}\varepsilon^{-\frac{2}{2K-3}})$ gradient evaluations for $K \ge 3$. To our best knowledge, this is the first sampling algorithm achieving such query complexity. The rate improves with the order $K$ increases, yielding better rates than existing first to third-order approaches.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation by Flexible Evidential Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning} ($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Overparametrization bends the landscape: BBP transitions at initialization in simple Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional non-convex loss landscapes play a central role in the theory of Machine Learning. Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with gradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed light on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus on a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase Retrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized settings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the Hessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) transition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the initialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a teacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can bend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the information-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization limit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical predictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N behavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N corrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates for a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization becomes entirely uninformative.</description>

      <title>Optimality and NP-Hardness of Transformers in Learning Markovian Dynamical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general, revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated using simplified transformers.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private E-Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-values have gained prominence as flexible tools for statistical inference and risk control, enabling anytime- and post-hoc-valid procedures under minimal assumptions. However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare, and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and illustrate its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fractional Gradient Descent with Learned Optimizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in optimization.</description>

      <title>Protein generation with embedding learning for motif diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in protein design is the trade-off between generating structural diversity while preserving motif biological function. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail to resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to the native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric constraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation with Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns high-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a target motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen denoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled perturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric constraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse yet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a monomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor complex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better designability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion. Our results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein generation allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional motifs.</description>

      <title>Inference on Local Variable Importance Measures for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an inferential framework to assess variable importance for heterogeneous treatment effects. This assessment is especially useful in high-risk domains such as medicine, where decision makers hesitate to rely on black-box treatment recommendation algorithms. The variable importance measures we consider are local in that they may differ across individuals, while the inference is global in that it tests whether a given variable is important for any individual. Our approach builds on recent developments in semiparametric theory for function-valued parameters, and is valid even when statistical machine learning algorithms are employed to quantify treatment effect heterogeneity. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to infectious disease prevention strategies.</description>

      <title>On Generalization and Distributional Update for Mimicking Observations with Adequate Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from observations (LfO) replicates expert behavior without needing access to the expert's actions, making it more practical than learning from demonstrations (LfD) in many real-world scenarios. However, directly applying the on-policy training scheme in LfO worsens the sample inefficiency problem, while employing the traditional off-policy training scheme in LfO magnifies the instability issue. This paper seeks to develop an efficient and stable solution for the LfO problem. Specifically, we begin by exploring the generalization capabilities of both the reward function and policy in LfO, which provides a theoretical foundation for computation. Building on this, we modify the policy optimization method in generative adversarial imitation from observation (GAIfO) with distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC), and propose the Mimicking Observations through Distributional Update Learning with adequate Exploration (MODULE) algorithm to solve the LfO problem. MODULE incorporates the advantages of (1) high sample efficiency and training robustness enhancement in soft actor-critic (SAC), and (2) training stability in distributional reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments in MuJoCo environments showcase the superior performance of MODULE over current LfO methods.</description>

      <title>The $\varphi$ Curve: The Shape of Generalization through the Lens of Norm-based Capacity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the test risk scales with model complexity is a central question in machine learning. Classical theory is challenged by the learning curves observed for large over-parametrized deep networks. Capacity measures based on parameter count typically fail to account for these empirical observations. To tackle this challenge, we consider norm-based capacity measures and develop our study for random features based estimators, widely used as simplified theoretical models for more complex networks. In this context, we provide a precise characterization of how the estimator's norm concentrates and how it governs the associated test error. Our results show that the predicted learning curve admits a phase transition from under- to over-parameterization, but no double descent behavior. This confirms that more classical U-shaped behavior is recovered considering appropriate capacity measures based on models norms rather than size. From a technical point of view, we leverage deterministic equivalence as the key tool and further develop new deterministic quantities which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</description>

      <title>Nearly Dimension-Independent Convergence of Mean-Field Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family, black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient converges at a rate that is nearly independent of explicit dimension dependence. Specifically, for a $d$-dimensional strongly log-concave and log-smooth target, the number of iterations for BBVI with a sub-Gaussian family to obtain a solution $\epsilon$-close to the global optimum has a dimension dependence of $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$. This is a significant improvement over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$ dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we prove a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dependence, where $k$ is the number of finite moments of the family. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of the target log-density.</description>

      <title>ALINE: Joint Amortization for Bayesian Inference and Active Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it. While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks, optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof. Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate inference along with efficient selection of informative points.</description>

      <title>AICO: Feature Significance Tests for Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge, hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful, randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings. Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational advantages, and applications to real-world data demonstrate its ability to inform high-stakes decisions with legal, economic, and regulatory implications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Planning in Correlated Obstacle Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.</description>

      <title>A novel Information-Driven Strategy for Optimal Regression Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework for nonparametric mean-variance optimization and inference on shape constraints of the optimal rule. We derive statistical properties of the sample estimator and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, such as asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and a finite-sample deviation bound that matches the Monte Carlo rate up to regularization. Building on these findings, we introduce a joint Wald-type statistic to test for shape constraints over finite grids. The approach comes with an efficient computational procedure based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large datasets. Empirical tests suggest favorably of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>One-Pass Learning via Bridging Orthogonal Gradient Descent and Recursive Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes over the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous datapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized models and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to perfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on previous datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to past gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual learning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation similar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering but with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e., linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reduce memory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using the principal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-case forgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, we prove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12465v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates preconditioned conjugate gradient techniques for solving kernel ridge regression (KRR) problems with a medium to large number of data points ($10^4 \leq N \leq 10^7$), and it describes two methods with the strongest guarantees available. The first method, RPCholesky preconditioning, accurately solves the full-data KRR problem in $O(N^2)$ arithmetic operations, assuming sufficiently rapid polynomial decay of the kernel matrix eigenvalues. The second method, KRILL preconditioning, offers an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k \ll N$ selected data centers at a cost of $O((N + k^2) k \log k)$ operations. The proposed methods efficiently solve a range of KRR problems, making them well-suited for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, particularly in deep learning models, is a critical challenge due to nuanced definitions of fairness, dataset-specific biases, and the inherent trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach that enhances fairness in neural networks by integrating variance, invariance, and covariance terms into the loss function during training. Unlike methods that rely on predefined fairness criteria, FairVIC abstracts fairness concepts to minimise dependency on protected characteristics. We evaluate FairVIC against comparable bias mitigation techniques on benchmark datasets, considering both group and individual fairness, and conduct an ablation study on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. FairVIC demonstrates significant improvements ($\approx70\%$) in fairness across all tested metrics without compromising accuracy, thus offering a robust, generalisable solution for fair deep learning across diverse tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Theory of Contrastive Pre-training and Multimodal Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI systems, such as those combining vision and language, rely on contrastive pre-training to learn representations across different modalities. While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>LLM Safety Alignment is Divergence Estimation in Disguise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less preferred) distributions. This perspective explains the emergence of separation in the latent space between safe and harmful prompts after alignment. As an application of our general divergence framework, we propose KLDO, a novel KL divergence-based alignment method, and empirically validate its effectiveness. We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard preference-based datasets, leads to stronger separation and improved safety alignment. Finally, to quantify the separation effect, we propose a distance-based metric in the prompt representation space, which also acts as a statistically significant indicator for model safety.</description>

      <title>Can We Validate Counterfactual Estimations in the Presence of General Network Interference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments have become a cornerstone of evidence-based decision-making in contexts ranging from online platforms to public health. However, in experimental settings with network interference, a unit's treatment can influence outcomes of other units, challenging both causal effect estimation and its validation. Classic validation approaches fail as outcomes are only observable under a single treatment scenario and exhibit complex correlation patterns due to interference. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework that facilitates the use of machine learning tools for both estimation and validation in causal inference. Central to our approach is the new distribution-preserving network bootstrap, a theoretically-grounded technique that generates multiple statistically-valid subpopulations from a single experiment's data. This amplification of experimental samples enables our second contribution: a counterfactual cross-validation procedure. This procedure adapts the principles of model validation to the unique constraints of causal settings, providing a rigorous, data-driven method for selecting and evaluating estimators. We extend recent causal message-passing developments by incorporating heterogeneous unit-level characteristics and varying local interactions, ensuring reliable finite-sample performance through non-asymptotic analysis. Additionally, we develop and publicly release a comprehensive benchmark toolbox featuring diverse experimental environments, from networks of interacting AI agents to ride-sharing applications. These environments provide known ground truth values while maintaining realistic complexities, enabling systematic evaluation of causal inference methods. Extensive testing across these environments demonstrates our method's robustness to diverse forms of network interference.</description>

      <title>Beyond Benign Overfitting in Nadaraya-Watson Interpolators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. In addition, for the purpose of tuning the hyperparameter, the results suggest that over-estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data is less harmful than under-estimating it. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems with Transformers: Approximation Bounds and Depth-Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards: GRPO's Effective Loss, Dynamics, and Success Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced and used recently for promoting reasoning in LLMs under verifiable (binary) rewards. We show that the mean + variance calibration of these rewards induces a weighted contrastive loss in which the contrastive samples are synthetic data drawn from the previous policy. While GRPO was originally paired with clipping to keep updates near the old policy, we analyze variants that differ in reward normalization (mean-only vs mean + variance) and in how they regularize updates using KL divergence: either penalizing divergence from the previous model (mirror), penalizing divergence from a fixed reference model $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}$, or combining both forms of regularization. For each, the optimal policy $\pi_n$ admits an explicit form in terms of the binary reward and the first and second order statistics of the reward under $\pi_{n-1}$, as well as the policies $\pi_{n-1}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}$. Iterating results in a sequence $\{\pi_n\}$ whose probability of success (PoS) obeys a simple recurrence that converges to a fixed point determined by the reference PoS and the regularization strength. We further show that this fixed point exceeds the reference, demonstrating that GRPO amplifies the policy's probability of success.</description>

      <title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10612v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art generative models map noise to data distributions by matching flows or scores. A key limitation of these models is their inability to readily integrate available partial observations and additional priors. In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs) address this by incorporating corresponding scalar energy terms. Here, we propose Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move from noise to data along irrotational, optimal transport paths. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize these dynamics with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. The present method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility of the method to introduce an interaction energy that supports the exploration of diverse modes, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein generation setting. This approach learns a scalar potential energy, without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks, marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe this simplified yet rigorous formulation significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling in diverse domains.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Framework for Turbulent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems can be computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatiotemporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks, for spatial dimension reduction, with an innovative recurrent architecture, inspired by large language models, to model long-range temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Since RBC exhibits turbulent behavior, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key physical features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Iterative Quantum Feature Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, the IQFMs framework effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that the IQFMs framework outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs framework achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model. The model consists of cathode, discharge, and plume sub-models and outputs thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster operating on krypton, the H9, and an unshielded thruster operating on xenon, the SPT-100, at pressures between 4.3--43 $\mu$Torr-Kr and 1.7--80 $\mu$Torr-Xe, respectively. After calibration, the model captures key pressure-related trends, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range of conditions. Compared to a previous model calibrated on some of the same data [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. These findings are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling in the presence of facility effects.</description>

      <title>TPP-SD: Accelerating Transformer Point Process Sampling with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$ speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid sequence sampling.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.</description>

      <title>Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification, whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments, highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.</description>
