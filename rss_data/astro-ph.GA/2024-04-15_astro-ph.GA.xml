      <title>Three-Body Binary Formation in Clusters: Analytical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary formation in clusters through triple encounters between three unbound stars, 'three-body' binary formation, is one of the main dynamical formation processes of binary systems in dense environments. In this paper, we use an analytical probabilistic approach to study the process for the equal mass case and calculate a probability distribution for the orbital parameters of three-body-formed binaries, as well as their formation rate. For the first time, we give closed-form analytical expressions to the full orbital parameter distribution, accounting for both energy and angular momentum conservation. This calculation relies on the sensitive dependence of the outcomes of three-body scatterings on the initial conditions: here we compute the rate of three-body binaries from ergodic interactions, which allow for an analytical derivation of the distribution of orbital parameters of the binaries thus created. We find that soft binaries are highly favoured in this process and that these binaries have a super-thermal eccentricity distribution, while the few hard three-body binaries have an eccentricity distribution much closer to thermal. The analytical results predict and reproduce simulation results of three-body scattering experiments in the literature well.</description>

      <title>Modeling Ionized Gas in the Small Magellanic Cloud: The Wolf-Rayet Nebula N76</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Cloudy modeling of infrared emission lines in the Wolf-Rayet (WR) nebula N76 caused by one of the most luminous and hottest WR stars in the low metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud. We use spatially resolved mid-infrared Spitzer/IRS and far-infrared Herschel/PACS spectroscopy to establish the physical conditions of the ionized gas. The spatially resolved distribution of the emission allows us to constrain properties much more accurately than using spatially integrated quantities. We construct models with a range of constant hydrogen densities between n$_H$ = 4 - 10 cm$^{-3}$ and a stellar wind-blown cavity of 10 pc which reproduces the intensity and shape of most ionized gas emission lines, including the high ionization lines [OIV] and [NeV], as well as [SIII], [SIV], [OIII], and [NeIII]. Our models suggest that the majority of [SiII] emission (91%) is produced at the edge of the HII region around the transition between ionized and atomic gas while very little of the [CII] emission (&lt;5%) is associated with the ionized gas. The physical conditions of N76 are characterized by a hot HII region with a maximum electron temperature of T$_e$ ~ 24,000 K, electron densities that range from n$_e$ ~ 4 to 12 cm$^{-3}$, and high ionization parameters of log(U) ~ -1.15 to -1.77. By analyzing a low metallicty WR nebula with a single ionization source, this work gives valuable insights on the impact WR stars have to the galaxy-integrated ionized gas properties in nearby dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Milky Way-est: Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Large Magellanic Cloud and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they: ($i$) are consistent with the MW's measured halo mass and concentration, ($ii$) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like ($\approx 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) subhalo within the last $1.3~\mathrm{Gyr}$ on a realistic orbit, placing them near $50~\mathrm{kpc}$ from the host center at $z\approx 0$, and ($iii$) undergo a $&gt;$1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times ($0.67&lt;z&lt;3$). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute $&lt; 1\%$ of all halos in the MW's mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain $22\%$ more subhalos with present-day virial masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches $\approx 80\%$ in the inner $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with $\approx 60\%$ of the total subhalo population within $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy's dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of $40+$ Microlensed Stars in a Magnified Galaxy, the "Dragon" behind Abell 370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational magnification by massive galaxy clusters enable us to detect faint background sources, resolve their detailed internal structures, and in the most extreme cases identify and study individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars allow for a wide range of applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining small-scale dark matter structures. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of events observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of 46 significant microlensed stars in a single strongly-lensed high-redshift galaxy behind the Abell 370 cluster at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed the ``Dragon arc''), based on two observations separated by one year with the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}). These events are mostly found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified individual stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry and colors, we constrain stellar types and find that many of them are consistent with red giants/supergiants magnified by factors of thousands. This finding reveals an unprecedented high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc, and proves that {\it JWST}'s time-domain observations open up the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars and subgalactic scale perturbations in the lensing dark matter field.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (&lt; yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at &lt;10 au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>Observational Tests of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback: An Overview of Approaches and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing supermassive black holes (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) release energy with the potential to alter their host galaxies and larger-scale environment; a process named "AGN feedback". Feedback is a required component of galaxy formation models and simulations to explain observed properties of galaxy populations. We provide a broad overview of observational approaches that are designed to establish the physical processes that couple AGN energy to the multi-phase gas, or to find evidence that AGN impact upon galaxy evolution. The orders-of-magnitude range in spatial, temporal, and temperature scales, requires a diverse set of observational studies. For example, studying individual targets in detail sheds light on coupling mechanisms; however, evidence for long-term impact of AGN is better established within galaxy populations that are not necessarily currently active. We emphasise how modern surveys have revealed the importance of radio emission for identifying, and characterising, feedback mechanisms. At the achieved sensitivities, the detected radio emission can trace a range of processes, including shocked interstellar medium caused by AGN outflows (driven by various mechanisms including radiation pressure, accretion disc winds, and jets). We also describe how interpreting observations in the context of theoretical work can be challenging, in part, due to some of the adopted terminology.</description>

      <title>Quiescent or dusty? Unveiling the nature of extremely red galaxies at $z&gt;3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the JWST has revolutionised our understanding of high-redshift galaxies. In particular, the NIRCam instrument on-board JWST has revealed a population of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-dark galaxies that had previously evaded optical detection, potentially due to significant dust obscuration, quiescence, or simply extreme redshift. Here, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of 23 HST-dark galaxies ($\mathrm{H-F444W&gt;1.75}$), unveiling their nature and physical properties. This sample includes both dusty and quiescent galaxies with spectroscopic data from NIRSpec/PRISM, providing accurate spectroscopic redshifts with $\mathrm{\overline{z}_{spec} = 4.1 \pm 0.7}$. The spectral features demonstrate that, while the majority of HST-dark galaxies are dusty, a substantial fraction, $\mathrm{13^{+9}_{-6} \%}$, are quiescent. For the dusty galaxies, we have quantified the dust attenuation using the Balmer decrement ($\mathrm{H\alpha / H\beta}$), finding attenuations $\mathrm{A_{V} &gt; 2\ mag}$. We find that HST-dark dusty galaxies are $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emitters with equivalent widths spanning the range $\mathrm{ 68 A &lt; EW_{H\alpha} &lt; 550 A }$, indicative of a wide range of recent star-formation activity. Whether dusty or quiescent, we find that HST-dark galaxies are predominantly massive, with 85\% of the galaxies in the sample having masses $\mathrm{log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 9.8}$. This pilot NIRSpec program reveals the diverse nature of HST-dark galaxies and highlights the effectiveness of NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic follow-up in distinguishing between dusty and quiescent galaxies and properly quantifying their physical properties. Upcoming research utilising higher-resolution NIRSpec data and combining JWST with ALMA observations will enhance our understanding of these enigmatic and challenging sources.</description>

      <title>Stellar Metallicities from DECam $u$-band Photometry: A Study of Milky Way Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an in-depth analysis of candidate member stars located in the peripheries of three ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy satellites of the Milky Way: Bo\"otes I (Boo1), Bo\"otes II (Boo2), and Segue I (Seg1). Studying these peripheral stars has previously been difficult due to contamination from the Milky Way foreground. We used $u$-band photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to derive metallicities to efficiently select UFD candidate member stars. This approach was validated on Boo1, where we identified both previously known and new candidate member stars beyond five half-light radii. We then applied a similar procedure to Boo2 and Seg1. Our findings hinted at evidence for tidal features in Boo1 and Seg1, with Boo1 having an elongation consistent with its proper motion and Seg1 showing some distant candidate stars, a few of which are along its elongation and proper motion. We find two Boo2 stars at large distances consistent with being candidate member stars. Using a foreground contamination rate derived from the \emph{Besan\c{c}on} Galaxy model, we ascribed purity estimates to each candidate member star. We recommend further spectroscopic studies on the newly identified high-purity members. Our technique offers promise for future endeavors to detect candidate member stars at large radii in other systems, leveraging metallicity-sensitive filters with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the new, narrow-band Ca HK filter on DECam.</description>

      <title>Birds of a Feather: Resolving Stellar Mass Assembly With JWST/NIRCam in a Pair of Kindred $z \sim 2$ Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Lensed by the PLCK G165.7+67.0 Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new parametric lens model for the G165.7+67.0 galaxy cluster, which was discovered with $Planck$ through its bright submillimeter flux, originating from a pair of extraordinary dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z\approx 2.2$. Using JWST and interferometric mm/radio observations, we characterize the intrinsic physical properties of the DSFGs, which are separated by only $\sim 1^{\prime\prime}$ (8 kpc) and a velocity difference $\Delta V \lesssim 600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the source plane, and thus likely undergoing a major merger. Boasting intrinsic star formation rates ${\rm SFR}_{\rm IR} = 320 \pm 70$ and $400 \pm 80~ M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, stellar masses ${\rm log}[M_\star/M_\odot] = 10.2 \pm 0.1$ and $10.3 \pm 0.1$, and dust attenuations $A_V = 1.5 \pm 0.3$ and $1.2 \pm 0.3$, they are remarkably similar objects. We perform spatially-resolved pixel-by-pixel SED fitting using rest-frame near-UV to near-IR imaging from JWST/NIRCam for both galaxies, resolving some stellar structures down to 100 pc scales. Based on their resolved specific SFRs and $UVJ$ colors, both DSFGs are experiencing significant galaxy-scale star formation events. If they are indeed interacting gravitationally, this strong starburst could be the hallmark of gas that has been disrupted by an initial close passage. In contrast, the host galaxy of the recently discovered triply-imaged SN H0pe has a much lower SFR than the DSFGs, and we present evidence for the onset of inside-out quenching and large column densities of dust even in regions of low specific SFR. Based on the intrinsic SFRs of the DSFGs inferred from UV through FIR SED modeling, this pair of objects alone is predicted to yield an observable $1.1 \pm 0.2~{\rm CCSNe~yr}^{-1}$, making this cluster field ripe for continued monitoring.</description>

      <title>Galactic Chemical Evolution Models Favor an Extended Type Ia Supernova Delay-Time Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial $t^{-1}$ power law.</description>

      <title>Microlensing near macro-caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing near macro-caustics is a complex phenomenon in which swarms of micro-images produced by micro-caustics form on both sides of a macro-critical curve. Recent discoveries of highly magnified images of individual stars in massive galaxy cluster lenses, predicted to be formed by these micro-image swarms, have stimulated studies on this topic. In this Chapter, we explore microlensing near macro-caustics using both simulations and analytic calculations. We show that the mean total magnification of the micro-image swarms follows that of an extended source in the absence of microlensing. Micro-caustics join into a connected network in a region around the macro-critical line of a width proportional to the surface density of microlenses; within this region, the increase of the mean magnification toward the macro-caustic is driven by the increase of the number of micro-images rather than individual magnifications of micro-images. The maximum achievable magnification in micro-caustic crossings decreases with the mass fraction in microlenses. We conclude with a review of applications of this microlensing phenomenon, including limits to the fraction of dark matter in compact objects, and searches of Population III stars and dark matter subhalos. We argue that the discovered highly magnified stars at cosmological distances already imply that less than $\sim$ 10\% of the dark matter may be in the form of compact objects with mass above $\sim 10^{-6}\, M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Studying Binary Formation under Dynamical Friction Using Hill's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the equations of motion from Hill's problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNi), considering both gas dynamical friction from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for gas and stellar dynamical friction. We perform extensive simulations of Hill's problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).</description>

      <title>Searching for Hyper-compact star clusters in the Milky Way using LAMOST and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the early merger of the Milky Way, intermediate-mass black holes in merged dwarf galaxies may have been ejected from the center of their host galaxies due to gravitational waves, carrying some central stars along. This process can lead to the formation of hyper-compact star clusters, potentially hosting black holes in the mass range of $10^4$ to $10^5$ solar masses. These clusters are crucial targets for identifying and investigating intermediate-mass black holes. However, no hyper-compact star clusters in the Milky Way have been identified so far. In this paper, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution power of Gaia, we used data from Gaia EDR3 and LAMOST DR7, along with additional data from Pan-STARRS and SDSS, to conduct an initial screening of 6,138,049 sources using various parameters of Gaia EDR3. A total of 4,786 sources were selected for in-depth analysis. Each of these sources was meticulously scrutinized by examining their images, spectra, and nearby celestial objects to exclude various false positives, such as contaminations, galaxies, wide binaries, or wrong matches. We finally identified one likely hyper-compact star cluster candidate in the Milky Way, laying the foundation for further high-resolution imaging and spectral verification.</description>

      <title>21cm signal from Dark Ages collapsing halos with detailed molecular cooling treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In order to understand the formation of the first stars, which set the transition between the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs, it is necessary to provide a detailed description of the physics at work within the first clouds of gas which, during their gravitational collapse, will set the conditions for stars to be form through the mechanism of thermal instability.
  Aims. Our objective is to study in detail the molecular cooling of gas in the halos preceding the formation of the first stars. We are furthermore assessing the sensitivity of the 21cm hydrogen line to this cooling channel.
  Results. We present the CHEMFAST code, that we developed to compute the cosmological 21cm neutral hydrogen line inside collapsing matter overdensity. We precisely track evolution in the abundances of ions, atoms and molecules through a network of chemical reactions. Computing the molecular thermal function due to the excitation of the rotational levels of the H2 molecule, we find it strongly affects the gas temperature inside collapsing clouds of $10^8$ M$_\odot$. The gas temperature falls at the end of the collapse, when the molecular cooling takes over the heating due to gravitation.
  Conclusions. We find that the 21cm brightness temperature inside the collapsing cloud presents an emission feature, different from the one predicted in expansion scenario. It moreover follows the same behavior as the gas temperature, as it is also strongly affected by the molecular cooling. This makes it a promising probe in order to map the collapsing halos and thermal processes at work inside them.</description>

      <title>Imaging dark matter at the smallest scales with lensed stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7&lt;z&lt;1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\beta&gt;2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\beta&lt;2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^8\,\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <title>Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids Observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Provide a New Anchor for the SH0ES Distance Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric measurements of 88 Cepheid variables in the core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the first sample obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Wide Field Camera 3, in the same homogeneous photometric system as past measurements of all Cepheids on the SH0ES distance ladder. We limit the sample to the inner core and model the geometry to reduce errors in prior studies due to the non-trivial depth of this Cloud. Without crowding present in ground-based studies, we obtain an unprecedentedly low dispersion of 0.102 mag for a Period-Luminosity relation in the SMC, approaching the width of the Cepheid instability strip. The new geometric distance to 15 late-type detached eclipsing binaries in the SMC offers a rare opportunity to improve the foundation of the distance ladder, increasing the number of calibrating galaxies from three to four. With the SMC as the only anchor, we find H$_0\!=\!74.1 \pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Combining these four geometric distances with our HST photometry of SMC Cepheids, we obtain H$_0\!=\!73.17 \pm 0.86$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. By including the SMC in the distance ladder, we also double the range where the metallicity ([Fe/H]) dependence of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation can be calibrated, and we find $\gamma = -0.22 \pm 0.05$ mag dex$^{-1}$. Our local measurement of H$_0$ based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae shows a 5.8$\sigma$ tension with the value inferred from the CMB assuming a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, reinforcing the possibility of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Galaxy Clustering Constraints With Cross-Bin Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering studies in current photometric galaxy surveys focus solely on auto-correlations, neglecting cross-correlations between redshift bins. We evaluate the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating cross-bin correlations in Fisher forecasts for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Our analysis considers the impact of including redshift space distortions (RSD) and magnification in model predictions, as well as systematic uncertainties in photometric redshift distributions (photo-$z$). While auto-correlations alone suffer from a degeneracy between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) and galaxy bias parameters, accounting for RSD and magnification in cross-correlations helps break this degeneracy - although more weakly than the degeneracy breaking expected from a combined analysis with other observables. Incorporating cross-bin correlations does not significantly increase sensitivity to photo-$z$ systematics, addressing previous concerns, and self-calibrates photo-$z$ systematics, reducing errors on photo-$z$ nuisance parameters. We suggest that the benefits of including cross-correlations in future photometric galaxy clustering analyses outweigh the risks, but caution that careful evaluation is necessary as more realistic pictures of surveys' precision and systematic error budgets develop.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Young Stellar Populations in NGC 1783: Accretion of External Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multi-epoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster, and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically-Correct Implicit-Explicit Time Integration Scheme for Finite Volume Radiation-Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) for non-relativistic flows is a challenging problem because it encompasses processes acting over a very broad range of timescales, and where the relative importance of these processes often varies by orders of magnitude across the computational domain. Here we present a new implicit-explicit (IMEX) method for numerical RHD that has a number of desirable properties that have not previously been combined in a single method. Our scheme is based on moments and allows machine-precision conservation of energy and momentum, making it highly suitable for adaptive mesh refinement applications; it requires no more communication than hydrodynamics and includes no non-local iterative steps, making it highly suitable for massively parallel and GPU-based systems where communication is a bottleneck; and we show that it is asymptotically-accurate in the streaming, static diffusion, and dynamic diffusion limits, including in the so-called asymptotic diffusion regime where the computational grid does not resolve the photon mean free path. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and show that it passes a wide range of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Insights into the 21 cm field from the vanishing cross-power spectrum at the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stages of the Epoch of Reionization, probed by the 21 cm line, are sensitive to the detailed properties and formation histories of the first galaxies. We use 21cmFAST and a simple, self-consistent galaxy model to examine the redshift evolution of the large-scale cross-power spectrum between the 21 cm field and line-emitting galaxies. A key transition in redshift occurs when the 21 cm field shifts from being positively correlated with the galaxy distribution to being negatively correlated. Importantly, this transition redshift is insensitive to the properties of the galaxy tracers but depends sensitively on the thermal and ionization histories traced through the 21 cm field. Specifically, we show that the transition occurs when both ionization fluctuations dominate over 21 cm spin temperature fluctuations and when the average spin temperature exceeds the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. We illustrate this with three different 21 cm models which have largely the same neutral fraction evolution but different heating histories. We find that the transition redshift has a scale dependence, and that this can help disentangle the relative importance of heating and ionization fluctuations. The best prospects for constraining the transition redshift occur in scenarios with late X-ray heating, where the transition occurs at redshifts as low as $z \sim 6-8$. In our models, this requires high-redshift galaxy surveys with sensitivities of $\sim 10^{-18}~\rm erg/s/cm^2$ for optical lines and $\sim 10^{-19}~\rm erg/s/cm^2$ for FIR lines. Future measurements of the transition redshift can help discriminate between 21 cm models and will benefit from reduced systematics.</description>

Abstract: One of the XRISM mission goals is to measure the gas dynamics of galaxy clusters with Resolve spectroscopy. To archive these, we propose an observation of the X-ray bright galaxy cluster Abell 2256 at z=0.06. This hosts 2nd brightest diffuse radio relic. Suzaku revealed a gas bulk motion at 1500 km/s, for the first time i\ n a cluster. This X-ray gas velocity is consistent with those measured in galaxy velocities, indicating that gas and galaxies are moving together. These and other observations make this system the most suitable for the XRISM spectral mapping of gas bulk and tur\ bulent motions and related physics. We propose two pointings to cover the central ~400kpc region.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>

Abstract: The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to gather the abundances of neutron-capture elements but also of light elements and iron peak elements in a large sample of giant stars in this metallicity range. T The aim of this work is to study the chemical evolution of galactic sub-components recently identified (i.e. Gaia Sausage Enceladus (GSE), Sequoia). We used high signal-to-noise ratios, high-resolution spectra and standard 1D LTE spectrum synthesis to determine the detailed abundances. We could determine the abundances for up to 10 neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu) in 33 stars. The general trends of abundance ratios [n-capture element/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are in agreement with the results found in the literature. When our sample is divided in sub-groups depending on their kinematics, we found that the run of [Sr/Ba] vs [Ba/H] for the stars belonging to the GSE accretion event shows a tight anti-correlation. The results for the Sequoia stars, although based on a very limited sample, shows a [Sr/Ba] systematically higher than the [Sr/Ba] found in the GSE stars at a given [Ba/H] hinting at a different nucleosynthetic history. Stochastic chemical evolution models have been computed to understand the evolution of the GSE chemical composition of Sr and Ba. The first conclusions are that the GSE chemical evolution is similar to the evolution of a dwarf galaxy with galactic winds and inefficient star formation.
  Detailed abundances of neutron-capture elements have been measured in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of intermediate metal-poor stars, the metallicity range covered by the MINCE project. These abundances have been compared to detailed stochastic models of galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Fast giant flares in discs around supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\alpha$ discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares. On calculating discs structures, we compute the critical points of stability curves for discs around SMBH, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape of a $\xi$ curve. We find that there are values of the disc parameters that favour the transition of a disc ring from a recombined cool state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state with higher viscosity parameter $\alpha$. For SMBH with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8 M_\odot$, such a flare can occur in the geometrically thin and optically thick neutral disc with convective energy transfer through the disc thickness surrounding a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. When self-gravity effects are negligible, the duration of a flare and the associated mass exhibit a positive correlation with the truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc prior to the flare. According to our rough estimates, $\sim 4-3000 M_\odot$ can be involved in a giant flare, i.e. can be accreted or entrained with an outflow lasting 1 to 400 years, if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii in a disc around SMBH with $10^7 M_\odot$. The accretion rate on SMBH peaks at a super-Eddington value about ten times faster. The peak effective disc temperature at the trigger radius is $\sim 10^5\,$K, but it can be obscured by an optically thick outflow that reprocesses the emission to longer wavelengths. Such a transfer of disc state could trigger a massive outburst, similar to that following a tidal disruption event.</description>

Abstract: Massive binary evolution models are needed to predict massive star populations in star forming galaxies, the supernova diversity, and the number and properties of gravitational wave sources. Such models are often computed using so called rapid binary evolution codes, which approximate the evolution of the binary components based on detailed single star models. However, about one third of the interacting massive binary stars undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning (Case A mass transfer), whose outcome is difficult to derive from single star models. Here, we use a large grid of detailed binary evolution models for primaries in the initial mass range 10 to 40 Solar masses of LMC and SMC composition, to derive analytic fits for the key quantities needed in rapid binary evolution codes, i.e., the duration of core hydrogen burning, and the resulting donor star mass. Systems with shorter orbital periods produce up to 50% lighter stripped donors and have a up to 30% larger lifetime than wider systems. We find that both quantities depend strongly on the initial binary orbital period, but that the initial mass ratio and the mass transfer efficiency of the binary have little impact on the outcome. Our results are easily parameterisable and can be used to capture the effects of Case A mass transfer more accurately in rapid binary evolution codes.</description>

      <title>The role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration in the inner jets of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multi-wavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma-ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multi-wavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker-Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multi-wavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multi-zone, broadband emission modelling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Supermassive Dark Stars with the Roman Space Telescope</title>

Abstract: The first bright objects to form in the Universe at redshift $z \sim 10-20$ might have been Dark Stars, made primarily of hydrogen and helium but powered by dark matter. In this study, we investigate the detectability of Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDS) by the Roman Space Telescope. RST will be able to detect SMDSs at redshifts as high as $z\simeq 14$. In cases with gravitational lensing factors of $\mu\sim 100$, RST will be able to find SMDS as small as $\sim10^4 M_{\odot}$ at $z\sim 12$ with $\sim 10^6$ s of exposure. To differentiate SMDS from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts, we compare their spectra, photometry in RST bands, color indexes and image morphology. With RST alone, the differentiation is possible only for limited cases: SMDS formed via "adiabatic contraction" (DM pulled into the star via gravity alone) with $M\gtrsim 10^5M_{\odot}$ and lensed by $\mu\gtrsim 30$ have distinct photometric signatures from those of the first galaxies. For SMDSs formed via "dark matter capture," their spectra are degenerate to those of many galaxies with little to no nebular emission. Thus with RST alone, the only way to tell them apart from first galaxies would be via image morphology: i.e. point object (SMDSs) vs. extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). However, if the same objects are further examined by JWST spectroscopy, a "smoking gun" for detection of SMDS is the HeII $\lambda$1640 absorption line. While RST does not cover the wavelength band required to find this line (for $z_{\rm emi}\gtrsim 10$), JWST does. Hence the two detectors can be used together in identifying SMDS. The confirmed detection of any SMDSs will provide evidence for a new type of star, powered by dark matter. Moreover, such massive stars can also be natural progenitors of the supermassive black holes powering the extremely bright quasars observed at $z\gtrsim 6$.</description>

      <title>TREASUREHUNT: Transients and Variability Discovered with HST in the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) is a $&gt;$14 arcmin diameter field optimized for multi-wavelength time-domain science with JWST. It has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum both from the ground and from space, including with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As part of HST observations over 3 cycles (the "TREASUREHUNT" program), deep images were obtained with ACS/WFC in F435W and F606W that cover almost the entire JWST NEP TDF. Many of the individual pointings of these programs partially overlap, allowing an initial assessment of the potential of this field for time-domain science with HST and JWST. The cumulative area of overlapping pointings is ~88 arcmin$^2$, with time intervals between individual epochs that range between 1 day and 4$+$ years. To a depth of $m_{AB}$ $\simeq$ 29.5 mag (F606W), we present the discovery of 12 transients and 190 variable candidates. For the variable candidates, we demonstrate that Gaussian statistics are applicable, and estimate that ~80 are false positives. The majority of the transients will be supernovae, although at least two are likely quasars. Most variable candidates are AGN, where we find 0.42% of the general $z$ $&lt;$ 6 field galaxy population to vary at the $~3\sigma$ level. Based on a 5-year timeframe, this translates into a random supernova areal density of up to ~0.07 transients per arcmin$^2$ (~245 deg$^{-2}$) per epoch, and a variable AGN areal density of ~1.25 variables per arcmin$^2$ (~4500 deg$^{-2}$) to these depths.</description>

      <title>Convergence Tests of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theory predicts that dark matter halos experience core-collapse, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. The N-body simulations used to study this process can suffer from numerical errors when simulation parameters are selected incorrectly. Optimal choices for simulation parameters are well studied for cold dark matter (CDM), but are not deeply understood when self-interactions are included. In order to perform reliable N-body simulations and model core-collapse accurately we must understand the potential numerical errors, how to diagnose them, and what parameter selections must be made to reduce them. We use the \texttt{Arepo} N-body code to perform convergence tests of core-collapsing SIDM halos across a range of halo concentrations and SIDM cross-sections, and quantify potential numerical issues related to mass resolution, timestep size, and gravitational softening length. Our tests discover that halos with fewer than $10^5$ simulation particles, a resolution typically not met by subhalos in N-body simulations, suffer from significant discreteness noise that leads to variation and extreme outliers in the collapse rate. At our lowest resolution of $N=10^4$ particles, this collapse time variation can reach as high as 20\%. At this low resolution we also find a bias in collapse times and a small number of extreme outliers. Additionally, we find that simulations which run far beyond the age of the Universe, which have been used to calibrate SIDM gravothermal fluid models in previous work, have a sensitivity to the timestep size that is not present in shorter simulations or simulations using only CDM. Our work shows that choices of simulation parameters that yield converged results for some halo masses and SIDM models do not necessarily yield convergence for others.</description>

      <title>Multiphase gas in elliptical galaxies: the role of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive elliptical galaxies harbor large amounts of hot gas ($T\gtrsim10^6~\mathrm{K}$) in their interstellar medium (ISM) but are typically quiescent in star formation. Active-galactic nuclei (AGNs) jets and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) inject energy into the ISM which offsets its radiative losses and keeps it hot. SNIa deposit their energy locally within the galaxy compared to the larger few$\times10~\mathrm{kpc}$-scale AGN jets. In this study, we perform high-resolution ($512^3$) hydrodynamic simulations of a local ($1~\mathrm{kpc}^3$) density-stratified patch of massive galaxies' ISM. We include radiative cooling and shell-averaged volume heating, as well as randomly exploding SNIa. We study the effect of different fractions of supernova heating (with respect to the net cooling rate), different initial ISM density/entropy (which controls the thermal-instability growth time $t_\mathrm{ti}$) and different degrees of stratification (which affects the free-fall time $t_\mathrm{ff}$). We find that the SNIa drive predominantly compressive turbulence in the ISM with a velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ up to $40~\mathrm{km}s^{-1}$ and logarithmic density dispersion $\sigma_s\sim0.2$--$0.4$. These fluctuations trigger multiphase condensation in regions of the ISM where $\min(t_\mathrm{ti})/t_\mathrm{ff}\lesssim 0.6\exp(6 \sigma_s)$, in agreement with theoretical expectations that large density fluctuations efficiently trigger multiphase gas formation. Since the SNIa rate is not self-adjusting, when the net cooling drops below the net heating rate the SNIa drive a hot wind which sweeps out most of the mass in our local model. Global simulations are required to assess the ultimate fate of this gas.</description>

      <title>An X-ray Census of Active Galactic Nuclei in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters of Galaxies with SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a uniform and sensitive X-ray census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the two nearest galaxy clusters, Virgo and Fornax, utilizing the newly released X-ray source catalogs from the first all-sky scan of SRG/eROSITA. A total of 50 and 10 X-ray sources are found positionally coincident with the nuclei of member galaxies in Virgo and Fornax, respectively, down to a 0.2-2.3 keV luminosity of $\sim10^{39}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and reaching out to a projected distance well beyond the virial radius of both clusters. The majority of the nuclear X-ray sources are newly identified. There is weak evidence that the nuclear X-ray sources are preferentially found in late-type hosts. Several hosts are dwarf galaxies with a stellar mass below $\sim10^{9}\rm~M_\odot$. We find that contamination by non-nuclear X-ray emission can be neglected in most cases, indicating the dominance of a genuine AGN. In the meantime, no nuclear X-ray source exhibits a luminosity higher than a few times $10^{41}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The X-ray AGN occupation rate is only $\sim$ 3% in both clusters, apparently much lower than that in field galaxies inferred from previous X-ray studies. Both aspects suggest that the cluster environment effectively suppresses AGN activity. The findings of this census have important implications on the interplay between galaxies and their central massive black holes in cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dust torus size-luminosity relation based on a uniform reverberation mapping analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the torus size -- luminosity relation of Type 1 AGNs based on the reverberation-mapping analysis using the light curves of the optical continuum and the IR continuum obtained with the W1 and W2-bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey. The final sample consists of 446 and 416 AGNs, respectively, for W1 and W2-band light curves, covering a large dynamic range of bolometric luminosity from $10^{43.4}$ to $10^{47.6}$ $erg \, s^{-1}$, which show reliable lag measurements based on our quality assessment analysis. After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size ($R_{dust}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1- (W2-) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K-band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as $R_{dust,K}:R_{dust,W1}:R_{dust,W2}$ = 1.0:1.5:1.8 ($R_{dust} \, \propto \, \lambda^{0.80}$) at $L_{bol}$ = $10^{46} \, erg \, s^{-1}$, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size -- luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relationship.</description>

      <title>Overmassive black holes at cosmic noon: linking the local and the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report for the first time a sample of 12 supermassive black holes (SMBHs) hosted by low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon, i.e., in a redshift range consistent with the peak of star formation history: $z \sim 1-3$. These black holes are two orders of magnitude too massive for the stellar content of their hosts when compared with the local relation for active galaxies. These overmassive systems at cosmic noon share similar properties with the high-$z$ sources found ubiquitously in recent \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) surveys (same range of black hole-to-stellar mass ratio, bolometric luminosity, and Eddington ratio). We argue that black hole feedback processes, for which there is possible evidence in five of the sources, and the differing environments in galactic nuclei at these respective epochs play a key role in these overmassive systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the growth and co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies across cosmic time, offering a link between the early Universe ($z &gt; 4$) observed by \textit{JWST} and observations of the present-day Universe ($z \lesssim 1$).</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the impact and signature of black holes from different origins in early cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization ($z\gtrsim 6$). We consider PBHs floating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and located inside haloes, where star formation can occur. For stars with a mass $\gtrsim 25 \rm\ M_{\odot}$, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). Since SRBHs also accrete material from their surroundings, we consider them to have similar radiation feedback as PBHs in the halo environment. To estimate the background radiation level more accurately, we take into account the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing an improved modeling of the halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that at $z\gtrsim 30$, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, the accretion feedback power from haloes dominates. We also analyze the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED), and break it down into select wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$, the H-ionizing and Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the IGM. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could account for the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.</description>

      <title>Hot Gas Outflow Properties of the Starburst Galaxy NGC 4945</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 330 ks of {\it Chandra} X-ray imaging and spectra of the nearby, edge-on starburst and Seyfert Type 2 galaxy NGC 4945 to measure the hot gas properties along the galactic outflows. We extract and model spectra from 15 regions extending from $-$0.55 kpc to $+$0.85 kpc above and below the galactic disk to determine the best-fit parameters and metal abundances. We find that the hot gas temperatures and number densities peak in the central regions and decrease along the outflows. These profiles are inconsistent with a spherical, adiabatically-expanding wind model, suggesting the need to include mass loading and/or a non-spherical outflow geometry. We estimate the mass outflow rate of the hot wind to be $1.6\:M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Emission from charge exchange is detected in the northern outflow, and we estimate it contributes 12\% to the emitted, broad-band ($0.5-7$ keV) X-ray flux.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas.
