      <title>Geometry and Analysis of Gradient Ricci Solitons in Dimension Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Dedicated to Richard S. Hamilton on forty years of Ricci flow] Gradient Ricci solitons have garnered significant attention both as self-similar solutions and singularity models of the Ricci flow. This survey article starts with a list of examples; it also provides some geometric aspects of gradient Ricci solitons, including various asymptotic behaviors; finally, it discusses some recent results on classification and rigidity. In particular, this survey focuses on dimension four.</description>

      <title>Partial Dirac structures in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the notion of Dirac structure in finite dimension is extended to the convenient setting. In particular, we introduce the notion of partial Dirac structure on convenient Lie algebroids and manifolds. We then look for those structures whose classical geometrical results in finite dimension can be extended to this infinite dimensional context. Finally, we are interested in the projective and direct limits of such structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Marques-Neves in arXiv:2103.10093, and several alternative formulations thereof, about the stability of the min-max width of three-spheres under the additional assumption of rotational symmetry. We can moreover extend our results to all dimensions $n\geqslant 3$.</description>

      <title>Arcs, stability of pairs and the Mabuchi functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove various results involving arcs - which generalise test configurations - within the theory of K-stability.
  Our main result characterises coercivity of the Mabuchi functional on spaces of Fubini-Study metrics in terms of uniform K-polystability with respect to arcs, thereby proving a version of a conjecture of Tian. The main new tool is an arc version of a numerical criterion for Paul's theory of stability of pairs, for which we also provide a suitable generalisation applicable to pairs with nontrivial stabiliser.
  We give two applications. Firstly, we give a new proof of a version of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for Fano manifolds, along the lines originally envisaged by Tian - allowing us to reduce the general Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture to an analogue of the partial C^0-estimate. Secondly, for a (possibly singular) polarised variety which is uniformly K-polystable with respect to arcs, we show that the associated Cartan subgroup of its automorphism group is reductive. In particular, uniform K-stability with respect to arcs implies finiteness of the automorphism group. This generalises work of Blum-Xu for Fano varieties.</description>

Abstract: On the analytic side, we prove the quantum ergodicity (QE) of Hamiltonian operators on certain series of unitary flat bundles, using mixed quantization techniques.

Abstract: We provide relationships between the spectral convergences in B\'erard-Besson-Gallot sense, in Kasue-Kumura sense and the measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, for compact finite dimensional RCD spaces. As an independent interest, a canonical (spectral) approximation map between such spaces constructed by given spectral data is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the orthogonal projection of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for a given view direction. We then introduce and investigate several invariants of the families of the plane curves that locally configure the projection image of the surface. Using the invariants, we also show an extension of the d'Ocagne formula that associates a local behavior of the projection image of a surface with Gaussian curvature of the surface.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert--Mumford criterion for nilsolitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebraic criterion for a nilpotent real Lie algebra and prove that it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the associated nilpotent Lie group to admit left-invariant Ricci solitons, called nilsolitons. As an application of this result, we generalise Nikolayevsky's criterion for the existence of nilsolitons to nilpotent Lie algebras without nice bases. We further prove a modified version of the Taketomi--Tamaru conjecture for nilpotent Lie groups which gives an obstruction to the existence of nilsolitons.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras associated to connections on spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra which arises in the physics literature on supergravity to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and squaring map, and also allowing for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples of such algebras on higher-dimensional spheres. We demonstrate that the definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle -- provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres -- and obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first demonstrate that the area preserving mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces in space forms exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a round sphere if the integral of the traceless second fundamental form is sufficiently small. Then we show that from sufficiently large initial coordinate sphere, the area preserving mean curvature flow exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a constant mean curvature surface in 3-dimensional asymptotically Schwarzschild spaces. This provides a new approach to the existence of foliation established by Huisken and Yau. And also a uniqueness result follows</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>Hypertoric varieties, $W$-Hilbert schemes, and Coulomb branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems for conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental theorem of Liouville asserts that positive entire harmonic functions in Euclidean spaces must be constant. A remarkable Liouville-type theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck states that positive entire solutions of $-\Delta u=u^{ {(n+2)}/{(n-2)} }$, $n\ge 3$, are unique modulo M\"obius transformations. Far-reaching extensions were established for general fully nonlinear conformally invariant equations through the works of Chang-Gursky-Yang, Li-Li, Li, and Viaclovsky. In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of such Liouville-type theorems. This leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for local gradient estimates of solutions to hold, assuming a one-sided bound on the solutions, for a wide class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations involving Schouten tensors. A pivotal advancement in proving these Liouville-type theorems is our enhanced understanding of solutions to such equations near isolated singularities. In particular, we utilize earlier results of Caffarelli-Li-Nirenberg on lower- and upper-conical singularities. For general conformally invariant fully nonlinear elliptic equations, we prove that a viscosity super- (sub-)solution can be extended across an isolated singularity if and only if it is a lower- (upper-)conical singularity. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for lower- (upper-)conical behavior of a function near isolated singularities in terms of its conformal Hessian.
  As an application of our Liouville theorems and local gradient estimates, we establish new existence and compactness results for conformal metrics on a closed Riemannian manifold with prescribed symmetric functions of the Schouten (Ricci) tensor, allowing the scalar curvature of the conformal metrics to have varying signs.</description>
