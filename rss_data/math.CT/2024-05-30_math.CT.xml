      <title>Rank functions on \((d+2)\)-angulated categories -- a functorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a rank function on a \((d+2)\)-angulated category \(\CC\) which generalises the notion of a rank function on a triangulated category. Inspired by work of Chuang and Lazarev, for \(d\) an odd positive integer, we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions defined on objects in \(\CC\) and rank functions defined on morphisms in \(\CC\). Inspired by work of Conde, Gorsky, Marks and Zvonareva, for \(d\) an odd positive integer, we show there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions on \(\proj A\) and additive functions on \(\mod(\proj A)\), where \(\proj A\) is endowed with the Amiot-Lin \((d+2)\)-angulated category structure. This allows us to show that every integral rank function on \(\proj A\) can be decomposed into irreducible rank functions.</description>

      <title>Groupoidal Realizability for Intensional Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop realizability models of intensional type theory, based on groupoids, wherein realizers themselves carry non-trivial (non-discrete) homotopical structure. In the spirit of realizability, this is intended to formalize a homotopical BHK interpretation, whereby evidence for an identification is a path. Specifically, we study partitioned groupoidal assemblies. Categories of such are parameterised by "realizer categories" (instead of the usual partial combinatory algebras) that come equipped with an interval qua internal cogroupoid. The interval furnishes a notion of homotopy as well as a fundamental groupoid construction. Objects in a base groupoid are realized by points in the fundamental groupoid of some object from the realizer category; isomorphisms in the base groupoid are realized by paths in said fundamental groupoid. The main result is that, under mild conditions on the realizer category, the ensuing category of partitioned groupoidal assemblies models intensional (1-truncated) type theory without function extensionality. Moreover, when the underlying realizer category is "untyped", there exists an impredicative universe of 1-types (the modest fibrations). This is a groupoidal analogue of the traditional situation.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

      <title>The elementary theory of the 2-category of small categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary description of $2$-categories $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ of internal categories, functors and natural transformations, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a category modelling Lawvere's elementary theory of the category of sets (ETCS). This extends Bourke's characterisation of $2$-categories $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ where $\mathcal{E}$ has pullbacks to take account for the extra properties in ETCS, and Lawvere's characterisation of the (one dimensional) category of small categories to take account of the two-dimensional structure. Important two-dimensional concepts which we introduce include $2$-well-pointedness, full-subobject classifiers, and the categorified axiom of choice. Along the way, we show how generating families (resp. orthogonal factorisation systems) on $\mathcal{E}$ give rise to generating families (resp. orthogonal factorisation systems) on $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)_{1}$, results which we believe are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Semiframes: algebras of heterogeneous consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semitopologies model consensus in distributed system by equating the notion of a quorum -- a set of participants sufficient to make local progress -- with that of an open set. This yields a topology-like theory of consensus, but semitopologies generalise topologies, since the intersection of two quorums need not necessarily be a quorum. The semitopological model of consensus is naturally heterogeneous and local, just like topologies can be heterogenous and local, and for the same reasons: points may have different quorums and there is no restriction that open sets / quorums be uniformly generated (e.g. open sets can be something other than two-thirds majorities of the points in the space).
  Semiframes are an algebraic abstraction of semitopologies. They are to semitopologies as frames are to topologies. We give a notion of semifilter, which plays a role analogous to filters, and show how to build a semiframe out of the open sets of a semitopology, and a semitopology out of the semifilters of a semiframe.
  We define suitable notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and investigate well-behavedness properties on semitopologies and semiframes across the duality. Surprisingly, the structure of semiframes is not what one might initially expect just from looking at semitopologies, and the canonical structure required for the duality result -- a compatibility relation *, generalising sets intersection -- is also canonical for expressing well-behavedness properties.
  Overall, we deliver a new categorical, algebraic, abstract framework within which to study consensus on distributed systems, and which is also simply interesting to consider as a mathematical theory in its own right.</description>
