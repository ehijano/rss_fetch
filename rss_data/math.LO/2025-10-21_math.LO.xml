      <title>A transformal transcendence result for algebraic difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an algebraic difference equation of the form \[\sigma^n(y)=f\big(y, \sigma(y),\dots,\sigma^{n-1}(y)\big)\] where $f$ is a rational function over a field $k$ of characteristic zero on which $\sigma$ acts trivially, it is shown that if there is a nontrivial algebraic relation amongst any number of $\sigma$-disjoint solutions, along with their $\sigma$-transforms, then there is already such a relation between three solutions. Here ``$\sigma$-disjoint" means $a\neq\sigma^r(b)$ for any integer $r$. A weaker version of the theorem, where ``three" is replaced by $n+4$, is also obtained when $\sigma$ acts non-trivially on $k$. Along the way a number of other structural results about primitive rational dynamical systems are established. These theorems are deduced as applications of a detailed model-theoretic study of finite-rank quantifier-free types in the theory of existentially closed difference fields of characteristic zero. In particular, it is also shown that the degree of non-minimality of such types over fixed-field parameters is bounded by $2$.</description>

      <title>T-Convexity, Tame Extensions and Definability of Hausdorff Limits in O-minimal Structures with Generic Derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the combination of two o-minimal extensions of the theory of real closed fields: one by a T-convex subring and the other by a T-derivation. Let T be a complete, model complete o-minimal extension of RCF. We show that the combined theory T_convex^delta has a model completion T_g,convex^delta. By adding a definable unary function st, we obtain a relative quantifier elimination result for tame pairs (M, delta^M, st^M, N, delta^N, st^N), where st is the standard part map and N is Dedekind complete in M. As an application, we prove the stable embedding property for tame pairs of T_g^delta. We also associate a sequence of definable metric topologies with models of T_g^delta and prove the Marker-Steinhorn Theorem for T_g^delta. As a consequence, Hausdorff limits of definable families are definable. A special case of our framework recovers Borotta's results on CODF with convex valuation subrings and tame pairs.</description>

      <title>On the Contingency of Logic in Possible World Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the contingency of logic within the framework of possible world semantics. Possible world semantics captures the meaning of necessitation, i.e., a statement is necessarily true if it holds in all possible worlds. Standard Kripkean semantics assumes that all possible worlds are governed by one single logic. We relax this assumption and introduce mixed models, in which different worlds may obey different logical systems. The paper provides a first case study where we mix classical propositional logic ($\mathsf{CPC}$) and intuitionistic propositional logic ($\mathsf{IPC}$) in the possible world semantics. We define the class of mixed models $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}(\mathsf{CPC}, \mathsf{IPC})$, together with a subclass of concrete mixed models ($\mathcal{CMM}$), and establish their semantic properties. Our main result shows that the set of formulas valid in $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}(\mathsf{CPC}, \mathsf{IPC})$ corresponds exactly to the intuitionistic modal logic $\mathsf{iK}$ extended with the Box Excluded Middle axiom ($\mathsf{iK} + \mathsf{bem}$). To demonstrate this, we prove soundness and completeness results linking $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}(\mathsf{CPC}, \mathsf{IPC})$ and $\mathcal{CMM}$, and birelational models for $\mathsf{iK} + \mathsf{bem}$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey regularity implies no MAD families without uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if the Ramsey property holds (in a class of sets), then there is no MAD family (in this class, provided it satisfies some modest closure properties), proving a conjecture made by A.R.D.\ Mathias in 1977. As the technique we introduce for this proof is useful in a variety of related problems, we take the opportunity to announce 4 theorems, which will be proved in a follow-up paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for every Coxeter diagram $D$ with no rank $3$ residues of spherical type and such that $D$ has not only edges labelled by $2$, the space of countable (Tits) buildings of type $D$ is Borel complete, that is, classifying countable buildings of type $D$ up to isomorphism is as hard as classifying countable graphs up to isomorphism. In particular, for every $n\geq 3$, the space of countable generalised $n$-gons is Borel complete.</description>

      <title>Generalized functions with infinitesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a survey of the use of infinitesimals within mathematical analysis to rigorously deal with the delta-function from physics, and more generally, with distributions in the sense of L. Schwartz. We use the framework of nonstandard analysis as introduced by A. Robinson to rigorously deal with infinitesimals. Our exposition tries to be elementary, except for familiarity with nonstandard analysis, and takes as a starting point one of the basic questions in PDE for which distribution theory was developed. No knowledge of distribution theory is required.</description>

      <title>First-order definability of Campana Points and Darmon Points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give first-order definitions of Campana and Darmon points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields. These sets are geometric generalizations of $n$-full integers (integers whose nonzero valuations are at least $n$) and perfect $n$th powers, respectively, to more general algebraic varieties. For this we exploit the theory of quadratic Pfister forms, which were used by Becher, Daans &amp; Dittmann to extend to the case of algebraic function fields in one variable the methods used by Koenigsmann when proving that $\mathbb{Z}$ is universally defined in $\mathbb{Q}$. These methods had already been generalized to arbitrary global fields by Park (2013) and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison (2018), and the author had already exploited these methods to find first-order definitions of Campana points (2024) and Darmon points (2024, with Handley) in the context of number fields. With the newly expanded version of these methods, we now transfer those results to the new context of algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields.</description>

      <title>Generic sampling and invariant measures on the space of $k$-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a model-theoretic representation theorem for the distribution of an ergodic exchangeable $k$-uniform hypergraph: every such measure arises as the pushforward of the countably-iterated Morley product of a global Borel-definable Keisler measure over the countable universal homogeneous $k$-uniform hypergraph. We show this by starting with a Borel $k$-hypergraphon $W$ and constructing a Keisler measure $\mu_{W}$ such that generic sampling with respect to $\mu_{W}$ yields the same invariant measure as does the standard hypergraphon sampling procedure with respect to $W$. When $k = 2$, our results give a new representation theorem for ergodic exchangeable graphs via Keisler measures over a monster model of the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Residually Constructible Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10033v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be an o-minimal theory expanding $\mathrm{RCF}$ and $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ be the common theory of its models expanded by predicate for a non-trivial $T$-convex valuation ring. We call an elementary extension $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*) \models T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ $\textit{res-constructible}$ if there is a tuple $\overline{s}$ in $\mathcal{O}_*$ such that $\mathbb{E}_*=\mathrm{dcl}(\mathbb{E},\overline{s})$, and the projection $\mathbf{res}(\overline{s})$ of $\overline{s}$ in the residue field sort is $\mathrm{dcl}$-independent over the residue field $\mathbf{res}(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$ of $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$. We study factorization properties of res-constructible extensions. Our main result is that a res-constructible extension $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ has the property that all $(\mathbb{E}_1, \mathcal{O}_1)$ with $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O}) \prec (\mathbb{E}_1, \mathcal{O}_1) \prec (\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ are res-constructible over $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})$, if and only if $\mathbb{E}_*$ has countable dimension over $\mathbb{E}$ or the value group $\mathbf{val}(\mathbb{E}_*, \mathcal{O}_*)$ contains no uncountable well-ordered subset. This analysis entails complete answers to [9, Problem 5.12].</description>

Abstract: I initiate the study of models of the affine part of Peano arithmetic. These models are generally lattice ordered and carry a nontrivial metric. The affine variants of several classical results in Peano arithmetic are proved. In particular, undecidability of affine arithmetic and the affine form of Gaifman's splitting theorem are proved.</description>

      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect. I show that the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic, whether it fixes a unique future given the present, can depend on choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is intractable disagreement. This dependence is not confined to hypothetical examples. It reaches into mainstream, discrete, and frontier physics, including the dynamics of Kerr black hole interiors. One upshot is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories (in which case physics itself becomes relative), or the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any polynomial $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2) \in \mathbb{C}[X, Y_0, Y_1, Y_2]$, the equation $F(z,j(z),j'(z),j''(z))=0$ has a Zariski dense set of solutions in the hypersurface $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2)=0$, unless $F$ is in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ or it is divisible by $Y_0$, $Y_0-1728$, or $Y_1$.
  Our methods establish criteria for finding solutions to more general equations involving periodic functions. Furthermore, they produce a qualitative description of the distribution of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Simply-typed constant-domain modal lambda calculus I: distanced beta reduction and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed that combines modal logic and simply-typed lambda calculus, and that generalizes the system studied by Montague and Gallin. Whereas Montague and Gallin worked with Church's simple theory of types, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed in the typed base theory most commonly used today, namely the simply-typed lambda calculus. Further, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is controlled by a parameter $\theta$ which allows more options for state types and state variables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is to establish the basic metatheory of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$: (i) a completeness theorem is proven for $\beta\eta$-reduction, and (ii) an Andrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is given; and this involves, with some necessity, a distanced version of $\beta$-reduction and a $\mathsf{BCKW}$-like basis rather than $\mathsf{SKI}$-like basis. Further, conservation of the maximal system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ over $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven, and expressibility of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ in $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven; thus these modal logics are highly expressive. Similar results are proven for the relation between $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol\lambda$, the corresponding ordinary simply-typed lambda calculus. This answers a question of Zimmermann in the simply-typed setting. In a companion paper this is extended to Church's simple theory of types.</description>
