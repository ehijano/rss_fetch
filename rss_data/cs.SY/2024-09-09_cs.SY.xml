      <title>Hierarchical Optimal Dispatch of Active Distribution Networks Considering Flexibility Auxiliary Service of Multi-community Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active distribution networks (ADNs) are the main platforms for carrying large-scale distributed renewable energy and flexible resources, and multi-community integrated energy systems (MCIESs) may become important flexible resource supplies in ADNs owing to their multi-energy synergistic and complementary advantages. To fully utilize the flexible regulation potential of MCIESs for ADNs, a novel hierarchical stochastic dispatch approach for ADNs that considers flexibility auxiliary services of MCIESs is proposed. In this approach, a flexibility auxiliary service pricing strategy that combines adjustment cost and flexibility margin is established by evaluating the operational flexibility of MCIESs. In addition, considering renewable uncertainty, an MCIES-ADN flexibility interaction mechanism based on insufficient flexibility risk is designed to optimize their operation strategies and reduce the uncertainty risk. In the solution phase, an analytical target cascading theory-based distributed solving method is developed to realize decoupling and parallel solving of multiple stakeholders. The simulation results for a PG&amp;E 69-node system with three CIESs demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves MCIES revenue but also enhances ADN flexibility to consume renewable energy, which provides a fundamental way for efficient application of regional mutual aid.</description>

      <title>New parametric identification method for a preference model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a contribution to multi-criteria decision support intended for industrial decision-makers in order to determine the best compromise between design criteria when working on risky or innovative products. In (RENAUD et al. 2008) we used the OWA operator (Ordered Weighted Average), a well-known multi-criteria analysis technique introduced by (YAGER 1988). The interest of this aggregation method is, beyond its ease of use, its ability to evaluate a product according to a single scale. When using the OWA method, the choice of criterion weights and their values remains an important and delicate operation. Indeed, the weights are not fixed by criterion but according to a level of utility (FISHBURN 1967). The weights can, in addition, be determined using different methods. A traditional approach consists in estimating the weights from an a priori selection of the most representative samples by an expert. We propose a new approach based on applied D-Optimality to determine the best sample. The results of the two approaches are compared. Indeed, in some multi-criteria decision problems, it is difficult to choose the method that best describes the behavior of the decision maker. As said above, the first part of this paper presents an original method based on D-optimality to determine the most representative set of samples to determine the decision parameters. This method has been applied and validated in an OWA approach. It has been shown that the accuracy and reliability of the method have been improved. Since the OWA application has been improved, the other goal of this paper is to verify whether the real decision maker has an OWA-based behavior or not. To achieve this, the D-optimality approach is applied to the MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) approach to find the best set of samples. The results of the two methods are compared. Both approaches show that, while OWA better simulates the decision maker's behavior, there is still a gap between its scores and that of OWA. The question here is how to improve the accuracy of the score estimated by OWA compared to those given by the expert. Subsequently, a hybrid approach is tested, such as a linear combination of the MAUT and OWA approaches. The results obtained with this combination were found to be more accurate than those of OWA. However, we also tested the CHOQUET discrete integral approach. In other words, it is possible to find a model capable of better describing the decision maker's behavior.</description>

      <title>Discovering Governing equations from Graph-Structured Data by Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. SINDyG discovers the governing equations of network dynamics while offering improvements in accuracy and model simplicity.</description>

      <title>State and Action Factorization in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase of renewable energy generation towards the zero-emission target is making the problem of controlling power grids more and more challenging. The recent series of competitions Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) have encouraged the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the assistance of human dispatchers in operating power grids. All the solutions proposed so far severely restrict the action space and are based on a single agent acting on the entire grid or multiple independent agents acting at the substations level. In this work, we propose a domain-agnostic algorithm that estimates correlations between state and action components entirely based on data. Highly correlated state-action pairs are grouped together to create simpler, possibly independent subproblems that can lead to distinct learning processes with less computational and data requirements. The algorithm is validated on a power grid benchmark obtained with the Grid2Op simulator that has been used throughout the aforementioned competitions, showing that our algorithm is in line with domain-expert analysis. Based on these results, we lay a theoretically-grounded foundation for using distributed reinforcement learning in order to improve the existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal decentralized wavelength control in light sources for lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed light sources are a critical component of modern lithography, with fine light beam wavelength control paramount for wafer etching accuracy. We study optimal wavelength control by casting it as a decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem in presence of time-delays. In particular, we consider the multi-optics module (optics and actuators) used for generating the requisite wavelength in light sources as cooperatively interacting systems defined over a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We show that any measurement and other continuous time-delays can be exactly compensated, and the resulting optimal controller implementation at the individual optics-level outperforms any existing wavelength control techniques.</description>

Abstract: The design and production of VLSI chips is a multilevel heirarchical process. As the demand for reduced die-area and technology nodes becomes prevalent, it gets increasingly challenging to optimize Power, Performance and Area (PPA) parameters to accommodate for the ever-increasing core logic on a chip. A well defined heirarchical flow is thus quintessential when it comes to VLSI design process. A robust heirarchical flow should encompass all stages, right from Gate-level RTL Synthesis (Front End Design) to Logic Placement and Verification (Back End Physical Design) and finally culminating with tapeout / production. Physical Design in this aforementioned flow is the process of translating logical circuit description into physically realizable GDSII form. This involves defining the best possible placement and routing for standard cells, macros and I/Os in the design to optimize PPA for any given netlist. This paper helps capture the nitty-gritty of methodologies and algorithms that are pertinent to the building and optimization of an efficient and robust physical design flow in VLSI chip-designing process.</description>

      <title>Urban traffic analysis and forecasting through shared Koopman eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting traffic flow in data-scarce cities is challenging due to limited historical data. To address this, we leverage transfer learning by identifying periodic patterns common to data-rich cities using a customized variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): constrained Hankelized DMD (TrHDMD). This method uncovers common eigenmodes (urban heartbeats) in traffic patterns and transfers them to data-scarce cities, significantly enhancing prediction performance. TrHDMD reduces the need for extensive training datasets by utilizing prior knowledge from other cities. By applying Koopman operator theory to multi-city loop detector data, we identify stable, interpretable, and time-invariant traffic modes. Injecting ``urban heartbeats'' into forecasting tasks improves prediction accuracy and has the potential to enhance traffic management strategies for cities with varying data infrastructures. Our work introduces cross-city knowledge transfer via shared Koopman eigenmodes, offering actionable insights and reliable forecasts for data-scarce urban environments.</description>

      <title>Barrier Integral Control for Global Asymptotic Stabilization of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems under Smooth Feedback and Transient Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of asymptotic stabilization for high-order control-affine MIMO nonlinear systems with unknown dynamic terms. We introduce Barrier Integral Control, a novel algorithm designed to confine the system's state within a predefined funnel, ensuring adherence to prescribed transient constraints, and asymptotically drive it to zero from any initial condition. The algorithm leverages the innovative integration of a reciprocal barrier function and an error-integral term, featuring smooth feedback control. Notably, it operates without relying on any information or approximation schemes for the (unknown) dynamic terms, which, unlike a large class of previous works, are not assumed to be bounded or to comply with globally Lipschitz/growth conditions. Additionally, the system's trajectory and asymptotic performance are decoupled from the uncertain model, control-gain selection, and initial conditions. Finally, comparative simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Rate Maximization in IRS-aided OWC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) is envisioned as one of the main enabling technologies of 6G networks, complementing radio frequency (RF) systems to provide high data rates. One of the crucial issues in indoor OWC is service interruptions due to blockages that obstruct the line of sight (LoS) between users and their access points (APs). Recently, reflecting surfaces referred to as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been considered to provide improved connectivity in OWC systems by reflecting AP signals toward users. In this study, we investigate the integration of IRSs into an indoor OWC system to improve the sum rate of the users and to ensure service continuity. We formulate an optimization problem for sum rate maximization, where the allocation of both APs and mirror elements of IRSs to users is determined to enhance the aggregate data rate. Moreover, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, specifically Q-learning and SARSA algorithms, are proposed to provide real-time solutions with low complexity and without prior system knowledge. The results show that the RL algorithms achieve near-optimal solutions that are close to the solutions of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The results also show that the proposed scheme achieves up to a 45% increase in data rate compared to a traditional scheme that optimizes only the allocation of APs while the mirror elements are assigned to users based on the distance.</description>

      <title>Protecting residential electrical panels and service through model predictive control: A field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential electrification - replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric machines - can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, installing electric appliances or vehicle charging in a residential building can sharply increase its current draws. In older housing, high current draws can jeopardize electrical infrastructure, such as circuit breaker panels or electrical service (the wires that connect a building to the distribution grid). Upgrading electrical infrastructure can entail long delays and high costs, so poses a significant barrier to electrification. This paper develops and field-tests a control system that avoids the need for electrical upgrades by keeping an electrified home's total current draw within the safe limits of its panel and service. In the proposed control architecture, a high-level controller plans device set-points over a rolling prediction horizon. A low-level controller monitors real-time conditions and ramps down devices if necessary. The control system was tested in an occupied, electrified single-family house with code-minimum insulation, an air-to-air heat pump and backup resistance heat, a resistance water heater, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with Level I charging. The field tests spanned 31 winter days with outdoor temperatures as low as -20 C. The control system maintained the whole-home current within the safe limits of electrical panels and service rated at 100 A, a common rating for older houses in North America, by adjusting only the temperature set-points of the heat pump and water heater. Simulations suggest that the same 100 A limit could accommodate a second electric vehicle with Level II charging. The proposed control system could allow older homes to safely electrify without upgrading electrical panels or service, saving a typical household on the order of $2,000 to $10,000.</description>

      <title>A Hetero-functional Graph Resilience Analysis for Convergent Systems-of-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our modern life has grown to depend on many and nearly ubiquitous large complex engineering systems. Many disciplines now seemingly ask the same question: ``In the face of assumed disruption, to what degree will these systems continue to perform and when will they be able to bounce back to normal operation"? Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the greatest societal challenges of the Anthropocene era are intertwined, necessitating a convergent systems-of-systems modeling and analysis framework based upon reconciled ontologies, data, and theoretical methods. Consequently, this paper develops a methodology for hetero-functional graph resilience analysis and demonstrates it on a convergent system-of-systems. It uses the Systems Modeling Language, model-based systems engineering and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT) to overcome the convergence research challenges when constructing models and measures from multiple disciplines for systems resilience. The paper includes both the ``survival" as well as ``recovery" components of resilience. It also strikes a middle ground between two disparate approaches to resilience measurement: structural measurement of formal graphs and detailed behavioral simulation. This paper also generalizes a previous resilience measure based on HFGT and benefits from recent theoretical and computational developments in HFGT. To demonstrate the methodological developments, the resilience analysis is conducted on a hypothetical energy-water nexus system of moderate size as a type of system-of-systems.</description>

      <title>A Performance Bound for the Greedy Algorithm in a Generalized Class of String Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple performance bound for the greedy scheme in string optimization problems that obtains strong results. Our approach vastly generalizes the group of previously established greedy curvature bounds by Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984). We consider three constants, $\alpha_G$, $\alpha_G'$, and $\alpha_G''$ introduced by Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984), that are used in performance bounds of greedy schemes in submodular set optimization. We first generalize both of the $\alpha_G$ and $\alpha_G''$ bounds to string optimization problems in a manner that includes maximizing submodular set functions over matroids as a special case. We then derive a much simpler and computable bound that allows for applications to a far more general class of functions with string domains. We prove that our bound is superior to both the $\alpha_G$ and $\alpha_G''$ bounds and provide a counterexample to show that the $\alpha_G'$ bound is incorrect under the assumptions in Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984). We conclude with two applications. The first is an application of our result to sensor coverage problems. We demonstrate our performance bound in cases where the objective function is set submodular and string submodular. The second is an application to a social welfare maximization problem with black-box utility functions.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Logit Learning with the r-Lambert Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known replicator equation in evolutionary game theory describes how population-level behaviors change over time when individuals make decisions using simple imitation learning rules. In this paper, we study evolutionary dynamics based on a fundamentally different class of learning rules known as logit learning. Numerous previous studies on logit dynamics provide numerical evidence of bifurcations of multiple fixed points for several types of games. Our results here provide a more explicit analysis of the logit fixed points and their stability properties for the entire class of two-strategy population games -- by way of the $r$-Lambert function. We find that for Prisoner's Dilemma and anti-coordination games, there is only a single fixed point for all rationality levels. However, coordination games exhibit a pitchfork bifurcation: there is a single fixed point in a low-rationality regime, and three fixed points in a high-rationality regime. We provide an implicit characterization for the level of rationality where this bifurcation occurs. In all cases, the set of logit fixed points converges to the full set of Nash equilibria in the high rationality limit.</description>

      <title>On final opinions of the Friedkin-Johnsen model over random graphs with partially stubborn community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of final opinions for the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with a community of partially stubborn agents. The underlying network of the FJ model is symmetric and generated from a random graph model, in which each link is added independently from a Bernoulli distribution. It is shown that the final opinions of the FJ model will concentrate around those of an FJ model over the expected graph as the network size grows, on the condition that the stubborn agents are well connected to other agents. Probability bounds are proposed for the distance between these two final opinion vectors, respectively for the cases where there exist non-stubborn agents or not. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings. The simulation shows that, in presence of non-stubborn agents, the link probability between the stubborn and the non-stubborn communities affect the distance between the two final opinion vectors significantly. Additionally, if all agents are stubborn, the opinion distance decreases with the agent stubbornness.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems Under Acyclic Spatio-Temporal Task Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel distributed sampled-data control method tailored for heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a global spatio-temporal task with acyclic dependencies. Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cooperative Output Regulation with Input Delay Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cooperative output regulation (COR) of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with long input delay based on periodic event-triggered mechanism. Compared with other mechanisms, periodic event-triggered control can automatically guarantee a Zeno-free behavior and avoid the continuous monitoring of triggered conditions. First, a new periodic event-triggered distributed observer, which is based on the fully asynchronous communication data, is proposed to estimate the leader information. Second, a new distributed predictor feedback control method is proposed for the considered nonlinear MASs with input delay. By coordinate transformation, the MASs are mapped into new coupled ODE-PDE target systems with some disturbance-like terms. Then, we show that the COR problem is solvable. At last, to further save the communication resource, a periodic event-triggered mechanism is considered in the sensor-to-controller transmission in every agent. A new periodic event-triggered filter is proposed to deal with the periodic event-triggered feedback data. The MASs with input delay are mapped into coupled ODE-PDE target systems with sampled data information. Then, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions are constructed to demonstrate the exponential stability of the MASs. Simulations verify the validity of the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Large-scale road network partitioning: a deep learning method based on convolutional autoencoder model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of urbanization, the scale of urban road network continues to expand, especially in some Asian countries. Short-term traffic state prediction is one of the bases of traffic management and control. Constrained by the space-time cost of computation, the short-term traffic state prediction of large-scale urban road network is difficult. One way to solve this problem is to partition the whole network into multiple sub-networks to predict traffic state separately. In this study, a deep learning method is proposed for road network partitioning. The method mainly includes three steps. First, the daily speed series for roads are encoded into the matrix. Second, a convolutional autoencoder (AE) is built to extract series features and compress data. Third, the spatial hierarchical clustering method with adjacency relationship is applied in the road network. The proposed method was verified by the road network of Shenzhen which contains more than 5000 links. The results show that AE-hierarchical clustering distinguishes the tidal traffic characteristics and reflects the process of congestion propagation. Furthermore, two indicators are designed to make a quantitative comparison with spectral clustering: intra homogeneity increases by about 9% on average while inter heterogeneity about 9.5%. Compared with past methods, the time cost also decreases. The results may suggest ways to improve the management and control of urban road network in other metropolitan cities. The proposed method is expected to be extended to other problems related to large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Energy Internet: A Standardization-Based Blueprint Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonization of power and energy systems faces a bottleneck: The enormous number of user-side resources cannot be properly managed and operated by centralized system operators, who used to send dispatch instructions only to a few large power plants. To break through, we need not only new devices and algorithms, but structural reforms of our energy systems. Taking the Internet as a paradigm, a practicable design of the Energy Internet is presented based on the principle of standardization. A combination of stylized data and energy delivery, referred to as a Block of Energy Exchange (BEE), is designed as the media to be communicated, which is parsed by the Energy Internet Card. Each Energy Internet Card is assigned a unique MAC address, defining a participant of the Energy Internet, whose standardized profile will be automatically updated according to BEE transfers without the intervention of any centralized operator. The structure of Energy Internet and protocols thereof to support the transfer of BEE are presented. System operators will become Energy Internet Service Providers, who operate the energy system by flow control and dispatching centralized resources, which is decoupled from users' behaviors in the Energy Internet. Example shows that the Energy Internet can not only reduce carbon emissions via interactions between peers, but also promotes energy democracy and dwindles the gap in energy equity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Robust Continuous-Time Optimization Algorithms for Time-Varying Constrained Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed continuous-time optimization framework aimed at overcoming the challenges posed by time-varying cost functions and constraints in multi-agent systems, particularly those subject to disturbances. By incorporating tools such as log-barrier penalty functions to address inequality constraints, an integral sliding mode control for disturbance mitigation is proposed. The algorithm ensures asymptotic tracking of the optimal solution, achieving a tracking error of zero. The convergence of the introduced algorithms is demonstrated through Lyapunov analysis and nonsmooth techniques. Furthermore, the framework's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations considering two scenarios for the communication networks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Finite Bit Adaptive Quantization for Efficient Communication and Precision Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In realistic distributed optimization scenarios, individual nodes possess only partial information and communicate over bandwidth constrained channels. For this reason, the development of efficient distributed algorithms is essential. In our paper we addresses the challenge of unconstrained distributed optimization. In our scenario each node's local function exhibits strong convexity with Lipschitz continuous gradients. The exchange of information between nodes occurs through $3$-bit bandwidth-limited channels (i.e., nodes exchange messages represented by a only $3$-bits). Our proposed algorithm respects the network's bandwidth constraints by leveraging zoom-in and zoom-out operations to adjust quantizer parameters dynamically. We show that during our algorithm's operation nodes are able to converge to the exact optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate to the optimal solution. We conclude the paper with simulations that highlight our algorithm's unique characteristics.</description>

      <title>Power Control of Converters Connected via an L Filter to a Weak Grid. A Flatness-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a nonlinear strategy based on a flatness approach is used for controlling the instantaneous complex power supplied from the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) to a weak grid. To this end, the strategy introduced by the authors in [1] considering a strong grid is robustified for avoiding system instability when the converter is connected to an unknown grid. The robustification method consists of including a notch filter that estimates the PCC voltage and using it to build the controller (i.e. the measured PCC voltage used to design the control strategy for a strong grid is replaced by the PCC voltage estimated with the notch filter). In addition, before designing the controller, the steady-state stability and safe operation limits when injecting complex instantaneous power to a grid of unknown impedance are analyzed. This analysis is independent of the control strategy, and applies to all power injection schemes.
  Simulations are presented for showing the performance of the proposed controller in presence of a weak grid.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic Planning for the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a well-studied routing problem that has been extended to incorporate uncertainties, reflecting stochastic or dynamic travel costs, prize-collection costs, and prizes. Existing approaches may, however, be inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive Approach for Probabilistic paThs - ADAPT, that iteratively performs 'execution' and 'online planning' based on an initial 'offline' solution. The execution phase updates system status and records online cost observations. The online planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios, outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively. This work advances the field of OP with uncertainties, offering a reliable and efficient approach for real-world applications in uncertain and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Sigmoid and tanh Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Map (FGGCM) and Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Map (FGCM) are extensions of Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in terms of uncertainty. FGGCM allows for the processing of general grey number with multiple intervals, enabling FCM to better address uncertain situations. Although the convergence of FCM and FGCM has been discussed in many literature, the convergence of FGGCM has not been thoroughly explored. This paper aims to fill this research gap. First, metrics for the general grey number space and its vector space is given and proved using the Minkowski inequality. By utilizing the characteristic that Cauchy sequences are convergent sequences, the completeness of these two space is demonstrated. On this premise, utilizing Banach fixed point theorem and Browder-Gohde-Kirk fixed point theorem, combined with Lagrange's mean value theorem and Cauchy's inequality, deduces the sufficient conditions for FGGCM to converge to a unique fixed point when using tanh and sigmoid functions as activation functions. The sufficient conditions for the kernels and greyness of FGGCM to converge to a unique fixed point are also provided separately. Finally, based on Web Experience and Civil engineering FCM, designed corresponding FGGCM with sigmoid and tanh as activation functions by modifying the weights to general grey numbers. By comparing with the convergence theorems of FCM and FGCM, the effectiveness of the theorems proposed in this paper was verified. It was also demonstrated that the convergence theorems of FCM are special cases of the theorems proposed in this paper. The study for convergence of FGGCM is of great significance for guiding the learning algorithm of FGGCM, which is needed for designing FGGCM with specific fixed points, lays a solid theoretical foundation for the application of FGGCM in fields such as control, prediction, and decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control of input-affine systems: the role of the signature transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging tasks in control theory is arguably the design of a regulator for nonlinear systems when the dynamics are unknown. To tackle it, a popular strategy relies on finding a direct map between system responses and the controller, and the key ingredient is a predictor for system outputs trained on past trajectories. Focusing on continuous-time, input-affine systems, we show that the so-called signature transform provides rigorous and practically effective features to represent and predict system trajectories. Building upon such a tool, we propose a novel signature-based control strategy that is promising in view of data-driven predictive control.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of direct data-driven predictive control for unknown stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with partial state observation. Building upon our previous research on data-driven stochastic control, this paper (i) relaxes the assumption of Gaussian process and measurement noise, and (ii) enables optimization of the gain matrix within the affine feedback policy. Output safety constraints are modelled using conditional value-at-risk, and enforced in a distributionally robust sense. Under idealized assumptions, we prove that our proposed data-driven control method yields control inputs identical to those produced by an equivalent model-based stochastic predictive controller. A simulation study illustrates the enhanced performance of our approach over previous designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning is powerful. In recent years, it has enabled massive breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing. But leveraging these advances for optimal control has proved difficult. Data is a key limiting factor. Without access to the optimal policy, value function, or demonstrations, how can we fit a policy? In this paper, we show how to automatically generate supervised learning data for a class of continuous-time nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, applying the Feynman-Kac theorem to a linear reparameterization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE allows us to sample the value function by simulating a stochastic process. Hardware accelerators like GPUs could rapidly generate a large amount of this training data. With this data in hand, stochastic optimal control becomes supervised learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Torque-driven microscale swimming robots, or microrotors, hold significant potential in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and micromanipulation. This paper addresses the challenge of controlling the transport of fluid volumes using the flow fields generated by interacting groups of microrotors. Our approach uses polynomial chaos expansions to model the time evolution of fluid particle distributions and formulate an optimal control problem, which we solve numerically. We implement this framework in simulation to achieve the controlled transport of an initial fluid particle distribution to a target destination while minimizing undesirable effects such as stretching and mixing. We consider the case where translational velocities of the rotors are directly controlled, as well as the case where only torques are controlled and the rotors move in response to the collective flow fields they generate. We analyze the solution of this optimal control problem by computing the Lagrangian coherent structures of the associated flow field, which reveal the formation of transport barriers that efficiently guide particles toward their target. This analysis provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of controlled transport.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Feature Fusion with Point Pyramid for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective point cloud processing is crucial to LiDARbased autonomous driving systems. The capability to understand features at multiple scales is required for object detection of intelligent vehicles, where road users may appear in different sizes. Recent methods focus on the design of the feature aggregation operators, which collect features at different scales from the encoder backbone and assign them to the points of interest. While efforts are made into the aggregation modules, the importance of how to fuse these multi-scale features has been overlooked. This leads to insufficient feature communication across scales. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Point Pyramid RCNN (POP-RCNN), a feature pyramid-based framework for 3D object detection on point clouds. POP-RCNN consists of a Point Pyramid Feature Enhancement (PPFE) module to establish connections across spatial scales and semantic depths for information exchange. The PPFE module effectively fuses multi-scale features for rich information without the increased complexity in feature aggregation. To remedy the impact of inconsistent point densities, a point density confidence module is deployed. This design integration enables the use of a lightweight feature aggregator, and the emphasis on both shallow and deep semantics, realising a detection framework for 3D object detection. With great adaptability, the proposed method can be applied to a variety of existing frameworks to increase feature richness, especially for long-distance detection. By adopting the PPFE in the voxel-based and point-voxel-based baselines, experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance even with limited computational headroom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Whittle index learning algorithm for restless multi-armed bandits. We consider index learning algorithm with Q-learning. We first present Q-learning algorithm with exploration policies -- epsilon-greedy, softmax, epsilon-softmax with constant stepsizes. We extend the study of Q-learning to index learning for single-armed restless bandit. The algorithm of index learning is two-timescale variant of stochastic approximation, on slower timescale we update index learning scheme and on faster timescale we update Q-learning assuming fixed index value. In Q-learning updates are in asynchronous manner. We study constant stepsizes two timescale stochastic approximation algorithm. We provide analysis of two-timescale stochastic approximation for index learning with constant stepsizes. Further, we present study on index learning with deep Q-network (DQN) learning and linear function approximation with state-aggregation method. We describe the performance of our algorithms using numerical examples. We have shown that index learning with Q learning, DQN and function approximations learns the Whittle index.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic and uncertain societal-scale systems. In these systems, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often acting without any information about other agents. The design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remain elusive, especially beyond Markov zero-sum games and Markov potential games, which do not adequately capture the nature of many real-world interactions that is neither fully competitive nor fully cooperative. This paper investigates the design of decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide provable guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in the long run. Our approach builds on constructing a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) to address the intractability of designing algorithms that converge to exact Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that MNPFs play a central role in ensuring the convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning algorithm to approximate Nash equilibria. By leveraging a two-timescale approach, where Q-function estimates are updated faster than policy updates, we show that the system converges to a level set of the MNPF over the set of approximate Nash equilibria. This convergence result is further strengthened if the set of Nash equilibria is assumed to be finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis and design of decentralized learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Online Distributed Seeking for Generalized Nash Equilibrium of Nonmonotone Online Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper mainly investigates a class of distributed generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking problems for online nonmonotone game with time-varying coupling inequality constraints. Based on a time-varying control gain, a novel continuous-time distributed GNE seeking algorithm is proposed, which realizes the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound, matching those of the criteria for online optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce unnecessary communication among players, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism involving internal variables is introduced into the distributed GNE seeking algorithm, while the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound are still achieved. Also, the Zeno behavior is strictly prohibited. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Learning-Based Framework for VNF Caching and Placement Optimization over Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.</description>

      <title>Limiting Computation Levels in Prioritized Trajectory Planning with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prioritized planning for vehicles, vehicles plan trajectories in parallel or in sequence. Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Optimal Size of Grid-forming Energy Storage in an Off-grid Renewable P2H System under Multi-timescale Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utility-scale off-grid renewable power-to-hydrogen systems (OReP2HSs) typically include photovoltaic plants, wind turbines, electrolyzers (ELs), and energy storage systems. As an island system, OReP2HS requires at least one component, generally the battery energy storage system (BESS), that operates for grid-forming control to provide frequency and voltage references and regulate them through transient power support and short-term energy balance regulation. While larger BESS capacity increases this ability, it also raises investment costs. This paper proposes a framework of layered multi-timescale energy management system (EMS) and evaluates the most cost-effective size of the grid-forming BESS in the OReP2HS. The proposed EMS covers the timescales ranging from those for power system transient behaviors to intra-day scheduling, coordinating renewable power, BESS, and ELs. Then, an iterative search procedure based on high-fidelity simulation is employed to determine the size of the BESS with minimal levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Simulations over a reference year, based on the data from a planned OReP2HS project in Inner Mongolia, China, show that with the proposed EMS, the base-case optimal LCOH is 33.212 CNY/kg (4.581 USD/kg). The capital expenditure of the BESS accounts for 17.83% of the total, and the optimal BESS size accounts for 13.6% of the rated hourly energy output of power sources. Sensitivity analysis reveals that by reducing the electrolytic load adjustment time step from 90 to 5 s and increasing its ramping limit from 1% to 10% rated power per second, the BESS size decreases by 53.57%, and the LCOH decreases to 25.458 CNY/kg (3.511 USD/kg). Considering the cost of designing and manufacturing utility-scale ELs with fast load regulation capability, a load adjustment time step of 5-10 s and a ramping limit of 4-6% rated power per second are recommended.</description>

      <title>Developing Trajectory Planning with Behavioral Cloning and Proximal Policy Optimization for Path-Tracking and Static Obstacle Nudging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) have gained increasing popularity in autonomous driving. However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow, nor planning with horizons, leading strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce our trajectory planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) bootstrapped by BC for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors. This method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in trajectory planning problems of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast Rates for Federated and Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting involving $N$ agents, where each agent interacts with an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The agents' MDPs differ in their reward functions, capturing heterogeneous objectives/tasks. The collective goal of the agents is to communicate intermittently via a central server to find a policy that maximizes the average of long-term cumulative rewards across environments. The limited existing work on this topic either only provide asymptotic rates, or generate biased policies, or fail to establish any benefits of collaboration. In response, we propose Fast-FedPG - a novel federated policy gradient algorithm with a carefully designed bias-correction mechanism. Under a gradient-domination condition, we prove that our algorithm guarantees (i) fast linear convergence with exact gradients, and (ii) sub-linear rates that enjoy a linear speedup w.r.t. the number of agents with noisy, truncated policy gradients. Notably, in each case, the convergence is to a globally optimal policy with no heterogeneity-induced bias. In the absence of gradient-domination, we establish convergence to a first-order stationary point at a rate that continues to benefit from collaboration.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Visual Servoing for On-Orbit Servicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive visual servoing framework for robotic on-orbit servicing (OOS), specifically designed for capturing tumbling satellites. The vision-guided robotic system is capable of selecting optimal control actions in the event of partial or complete vision system failure, particularly in the short term. The autonomous system accounts for physical and operational constraints, executing visual servoing tasks to minimize a cost function. A hierarchical control architecture is developed, integrating a variant of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for image registration, a constrained noise-adaptive Kalman filter, fault detection and recovery logic, and a constrained optimal path planner. The dynamic estimator provides real-time estimates of unknown states and uncertain parameters essential for motion prediction, while ensuring consistency through a set of inequality constraints. It also adjusts the Kalman filter parameters adaptively in response to unexpected vision errors. In the event of vision system faults, a recovery strategy is activated, guided by fault detection logic that monitors the visual feedback via the metric fit error of image registration. The estimated/predicted pose and parameters are subsequently fed into an optimal path planner, which directs the robot's end-effector to the target's grasping point. This process is subject to multiple constraints, including acceleration limits, smooth capture, and line-of-sight maintenance with the target. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed visual servoing system successfully captured a free-floating object, despite complete occlusion of the vision system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), also known as JUNO-TAO. Located close to one of the reactors of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, TAO will measure the antineutrino energy spectrum precisely as a reference spectrum for JUNO. The data acquisition (DAQ) system is designed to acquire data from the TAO readout electronics and process it with software trigger and data compression algorithms. The data storage bandwidth is limited by the onsite network to be less than 100 Mb/s.
  Methods: The system is designed based on a distributed architecture, with fully decoupled modules to facilitate customized design and implementation. It is divided into two main components: the data flow system and the online software. The online software serves as the foundation, providing the electronics configuration, the process management, the run control, and the information sharing. The data flow system facilitates continuous data acquisition from various electronic boards or trigger systems, assembles and processes raw data, and ultimately stores it on the disk.
  Results: The core functionality of the system has been designed and developed. The usability of the data flow system interface and the software trigger results have been verified during the pre-installation testing phase.
  Conclusion: The DAQ system has been deployed for the TAO experiment. It has also successfully been applied to the integration test of the detector and electronics prototypes.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient 6G O-RAN: An Energy-Efficient URLLC Resource Allocation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demands of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in ``NextG" cellular networks necessitate innovative approaches for efficient resource utilisation. The current literature on 6G O-RAN primarily addresses improved mobile broadband (eMBB) performance or URLLC latency optimisation individually, often neglecting the intricate balance required to optimise both simultaneously under practical constraints. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a DRL-based resource allocation framework integrated with meta-learning to manage eMBB and URLLC services adaptively. Our approach efficiently allocates heterogeneous network resources, aiming to maximise energy efficiency (EE) while minimising URLLC latency, even under varying environmental conditions. We highlight the critical importance of accurately estimating the traffic distribution flow in the multi-connectivity (MC) scenario, as its uncertainty can significantly degrade EE. The proposed framework demonstrates superior adaptability across different path loss models, outperforming traditional methods and paving the way for more resilient and efficient 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Grid Dynamic Programming: Almost Sure Convergence and Probability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic Programming (DP) suffers from the well-known ``curse of dimensionality'', further exacerbated by the need to compute expectations over process noise in stochastic models. This paper presents a Monte Carlo-based sampling approach for the state space and an interpolation procedure for the resulting value function, dependent on the process noise density, in a "self-approximating" fashion, eliminating the need for ordering or set-membership tests. We provide proof of almost sure convergence for the value iteration (and consequently, policy iteration) procedure. The proposed meshless sampling and interpolation algorithm alleviates the burden of gridding the state space, traditionally required in DP, and avoids constructing a piecewise constant value function over a grid. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed interpolation procedure is well-suited for handling probabilistic constraints by sampling both infeasible and feasible regions. The curse of dimensionality cannot be avoided, however, this approach offers a practical framework for addressing lower-order stochastic nonlinear systems with probabilistic constraints, while eliminating the need for linear interpolations and set membership tests. Numerical examples are presented to further explain and illustrate the convenience of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Ground Fault Detection for Inverter-Based Microgrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground fault detection in inverter-based microgrid (IBM) systems is challenging, particularly in a real-time setting, as the fault current deviates slightly from the nominal value. This difficulty is reinforced when there are partially decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The conventional solution of installing more relays to obtain additional measurements is costly and also increases the complexity of the system. In this paper, we propose a data-assisted diagnosis scheme based on an optimization-based fault detection filter with the output current as the only measurement. Modeling the microgrid dynamics and the diagnosis filter, we formulate the filter design as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that accounts for decoupling partial disturbances, robustness to non-decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties by training with data, and ensuring fault sensitivity simultaneously. To ease the computational effort, we also provide an approximate but analytical solution to this QP. Additionally, we use classical statistical results to provide a thresholding mechanism that enjoys probabilistic false-alarm guarantees. Finally, we implement the IBM system with Simulink and Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Cooperative Search Approach for Complex Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative search approach suitable for complex environments. In the application, a fixed-wing UAV drops rotor UAVs to deploy the cluster rapidly. Meanwhile, the fixed-wing UAV works as a communication relay node to improve the search performance of the cluster further. The distributed model predictive control and genetic algorithms are adopted to make online intelligent decisions on UAVs search directions. On this basis, a jump grid decision method is proposed to satisfy the maneuverability constraints of UAVs, a parameter dynamic selection method is developed to make search decisions more responsive to task requirements, and a search information transmission method with low bandwidth is designed. This approach can enable UAVs to discover targets quickly, cope with various constraints and unexpected situations, and make adaptive decisions, significantly improving the robustness of search tasks in complex, dynamic, and unknown environments. The proposed approach is tested with several search scenarios, and simulation results show that the cooperative search performance of heterogeneous UAVs is significantly improved compared to homogeneous UAVs.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Metaplasticity for Continual Learning with Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices operating in dynamic environments critically need the ability to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting. The strict resource constraints in these devices pose a major challenge to achieve this, as continual learning entails memory and computational overhead. Crossbar architectures using memristor devices offer energy efficiency through compute-in-memory and hold promise to address this issue. However, memristors often exhibit low precision and high variability in conductance modulation, rendering them unsuitable for continual learning solutions that require precise modulation of weight magnitude for consolidation. Current approaches fall short to address this challenge directly and rely on auxiliary high-precision memory, leading to frequent memory access, high memory overhead, and energy dissipation. In this research, we propose probabilistic metaplasticity, which consolidates weights by modulating their update probability rather than magnitude. The proposed mechanism eliminates high-precision modification to weight magnitudes and, consequently, the need for auxiliary high-precision memory. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism by integrating probabilistic metaplasticity into a spiking network trained on an error threshold with low-precision memristor weights. Evaluations of continual learning benchmarks show that probabilistic metaplasticity achieves performance equivalent to state-of-the-art continual learning models with high-precision weights while consuming ~ 67% lower memory for additional parameters and up to ~ 60x lower energy during parameter updates compared to an auxiliary memory-based solution. The proposed model shows potential for energy-efficient continual learning with low-precision emerging devices.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>On Bounds for Greedy Schemes in String Optimization based on Greedy Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the celebrated bound introduced by Conforti and Cornu\'ejols (1984) for greedy schemes in submodular optimization. The bound assumes a submodular function defined on a collection of sets forming a matroid and is based on greedy curvature. We show that the bound holds for a very general class of string problems that includes maximizing submodular functions over set matroids as a special case. We also derive a bound that is computable in the sense that they depend only on quantities along the greedy trajectory. We prove that our bound is superior to the greedy curvature bound of Conforti and Cornu\'ejols. In addition, our bound holds under a condition that is weaker than submodularity.</description>

      <title>Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear State-Space Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of a model resulting from (black-box) system identification is highly dependent on the quality of the data that is used during the identification procedure. Designing experiments for linear time-invariant systems is well understood and mainly focuses on the power spectrum of the input signal. Performing experiment design for nonlinear system identification on the other hand remains an open challenge as informativity of the data depends both on the frequency-domain content and on the time-domain evolution of the input signal. Furthermore, as nonlinear system identification is much more sensitive to modeling and extrapolation errors, having experiments that explore the considered operation range of interest is of high importance. Hence, this paper focuses on designing space-filling experiments i.e., experiments that cover the full operation range of interest, for nonlinear dynamical systems that can be represented in a state-space form using a broad set of input signals. The presented experiment design approach can straightforwardly be extended to a wider range of system classes (e.g., NARMAX). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated on the experiment design for a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system, using a multisine input signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Joint Load and Capacity Scheduling for Flexible Radio Resource Management of High-Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work first explores using flexible beam-user mapping to optimize the beam service range and beam position, in order to adapt the non-uniform traffic demand to offer in high-throughput satellite (HTS) systems. Second, on this basis, the joint flexible bandwidth allocation is adopted to adapt the offer to demand at the same time. This strategy allows both beam capacity and load to be adjusted to cope with the traffic demand. The new information generated during the load transfer process of flexible beam-user mapping can guide the direction of beam optimization. Then, the proposed strategies are tested against joint power-bandwidth allocation and joint optimization of bandwidth and beam-user mapping under different traffic profiles. Numerical results are obtained for various non-uniform traffic distributions to evaluate the performance of the solutions. Results show that flexible joint load and capacity scheduling are superior to other strategies in terms of demand satisfaction with acceptable complexity. Our source code along with results are available at crystal-zwz/HTS_RRM_Joint-Load-and-Capacity-Scheduling (github.com).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient rectenna (rectifying antenna) using a binary optimization algorithm. A novel pixelated receiving antenna has been developed to match the diode impedance of a rectifier, eliminating the need for a separate matching circuit in the rectenna's rectifier. The receiving antenna configuration is fine-tuned via a binary optimization algorithm. A rectenna is designed using optimization algorithm at 2.5 GHz with 38% RF-DC conversion efficiency when subjected to 0 dBm incident power, with an output voltage of 815mV. The proposed rectenna demonstrates versatility across various low-power WPT (wireless power transfer) applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems that show different characteristics, such as finite-gain and passivity, depending on the nature of the inputs, are said to possess mixed input-output properties. In this paper, we provide a constructive method for characterizing mixed input-output properties of nonlinear systems using a dissipativity framework. Our results take inspiration from the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, and show that a system is mixed if it is dissipative with respect to highly specialized supply rates. The mixed input-output characterization is used for assessing stability of feedback interconnections in which the feedback components violate conditions of classical results such as the small-gain and passivity theorem. We showcase applicability of our results through various examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting unknown targets from data. We propose Online Residual Learning (ORL), a method that combines online adaptation with offline-trained predictions. At a lower level, we employ multiple offline predictions generated before or at the beginning of the prediction horizon. We augment every offline prediction by learning their respective residual error concerning the true target state online, using the recursive least squares algorithm. At a higher level, we treat the augmented lower-level predictors as experts, adopting the Prediction with Expert Advice framework. We utilize an adaptive softmax weighting scheme to form an aggregate prediction and provide guarantees for ORL in terms of regret. We employ ORL to boost performance in the setting of online pedestrian trajectory prediction. Based on data from the Stanford Drone Dataset, we show that ORL can demonstrate best-of-both-worlds performance.</description>

      <title>Contraction Theory for Nonlinear Stability Analysis and Learning-based Control: A Tutorial Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded digital devices are progressively deployed in dependable or safety-critical systems. These devices undergo significant hardware ageing, particularly in harsh environments. This increases their likelihood of failure. It is crucial to understand ageing processes and to detect hardware degradation early for guaranteeing system dependability. In this survey, we review the core ageing mechanisms, identify and categorize general working principles of ageing detection and monitoring techniques for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components that are prevalent in embedded systems: Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), microcontrollers, System-on-Chips (SoCs), and their power supplies. From our review, we find that online techniques are more widely applied on FPGAs than on other components, and see a rising trend towards machine learning application for analysing hardware ageing. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify research opportunities and potential directions of interest in the field. With this work, we intend to facilitate future research by systematically presenting all main approaches in a concise way.</description>

      <title>Patching Approximately Safe Value Functions Leveraging Local Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe value functions, such as control barrier functions, characterize a safe set and synthesize a safety filter, overriding unsafe actions, for a dynamic system. While function approximators like neural networks can synthesize approximately safe value functions, they typically lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a local dynamic programming-based approach to "patch" approximately safe value functions to obtain a safe value function. This algorithm, HJ-Patch, produces a novel value function that provides formal safety guarantees, yet retains the global structure of the initial value function. HJ-Patch modifies an approximately safe value function at states that are both (i) near the safety boundary and (ii) may violate safety. We iteratively update both this set of "active" states and the value function until convergence. This approach bridges the gap between value function approximation methods and formal safety through Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, offering a framework for integrating various safety methods. We provide simulation results on analytic and learned examples, demonstrating HJ-Patch reduces the computational complexity by 2 orders of magnitude with respect to standard HJ reachability. Additionally, we demonstrate the perils of using approximately safe value functions directly and showcase improved safety using HJ-Patch.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Logical Zonotope: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis of Logical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) between sets of points exactly in a reduced space, i.e., generator space with reduced complexity. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to $2^n$ binary vectors using only $n$ generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations in the generator space. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by dependent generators and exponent matrices. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol and (2) reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear feedback shift register.</description>

      <title>Actively Learning Reinforcement Learning: A Stochastic Optimal Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10831v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework towards achieving two intertwined objectives: (i) equipping reinforcement learning with active exploration and deliberate information gathering, such that it regulates state and parameter uncertainties resulting from modeling mismatches and noisy sensory; and (ii) overcoming the computational intractability of stochastic optimal control. We approach both objectives by using reinforcement learning to compute the stochastic optimal control law. On one hand, we avoid the curse of dimensionality prohibiting the direct solution of the stochastic dynamic programming equation. On the other hand, the resulting stochastic optimal control reinforcement learning agent admits caution and probing, that is, optimal online exploration and exploitation. Unlike fixed exploration and exploitation balance, caution and probing are employed automatically by the controller in real-time, even after the learning process is terminated. We conclude the paper with a numerical simulation, illustrating how a Linear Quadratic Regulator with the certainty equivalence assumption may lead to poor performance and filter divergence, while our proposed approach is stabilizing, of an acceptable performance, and computationally convenient.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guaranteed Safety-Critical Control with Applications to Heterogeneous Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00238v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies safety and feasibility guarantees for systems with tight control bounds. It has been shown that stabilizing an affine control system while optimizing a quadratic cost and satisfying state and control constraints can be mapped to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF). One of the main challenges in this method is that the QP could easily become infeasible under safety constraints of high relative degree, especially under tight control bounds. Recent work focused on deriving sufficient conditions for guaranteeing feasibility. The existing results are case-dependent. In this paper, we consider the general case. We define a feasibility constraint and propose a new type of CBF to enforce it. Our method guarantees the feasibility of the above mentioned QPs, while satisfying safety requirements. We demonstrate the proposed method on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem for a heterogeneous platoon with tight control bounds, and compare our method to existing CBF-CLF approaches. The results show that our proposed approach can generate gradually transitioned control (without abrupt changes) with guaranteed feasibility and safety.</description>

      <title>Learning Lyapunov-Stable Polynomial Dynamical Systems through Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a paradigm to address complex motion planning problems by learning a policy to imitate an expert's behavior. However, relying solely on the expert's data might lead to unsafe actions when the robot deviates from the demonstrated trajectories. Stability guarantees have previously been provided utilizing nonlinear dynamical systems, acting as high-level motion planners, in conjunction with the Lyapunov stability theorem. Yet, these methods are prone to inaccurate policies, high computational cost, sample inefficiency, or quasi stability when replicating complex and highly nonlinear trajectories. To mitigate this problem, we present an approach for learning a globally stable nonlinear dynamical system as a motion planning policy. We model the nonlinear dynamical system as a parametric polynomial and learn the polynomial's coefficients jointly with a Lyapunov candidate. To showcase its success, we compare our method against the state of the art in simulation and conduct real-world experiments with the Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator arm. Our experiments demonstrate the sample efficiency and reproduction accuracy of our method for various expert trajectories, while remaining stable in the face of perturbations.</description>

      <title>DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Providing Safety Assurances for Systems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more complex and integral in our society, the need to accurately model and safely control these systems has increased significantly. In the past decade, there has been tremendous success in using deep learning techniques to model and control systems that are difficult to model using first principles. However, providing safety assurances for such systems remains difficult, partially due to the uncertainty in the learned model. In this work, we aim to provide safety assurances for systems whose dynamics are not readily derived from first principles and, hence, are more advantageous to be learned using deep learning techniques. Given the system of interest and safety constraints, we learn an ensemble model of the system dynamics from data. Leveraging ensemble uncertainty as a measure of uncertainty in the learned dynamics model, we compute a maximal robust control invariant set, starting from which the system is guaranteed to satisfy the safety constraints under the condition that realized model uncertainties are contained in the predefined set of admissible model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a simulated case study with an inverted pendulum and a hardware experiment with a TurtleBot. The experiments show that our method robustifies the control actions of the system against model uncertainty and generates safe behaviors without being overly restrictive. The codes and accompanying videos can be found on the project website.</description>

      <title>Resilient Fleet Management for Energy-Aware Intra-Factory Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.</description>

      <title>Multistep Inverse Is Not All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world control settings, the observation space is often unnecessarily high-dimensional and subject to time-correlated noise. However, the controllable dynamics of the system are often far simpler than the dynamics of the raw observations. It is therefore desirable to learn an encoder to map the observation space to a simpler space of control-relevant variables. In this work, we consider the Ex-BMDP model, first proposed by Efroni et al. (2022), which formalizes control problems where observations can be factorized into an action-dependent latent state which evolves deterministically, and action-independent time-correlated noise. Lamb et al. (2022) proposes the "AC-State" method for learning an encoder to extract a complete action-dependent latent state representation from the observations in such problems. AC-State is a multistep-inverse method, in that it uses the encoding of the the first and last state in a path to predict the first action in the path. However, we identify cases where AC-State will fail to learn a correct latent representation of the agent-controllable factor of the state. We therefore propose a new algorithm, ACDF, which combines multistep-inverse prediction with a latent forward model. ACDF is guaranteed to correctly infer an action-dependent latent state encoder for a large class of Ex-BMDP models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACDF on tabular Ex-BMDPs through numerical simulations; as well as high-dimensional environments using neural-network-based encoders.

      <title>Stability Properties of the Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator in 1-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator (IGO) is a mathematical model of a hybrid closed-loop system. It arises by closing a special kind of continuous linear positive time-invariant system with impulsive feedback, which employs both amplitude and frequency pulse modulation. The structure of IGO precludes the existence of equilibria, and all its solutions are oscillatory. With its origin in mathematical biology, the IGO also presents a control paradigm useful in a wide range of applications, in particular dosing of chemicals and medicines. Since the pulse modulation feedback mechanism introduces significant nonlinearity and non-smoothness in the closedloop dynamics, conventional controller design methods fail to apply. However, the hybrid dynamics of IGO reduce to a nonlinear, time-invariant discrete-time system, exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence between periodic solutions of the original IGO and those of the discrete-time system. The paper proposes a design approach that leverages the linearization of the equivalent discrete-time dynamics in the vicinity of a fixed point. A simple and efficient local stability condition of the 1-cycle in terms of the characteristics of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions is obtained.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Robotics: Tail Risk Measures in Planning, Control, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need for a systematic approach to risk assessment has increased in recent years due to the ubiquity of autonomous systems that alter our day-to-day experiences and their need for safety, e.g., for self-driving vehicles, mobile service robots, and bipedal robots. These systems are expected to function safely in unpredictable environments and interact seamlessly with humans, whose behavior is notably challenging to forecast. We present a survey of risk-aware methodologies for autonomous systems. We adopt a contemporary risk-aware approach to mitigate rare and detrimental outcomes by advocating the use of tail risk measures, a concept borrowed from financial literature. This survey will introduce these measures and explain their relevance in the context of robotic systems for planning, control, and verification applications.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles, same as the profiles of the waves closely connected with the shocks - the kinks. The profiles of the latter, and in some particular cases the profiles of the former, were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>
