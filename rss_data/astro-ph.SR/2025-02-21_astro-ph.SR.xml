      <title>Meridional Circulation. I. A Formation Channel for Lithium-rich and Super Lithium-rich Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observations indicate that stars with higher rotation rates appear to maintain more surface lithium, and the majority of lithium-rich giants are indeed red clump stars. Hence, we investigate the mechanisms behind lithium enrichment in rotating red clump stars and the pathways to forming lithium-rich red clump stars. Meridional circulation is prevalent in the radiative zone of rotating giants. We model its radial mixing as a diffusion process and derive the corresponding diffusion coefficient based on its material transfer effect. Due to uncertainties in numerical calculations, we consider an average diffusion effect. Additionally, certain limiting conditions for the radial velocity of meridional circulation are incorporated. With varying input rotation velocities, we simulate the lithium evolution for red clump stars with this model. Our results indicate that the material transfer effect due to meridional circulation can efficiently transport beryllium, produced by H burning, into the convective envelope. This meridional circulation can lead to lithium enrichment, with a maximum lithium abundance increment approaching \(3.0\,\rm dex\). Consequently, it is capable of forming both lithium-rich and super lithium-rich red clump stars. The degree of lithium enrichment exhibits a strong positive correlation with the rotation velocity, i.e., faster red clump stars show more surface lithium. Furthermore, our models indicate that lithium-rich red clump stars are relatively young (\(\sim 10^6\,\rm yr\)), which aligns with observation evidences.</description>

      <title>Localizing short-period pulsations in hard X-rays and Gamma-rays during an X9.0 flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feature of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) is frequently observed in the light curve of solar and stellar flares. In this letter, we investigated the QPP at a shorter period in high-energy channels of HXRs and Ggamma-ray continuum during an X9.0 flare on October 3, 2024 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08). The X9.0 flare was simultaneously measured by the Hard X-ray Imager, the Konus-Wind, and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. The shorter period center at about 1 s was determined by the fast Fourier transform with a Bayesianbased Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the wavelet analysis method. The restructured images show that the HXR sources are mainly separated into two fragments, regarding as double footpoints. Moreover, the footpoints move significantly during the flare QPP. Our results suggest that the intermittent and impulsive energy releases during the powerful flare are mainly caused by the interaction of hot plasma loops that are rooted in double footpoints. Thus, the flare QPP at a shorter period of about 1 s in HXR and Gamma-ray continuum emissions can be well explained by the interacting loop model.</description>

      <title>Understanding observational characteristics of solar flare current sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elongated bright structures above solar flare loops are suggested to be current sheets, where magnetic reconnection takes place. Observations have revealed various characteristics of the current sheet; however, their physical origin remains to be ascertained. In this study we aim to reveal the relations of observational characteristics of current sheets with the fundamental processes of magnetic reconnection. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection within a solar flare current sheet, we synthesized the remote-sensing observations of the current sheet and determined their physical properties. Turbulent magnetic reconnection can significantly broaden the apparent width of the current sheet, which is much larger than the realistic physical width because of the superposition effect. The differential emission measures of the current sheet have two peaks; the high-temperature component is spatially related to confirmed small-scale reconnection sites, showing that the current sheet is directly heated by reconnection. Moreover, we demonstrate that strong turbulence can cause the nonthermal broadening of spectral lines at both the current sheet and flare loop-top regions. A strong correlation between them in time is also observed. Our 3D turbulent magnetic reconnection flare model can be used to interpret primary observational characteristics of the elongated bright current sheets of solar flares.</description>

      <title>Uniturbulence and Alfven wave solar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AWSOM-type models (Van der Holst et al. 2014) have been very successful in describing the solar atmosphere by incorporating the Alfven wave driving as extra contributions in the global MHD equations. However, they lack the contributions from other wave modes. In this paper, we aim to write governing equations for the energy evolution equation of kink waves. In a similar manner as AWSOM, we combine the kink wave evolution equation with MHD. Our goal is to incorporate the extra heating provided by the uniturbulent damping of the kink waves. We attempt to construct the UAWSOM equations (uniturbulence and Alfven wave driven solar models). We have recently described the MHD equations in terms of the Q-variables. These latter variables allow to follow the evolution of waves in a co-propagating reference frame. We transform the Q-variable MHD equations into an energy evolution equation. First we do this generally, and then we specialise to the description of kink waves. We also couple this evolution equation to the slowly varying MHD formulation and solve the system in 1D. We find that the kink wave energy evolution equation contains non-linear terms, even in the absence of counterpropagating waves. The non-linear damping is expressed solely through equilibrium parameters, rather than an ad-hoc perpendicular correlation term, as in the case of the AWSOM models. A proof-of-concept numerical implementation in python shows that the kink wave driving indeed leads to radial outflow and heating. Thus, UAWSOM may have the necessary ingredients to drive the solar wind and heat the solar corona against losses. Not only does our current work constitute a pathway to fix shortcomings in heating and wind driving in the popular AWSOM model, it also provides the mathematical formalism to incorporate more wave modes for additional driving of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>COSMIC-S: a photometric Catalogue of Observed Stars in the Small MagellanIc Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) is a wide-field instrument mounted on the 4m V. Blanco Telescope (CTIO). Its impressive technical characteristics makes it one of the most suitable ground-based telescope for the production of accurate stellar photometry even towards crowded regions such as the Magellanic Clouds. We analysed DECam images acquired from February 2018 to January 2020 towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. We performed a PSF photometry by using the SExtractor and PSFEx tools and producing a comprehensive photometric catalogue in the SDSS system, considering the $gri$ filters. Then, we present COSMIC-S, a photometric catalogue consisting of 10 971 906 sources, including $gri$ magnitudes with a mean error $&lt;\sigma_m&gt; \simeq 0.04$ mag. A total of 2 456 434 sources have good photometry in all three bands. The catalogue appears virtually complete to $m \simeq 22$, with a limiting magnitude $m\simeq 25$. We derived the colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams in order to prove the goodness of the catalogue.</description>

      <title>MHD Modeling of the Near-Sun Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejection Initiated from a Sheared Arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are phenomena in which the Sun suddenly releases a mass of energy and magnetized plasma, potentially leading to adverse space weather. Numerical simulation provides an important avenue for comprehensively understanding the structure and mechanism of CMEs. Here we present a global-corona MHD simulation of a CME originating from sheared magnetic arcade and its interaction with the near-Sun solar wind. Our simulation encompasses the pre-CME phase with gradual accumulation of free magnetic energy (and building up of a current sheet within the sheared arcade) as driven by the photospheric shearing motion, the initiation of CME as magnetic reconnection commences at the current sheet, and its subsequent evolution and propagation to around 0.1 AU. A twisted magnetic flux rope (MFR), as the main body of the CME, is created by the continuous reconnection during the eruption. By interacting with the ambient field, the MFR experiences both rotation and deflection during the evolution. The CME exhibits a typical three-part structure, namely a bright core, a dark cavity and a bright front. The bright core is mainly located at the lower part of the MFR, where plasma is rapidly pumped in by the high-speed reconnection outflow. The dark cavity contains both outer layer of the MFR and its overlying field that expands rapidly as the whole magnetic structure moves out. The bright front is formed due to compression of plasma ahead of the fast-moving magnetic structure. Future data-driven modeling of CME will be built upon this simulation with real observations used for the bottom boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a centennial timescale, solar activity was quantified based on records of instrumental sunspot observations. This article briefly discusses several aspects of the recent archival investigations of historical sunspot records in the 17th to 18th centuries. This article also reviews the recent updates for the active day fraction and positions of the reported sunspot groups of the Maunder Minimum to show their significance within the observational history. These archival investigations serve as base datasets for reconstructing solar activity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on optical and near-infrared variability in the localisation of the long-period radio transient GLEAM-X J1627-52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GLEAM-X J1627-52 was discovered as a periodic (~18 min) radio signal over a duration of three months in 2018. It is an enigmatic example of a growing population of 'long-period radio transients' consistent with Galactic origins. Their nature is uncertain, and leading models invoke magnetic neutron stars or white dwarfs, potentially in close binary systems, to power them. GLEAM-X J1627-52 resides in the Galactic plane with a comparatively coarse localisation (~2 arcsecond). Here we study the localisation region to search for spectrophotometric signatures of a counterpart using time-domain searches in optical and near-infrared imaging, and MUSE integral field spectroscopy. No sources in the localisation display clear white dwarf spectral signatures, although at the expected distance we can only provide modest limits on their presence directly. We rule out the presence of hot sub-dwarfs in the vicinity. We found no candidate within our search for variability or periodic behaviour in the light curves. Radial velocity curves additionally show only weak evidence of variation, requiring any realistic underlying system to have very low orbital inclination (i &lt; 5 deg). Two Balmer emission line sources are reminiscent of white dwarf pulsar systems, but their characteristics fall within expected M-dwarf chromospheric activity with no signs of being in a close binary. Currently the white dwarf pulsar scenario is not supported, although longer baseline data and data contemporaneous with a radio active epoch are required before stronger statements. Isolated magnetars, or compact binaries remain viable. Our limits highlight the difficulty of these searches in dense environments at the limits of ground-based data.</description>

      <title>Catching the wisps: Stellar mass-loss limits from low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The winds of low-mass stars carry away angular momentum and impact the atmospheres of surrounding planets. Determining the properties of these winds is necessary to understand the mass-loss history of the star and the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres. Due to their tenuous nature, the winds of low-mass main-sequence stars are difficult to detect. The few existing techniques for measuring these winds are indirect, with the most common inference method for winds of low-mass stars being astrospheric Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption combined with complex hydrodynamical modelling of the interaction between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium. Here, we employ a more direct method to place upper limits on the mass-loss rates of low-mass stars by combining observations of low-frequency coherent radio emission, the lack of free-free absorption, and a simple stellar wind model. We determine upper limits on the mass-loss rate for a sample of 19 M dwarf stars detected with the LOFAR telescope at 120--168 MHz, reaching a sensitivity within an order of magnitude of the solar mass-loss rate for cold stars with a surface magnetic field strength of $\sim$100 G. The sensitivity of our method does not depend on distance or spectral type, allowing us to find mass-loss rate constraints for stars up to spectral type M6 and out to a distance of 50 pc, later and farther than previous measurements. With upcoming low-frequency surveys with both LOFAR and the Square Kilometre Array, the number of stars with mass-loss rate upper limits determined with this method could reach $\sim$1000.</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral analysis of GK Persei during the 2010 dwarf nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GK Persei, an old nova and intermediate polar (IP), exhibited a dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2010. This outburst was extensively observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, beginning 1.95 days after the eruption and continuing until 13.9 days before the maximum of the outburst in the optical. In this paper, we present timing and spectral analyses, comparing the results with those of other outbursts. We confirm the spin modulation in the 2 $-$ 10 keV X-ray range with a period of $P_{\rm WD} = 351.325(9)$ s. Additionally, we detected spin modulation in the 0.3 $-$ 2 keV band during the second half of the observations, a feature not seen in the 2015 and 2018 outbursts. This finding suggests that the soft X-ray emission in GK Per may originate partly near the magnetic poles and partly from a wind or circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>

      <title>High-frequency coronal Alfv\'enic waves observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence and nature of low-frequency (0.1-10~mHz) Alfv\'enic waves in the corona has been established over the last decade, with many of these results coming from coronagraphic observations of the infrared Fe XIII line. The Cryo-NIRSP instrument situated at DKIST has recently begun acquiring science quality data of the same Fe XIII line, with at least a factor of 9 improvement in spatial resolution, a factor 30 increase in temporal resolution and an increase in signal-to-noise, when compared to the majority of previously available data. Here we present an analysis of 1~s cadence sit-and-stare data from Cryo-NIRSP, examining the Doppler velocity fluctuations associated with the Fe XIII 1074~nm coronal line. We are able to confirm previous results of Alfv\'enic waves in the corona as well as explore a new frequency regime. The data reveals that the power law behaviour of the Doppler velocity power spectrum extends to higher frequencies. This result appears to challenge some models of photospheric-driven Alfv\'enic waves that predict a lack of high frequency wave power in the corona due to strong chromospheric damping. Moreover, the high-frequency waves do not transport as much energy as their low-frequency counterparts, with less time-averaged energy per frequency interval. We are also able to confirm the incompressible nature of the fluctuations with little coherence between the line amplitude and Doppler velocity time-series.</description>

Abstract: Using new telescope images and archival data, we investigated the positions and motions of the stars in double star system 06160-0745 BRT 376. We found that the two stars share nearly identical parallaxes and exhibit a low relative proper motion, suggesting they move together through space. Furthermore, their combined 3D velocity is less than the calculated escape velocity, indicating they are gravitationally bound rather than just physically near each other. These findings point to 06160-0745 BRT 376 being a true binary system. Future observations will help refine our understanding of its orbital path and further illuminate the nature of stars in close, interacting pairs.</description>

      <title>LEIA discovery of the longest-lasting and most energetic stellar X-ray flare ever detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) detected a new X-ray transient on 2022 November 7, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby K-type giant star HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double fast rise and exponential decay model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 * 10^12 cm. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted by a four-temperature apec model (with three components being the quiescent background), showing significant evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting that this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.</description>

      <title>Habitable Zone and Atmosphere Retention Distance (HaZARD) Stellar-evolution-dependent loss models of secondary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major open question in exoplanet research is whether secondary atmospheres are rare around Earth-sized rocky exoplanets. In this work we determine the distance at which an Earth-sized planet orbiting a variety of stellar hosts could retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere and compare this atmospheric retention distance (ARD) with that of the liquid-water HZ. We combined planetary atmosphere models with stellar evolution models. The atmospheric models produced by the thermochemical Kompot code allowed us to calculate the Jeans escape rates for different stellar masses, rotation rates, and ages. These loss rates allowed us to determine the closest distance a planet is likely to retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere. Using stellar rotation evolution models, we modelled how these retention distances evolve as the X-ray and ultraviolet activity of the star evolves. We find that the overlap of the HZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we find that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M_\odot are unlikely to retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully convective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can impact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially fast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for much longer. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in cycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD. Our results will have implications for future target selections of small exoplanet observing programmes with JWST or future instruments such as the Ariel space mission.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the inner heliosphere, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A Python Toolkit for Plotting Double Star Observations with 1:1 Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of double star astrometric data is essential for effective analysis and interpretation. This article presents a Python toolkit designed for astronomers who need to plot measurements from diverse sources -- historical, Gaia DR3, and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network -- while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio to avoid visually distorting the data. The toolkit is composed of three scripts: one that handles polar coordinates (P.A., separation), one for Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates, and another with the option to include predicted theoretical points. This paper describes the purpose, functionality, and usage of these scripts, including example figures, installation guides, and licensing information.
  This toolkit has been used by the author and collaborators in published and submitted research on double star systems, demonstrating its versatility for both professional and student-driven investigations.</description>
