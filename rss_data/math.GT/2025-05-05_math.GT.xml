      <title>Estimating distances in simplicial complexes with applications to 3-manifolds and handlebody-knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distance relations in various simplicial complexes associated with low-dimensional manifolds. In particular, complexes satisfying certain topological conditions with vertices as simple multi-curves. We obtain bounds on the distances in such complexes in terms of number of components in the vertices and distance in the curve complex. We then define new invariants for closed 3-manifolds and handlebody-knots. These are defined using the splitting distance which is calculated using the distance in a simplicial complex associated with the splitting surface arising from the Heegard decompositions of the 3-manifold. We prove that the splitting distances in each case is bounded from below under stabilizations and as a result the associated invariants converge to a non-trivial limit under stabilizations.</description>

      <title>Filling Links and Essential Systole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer a question of Freedman and Krushkal, producing filling links in any closed, orientable 3-manifold. The links we construct are hyperbolic, and have large essential systole, contrasting earlier geometric constraints on hyperbolic links in 3-manifolds due to Adams-Reid and Lakeland-Leininger.</description>

      <title>On the number of components of twisted torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted torus links $T(p,q;r,s)$ generalize torus links by introducing $s$ additional twists on $r$ adjacent strands of the torus link $T(p,q)$. It is well known that the number of components of a torus link $T(p, q)$ is given by the greatest common divisor of $p$ and $q$. However, determining the number of components of twisted torus links is not as straightforward based solely on their parameters. In this work, we present a Euclidean algorithm-like procedure for computing the number of components of twisted torus links based on their parameters. As a result, we show that the number of components of a twisted torus link $T(p, q; r, s)$ is a multiple of $\gcd(p, q, r, s)$, and in particular, $T(p, q; r, s)$ is a knot only if $\gcd(p, q, r, s) = 1$. We also use our algorithm to prove several conjectures related to the number of components in twisted torus links.</description>

Abstract: We show that a rational homology solid torus is a Heegaard Floer homology solid torus if and only if it has a Dehn filling with a non-separating 2-sphere. Using this, we characterize Seifert fibered Heegaard Floer solid tori.</description>

      <title>Helly-type theorems, CAT$(0)$ spaces, and actions of automorphism groups of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a variety of fixed-point theorems for groups acting on CAT$(0)$ spaces. Fixed points are obtained by a bootstrapping technique, whereby increasingly large subgroups are proved to have fixed points: specific configurations in the subgroup lattice of $\Gamma$ are exhibited and Helly-type theorems are developed to prove that the fixed-point sets of the subgroups in the configuration intersect. In this way, we obtain lower bounds on the smallest dimension ${\rm{FixDim}}(\Gamma)+1$ in which various groups of geometric interest can act on a complete CAT$(0)$ space without a global fixed point. For automorphism groups of free groups, we prove ${\rm{FixDim}}({\rm{Aut}}(F_n)) \ge \lfloor 2n/3\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>The Morse complex is an $\infty$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide two versions of the statement in the title. First, when the source is the category of smooth manifolds, we construct a simplicial map to a weak Kan complex whose objects are A-infinity coalgebras. Second, when the source is the category of compact Lie groups (or more generally, compact Lie monoids), the target is a weak Kan complex whose objects consist in $f$-bialgebras, as defined in [CHM24]. We also establish a statement describing module structures induced by group actions, as conjectured in [CHM24].</description>

      <title>Lie structures in homotopy and isotopy calculi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish compatibility of Lie structures that appear in homotopy calculus of functors and isotopy calculus of embeddings. On one hand, we give a new proof of the Johnson--Arone--Mahowald result describing the layers of the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor, and we directly compare the spectral Lie bracket with the classical Whitehead bracket on spaces. On the other hand, we geometrically define a bracket on the layers of the embedding calculus tower for embeddings of arcs. These results are unified through the same technical tool, a newly defined bracket on total homotopy fibres of collapsing cubes of wedge sums.</description>

      <title>Extending knot polynomials of braided Hopf algebras to links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a plethora of multivariable knot polynomials were introduced by Kashaev and one of the authors, by applying the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to rigid $R$-matrices that come for braided Hopf algebras with automorphisms. We study the extension of these knot invariants to links, and use this to identify some of them with known link invariants, as conjectured in that same recent work.</description>

      <title>Simple closed curves, non-kernel homology and Magnus embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the subspace of the homology of a covering space spanned by lifts of simple closed curves. Our main result is the existence of unbranched covers of surfaces where this is a proper subspace. More generally, for a fixed finite solvable quotient of the fundamental group we exhibit a cover whose homology is not generated by the lifts of curves in the complement of its kernel. We explain how the existing approach of Malestein and Putman (for branched covers) relates to the Magnus embedding, and by doing so we simplify their construction. We then generalise it to unbranched covers by producing embeddings of surface groups into units of certain graded associative algebras, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate degree one grasper families of embedded circles to various constructions of diffeomorphisms found in the literature -- theta clasper classes of Watanabe, barbell diffeomorphisms of Budney and Gabai, and twin twists of Gay and Hartman. We use a ``parameterised surgery map'' that for a smooth 4-manifold $M$ takes loops of framed embeddings of $S^1$ in the manifold obtained by surgery on some 2-sphere in $M$, to the mapping class group of $M$.</description>

      <title>Complexified tetrahedrons, fundamental groups, and volume conjecture for double twist knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the volume conjecture for double twist knots are proved. The main tool is the complexified tetrahedron and the associated $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ representation of the fundamental group. A complexified tetrahedron is a version of a truncated or a doubly truncated tetrahedron whose edge lengths and the dihedral angles are complexified. The colored Jones polynomial is expressed in terms of the quantum $6j$ symbol, which corresponds to the complexified tetrahedron.</description>

      <title>An unoriented skein exact triangle in unoriented link Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define band maps in unoriented link Floer homology and show that they form an unoriented skein exact triangle. These band maps are similar to the band maps in equivariant Khovanov homology given by the Lee deformation.
  As a key tool, we use a Heegaard Floer analogue of Bhat's recent 2-surgery exact triangle in instanton Floer homology, which may be of independent interest. Unoriented knot Floer homology corresponds to $I^{\sharp}$ of the knot in our 2-surgery exact triangle.</description>

      <title>Morse theory on moduli of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new approach to studying the moduli space of curves via Morse theory and hyperbolic geometry, by introducing a family of Morse functions on the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of stable curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked point, from the Teichm\"uller theoretic perspective. They are weighted exponential averages of the lengths of all simple closed geodesics. These Morse functions behave well with respect to the Deligne-Mumford stratification of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$. The critical points can be characterized by a combinatorial property named eutacticity, and the Morse index can be computed accordingly. Also, the Weil-Petersson gradient flow of the Morse functions is well defined on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, which can be used to build the Morse theory.
  These functions might be the first explicit examples of Morse functions on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, and the Morse handle decomposition gives rise to the first example of a natural cell decomposition of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in theory, that works for all pairs $(g,n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a non-positively curved cube complex with hyperbolic fundamental group. We prove that $\pi_1(X)$ has a non-free subgroup of infinite index unless $\pi_1(X)$ is either free or a surface group, answering questions of Gromov and Whyte (in a special case) and Wise. A similar result for one-relator groups follows, answering a question posed by several authors. The proof relies on a careful analysis of free and cyclic splittings of cubulated groups.</description>
