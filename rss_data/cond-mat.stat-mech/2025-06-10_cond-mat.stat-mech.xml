      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an information thermodynamics framework for feedback protocols that rely on temporal information. Using this framework, we show that random-time engines that appear to function as perpetuum mobile, such as stochastically stopped processes or heat engines with random-time protocols, actually satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. We illustrate the principles of temporal information thermodynamics on a random-time version of Szilard's engine, which is a paradigmatic example of a temporal information engine. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic cost of random times in external protocols, such as, in stochastic resetting protocols or in heat engines with random-time protocols.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>

      <title>Recoil of a driven tracer in a correlated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle after it is suddenly released from a harmonic trap moving with constant velocity through a fluctuating correlated medium, described by a scalar Gaussian field with relaxational dynamics and in contact with a thermal bath. We show that, after the release, the particle exhibits recoil, i.e., it moves in the direction opposite to the drag. As expected, this effect vanishes if the field equilibrates instantaneously. The final value of the average position of the particle is reached algebraically in time in the case of conserved dynamics of the field or for non-conserved dynamics at the critical point. Our predictions are expected to be relevant, at least qualitatively, to driven colloidal particles in liquid media close to critical points.</description>

      <title>Alignment and anisotropy of stresses in disordered granular media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the degeneracy of local stress states is a central challenge in obtaining the complete statistical mechanics of disordered media. Here, we introduce a minimal force-balance model for isolated granular clusters to probe the structure of the stress space through principal stress orientation and stress anisotropy. We further show that when complemented by physically motivated pairwise constraints, the model produces predictions for the stress alignment in packings of repulsive hard spheres. We compare these predictions against simulation data for grains in hopper and simple shear flows, finding quantitative agreement. This demonstrates the promise of modeling bulk athermal disordered systems through the combinatorics of few primitive geometric motifs.</description>

      <title>Nearest neighbor permutation entropy detects phase transitions in complex high-pressure systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the high-pressure phase behavior of carbon dioxide-hydrocarbon mixtures is of considerable interest owing to their wide range of applications. Under certain conditions, these systems are not amenable to direct visual monitoring, and experimentalists often rely on spectrophotometric data to infer phase behavior. Consequently, developing computationally efficient and robust methods to leverage such data is crucial. Here, we combine nearest neighbor permutation entropy, computed directly from in situ near-infrared absorbance spectra acquired during depressurization trials of mixtures of carbon dioxide and a distilled petroleum fraction, with an anomaly detection approach to identify phase transitions. We show that changes in nearest neighbor entropy effectively signal transitions from initially homogeneous mixtures to two-phase equilibria, thereby enabling accurate out-of-sample online predictions of transition pressures. Our approach requires minimum data preprocessing, no specialized detection techniques or visual inspection of the spectra, and is sufficiently general to be adapted for studying phase behavior in other high-pressure systems monitored via spectrophotometry.</description>

      <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</description>

      <title>Colloid-like scale-free cluster-cluster aggregation during polymer collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extended polymer collapses to form a globule when subjected to a quench below the collapse transition temperature. The process begins with the formation of clusters of monomers or ``pearls''. The nascent clusters merge, resulting in growth of the average cluster size $C_s$, eventually leading to a single globule. The aggregation of the clusters are known to be analogous to droplet coalescence. This suggests a striking resemblance between such an aggregation and cluster-cluster aggregation in colloidal self-assembly, which is characterized by a universal dynamic scaling behavior. Motivated by that, here, we verify the presence of such dynamic scaling during the collapse of a polymer with varying bending stiffness $\kappa$, using molecular dynamic simulations. We probe the dynamics via time evolution of the size distribution of clusters $N_s(t)$ and growth of $C_s(t)$. Irrespective of $\kappa$, we observe the power-law scalings $C_s(t)\sim t^z$ and $N_s(t)\sim t^{-w} s^{-\tau}$, of which only the cluster growth is universal with $z\approx 1.65$. Importantly, our results indeed show that $N_s(t)$ exhibits a dynamic scaling of the form $N_s(t)\sim s^{-2}f(s/t^z)$, indicative of a scale-free cluster growth. Interestingly, for flexible and weakly stiff polymers the dynamic exponents obey the relation $w=2z$, as also found in diffusion-controlled cluster-cluster aggregation of particles. For $\kappa \ge 5$, the exponents show deviation from this relation, which grows continuously with $\kappa$. We identify the differences in local structures of the clusters formed, leading to variations in cluster-size dependence of the effective diffusion constant to be the origin of the above deviation. We also discuss potential experimental strategies to directly visualize the observed dynamic scaling in a collapsing polymer.</description>

      <title>Simulating discrete-time quantum walk with urn model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urn models have long been used to study stochastic processes, probability distributions, and reinforcement dynamics. Meanwhile, discrete time quantum walks (DTQW) serve as fundamental components in quantum computation and quantum information theory. This work explores a novel connection between an urn model and discrete-time quantum walks, focusing on how urn-based stochastic processes can provide insights into quantum state evolution and algorithmic behavior. Importantly, our model operates entirely with real-valued quantities, without relying on complex amplitudes of the quantum walk. Every stochastic rule is derived from urn-based processes, whose parameters are governed by the coin and shift mechanisms of the quantum walk, maintaining the structural dynamics of the DTQW. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to bridge classical and quantum frameworks, offering new perspectives on both quantum algorithms and stochastic modeling. This work connects the urn model to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we will articulate a view of resilience under the free energy principle and vice versa. The free energy principle is about existence and identity, and resilience is the condition under which things exist at all. In previous work this has been investigated as modelling resilience using the free energy principle. We will extend that work by making the case that self-organisation under the free energy principle is about resilience, in the sense that identity is a constant process of self-reconfiguration, implying the existence of a self-model and the energy to reconfigure that self-model -- and hence, the resilience of a maintained identity under changes. A general framework for thinking about resilience in this context will be sketched out and some models will be provided using that framework.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified understanding of polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In polymer solutions, the phenomenon of cononsolvency describes when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for the polymer over some specific composition range. Observations of cononsolvency typically relate to either phase separation at the macroscopic level or chain collapse at the microscopic level. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between the macroscopic and microscopic observations of cononsolvency and how these differ by mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we distinguish between different mechanisms of cononsolvency using various models and observations derived from a single theoretical framework for polymer solutions. We first use mean-field analysis to identify energetic regimes, which are defined by sets of effective $\chi$ parameters, where changes in solvent/cosolvent composition induce phase separation. Next, to make a connection to the microscopic physics, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations of models with interactions that align with these effective $\chi$ parameters from these different regimes and observe corresponding composition-induced coil-globule transitions. These transitions are elucidated with signatures associated with specific mechanisms of cononsolvency from the literature. Interestingly, systems with identical effective $\chi$ parameters can display different mechanisms at the microscopic level. Ultimately, these results provide new insights into cononsolvency that may help to distinguish amongst mechanisms or inform strategies to control polymer solution behavior.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenvalues and experimental signatures of Heisenberg-Kitaev interactions in spin-1/2 quantum clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and energy eigenstates of a spin-1/2 coupled trimer, tetramer in a star configuration, and tetrahedron. Using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with additional Kitaev interactions, we explore the thermodynamic signatures of the Kitaev interaction. Our results show that introducing a Kitaev interaction generates a second Schottky anomaly in the heat capacity for systems with a large K/J ratio. The Kitaev term also introduces nonlinear eigenvalues with respect to a magnetic field, pushing the clusters toward a regime similar to the incomplete Paschen-Back effect and triggering first and second-order quantum phase transitions along with robust thermodynamic behavior. Through this approach, we provide exact analytical solutions that offer insights into Kitaev interactions, both in molecular magnets and in extended systems such as honeycomb or Kagome lattices. Furthermore, we provide insight into experimental measurements for detecting Kitaev interactions in clusters.</description>

      <title>Emergent gapless spiral phases and conformal Lifshitz criticality in the cluster Ising model with off-diagonal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analytical study of the exotic quantum phases and phase transitions emerging from the cluster-Ising model with off-diagonal Gamma interactions. Specifically, we map out the ground-state phase diagram by analyzing both local and nonlocal order parameters, together with the energy spectra. The results reveal two pairs of gapped phases, namely and antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phases, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, as well as two distinct gapless spiral phases induced by the off-diagonal interactions, which are related by a duality transformation and are numerically confirmed through the long-distance behavior of various order parameters. Remarkably, four distinct phase transition lines emerge in the phase diagram. Two of them, which separate the distinct gapped or gapless phases, are described by the Ising and three copy Ising conformal field theories, respectively. In contrast, the remaining two transition lines, between the gapless spiral and gapped phases, belong to a nonconformal Lifshitz criticality with dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$. More importantly, the intersection of these four transition lines gives rise to a new Lifshitz multicritical point exhibiting emergent conformal symmetry, marking a fundamental departure from all previously known nonconformal Lifshitz points. This work provides a valuable reference for future investigations of exotic gapless phases and their transitions in exactly solvable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. While we also observe our predicted instability in discrete-time simulations for small system sizes, discrete-time simulations of large systems show stability in the discrepant region even for long simulation times. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry of the interparticle interaction potential (IIP) plays a critical role in determining the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids. This study investigates the isolated effect of IIP asymmetry on thermalization. Asymmetry and nonlinearity are typically intertwined. To isolate the effect of asymmetry, we introduce a one-dimensional asymmetric harmonic (AH) model whose IIP possesses asymmetry but no nonlinearity, evidenced by energy-independent vibrational frequencies. Extensive numerical simulations confirm a power-law relationship between thermalization time ($T_{\rm eq}$) and perturbation strength for the AH chain, revealing an exponent larger than the previously observed inverse-square law in the thermodynamic limit. Upon adding symmetric quartic nonlinearity into the AH model, we systematically study thermalization under combined asymmetry and nonlinearity. Matthiessen's rule provides a good estimate of $T_{\rm eq}$ in this case. Our results demonstrate that asymmetry plays a distinct role in enhancing higher-order effects and governing relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonian approach to kinetic Ising models: Application to an infinitely long-range Husimi-Temperley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability distribution (PD) of spin configurations in kinetic Ising models has been cast in the form of the canonical Boltzmann PD with a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian (EH). It has been argued that in systems with extensive energy EH depends linearly on the number of spins $N$ leading to the exponential dependence of PD on the system size. In macroscopic systems the argument of the exponential function may reach values of the order of the Avogadro number which is impossible to deal with computationally, thus making unusable the linear master equation (ME) governing the PD evolution. To overcome the difficulty, it has been suggested to use instead the nonlinear ME (NLME) for the EH density per spin. It has been shown that in spatially homogeneous systems NLME contains only terms of order unity even in the thermodynamic limit. The approach has been illustrated with the kinetic Husimi-Temperley model (HTM) evolving under the Glauber dynamics. At finite $ N $ the known numerical results has been reproduced and extended to broader parameter ranges. In the thermodynamic limit an exact nonlinear partial differential equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi type for EH has been derived. It has been shown that the average magnetization in HTM evolves according to the conventional kinetic mean field equation.</description>

Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant dynamics in a purely deterministic Game of Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex dynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical size and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the question of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly affirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge in the \textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into a Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point -- associated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the non-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with unconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for critical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in previous work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in the $z$ direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and antikink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

Abstract: We present a dynamic scaling theory to describe relaxation dynamics following a magnetic-field quench near an unconventional phase transition in the magnetic material spin ice. Starting from a microscopic model, we derive an effective description for the critical dynamics in terms of the seeding and growth of string excitations, and use this to find scaling forms in terms of time, reduced temperature and monopole fugacity. We confirm the predictions of scaling theory using Monte Carlo simulations, which also show good quantitative agreement with analytical expressions valid in the limit of low monopole density. As well as being relevant for experiments in the spin ice materials, our results open the way for the study of dynamic critical properties in a family of unconventional classical phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged R\'enyi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete time crystal (DTC) is a remarkable non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the persistent sub-harmonic oscillations of physical observables in periodically driven many-body systems. Motivated by the question of whether such a temporal periodic order can persist when the drive becomes aperiodic, we investigate the dynamics of a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under quasiperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driving. Intriguingly, this infinite-range-interacting spin system can host ``quasi-discrete time crystal" (quasi-DTC) phases characterized by periodic oscillations of the magnetization. We demonstrate that our model can host the quasi-DTC analog of both period-doubling DTCs as well as higher-order DTCs. These quasi-DTCs are robust to various perturbations, and they originate from the interplay of ``all-to-all" interactions and the recursive structure of the TM sequence. Our results suggest that quasi-periodic driving protocols can provide a promising route for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter in long-range interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

Abstract: Cells produce RNA and proteins via molecular templating networks. We show that information transmission in such networks is bounded by functions of a simple thermodynamic property of the network, regardless of complexity. Surprisingly, putative systems operating at this bound do not have a high flux around the network. Instead, they have low entropy production, with each product in a ``pseudo-equilibrium'' determined by a single pathway. These pseudo-equilibrium limits constrain information transmission for the overall network, even if individual templates are arbitrarily specific.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in conformal field theory and holography</title>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish three new impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe -- a central object in quantum theory. We show that, if the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace H_0 of Hilbert space H (such as the one defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine or just significantly narrow down which vector it is. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other (and from the density matrix of H_0). Moreover, we show that for any observation that isn't too unlikely and most pairs of unit vectors from H_0, the observation will not significantly favor one vector over the other. We further show that the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H_0, after Bayesian updating in the light of any observation that isn't too unlikely, is still extremely close to uniform. Our arguments rely on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, for many applications, it is important to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>
