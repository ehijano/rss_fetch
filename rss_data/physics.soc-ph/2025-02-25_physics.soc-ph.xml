      <title>When to Boost: How Dose Timing Determines the Epidemic Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most vaccines require multiple doses, the first to induce recognition and antibody production and subsequent doses to boost the primary response and achieve optimal protection. We show that properly prioritizing the administration of first and second doses can shift the epidemic threshold, separating the disease-free from the endemic state and potentially preventing widespread outbreaks. Assuming homogeneous mixing, we prove that at a low vaccination rate, the best strategy is to give absolute priority to first doses. In contrast, for high vaccination rates, we propose a scheduling that outperforms a first-come first-served approach. We identify the threshold that separates these two scenarios and derive the optimal prioritization scheme and inter-dose interval. Agent-based simulations on real and synthetic contact networks validate our findings. We provide specific guidelines for effective resource allocation, showing that adjusting the timing between primer and booster significantly impacts epidemic outcomes and can determine whether the disease persists or disappears.</description>

      <title>On measure problems in allometric analysis of cities -- How to correctly understand the law of allometric growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The law of allometric growth originated from biology has been widely used in urban research for a long time. Some conditional research conclusions based on biological phenomena have been erroneously transmitted in the field of urban geography, leading to some misunderstandings. One of the misunderstandings is that allometric analysis must be based on average measure. The aim of this paper is at explaining how to correctly understand the law of urban allometric growth by means of the methods of literature analysis and mathematical analysis. The results show the average measures cannot be applied to all types of allometric relationships, and the allometric relationships based on average measures cannot be derived from a general principle. Whether it is an empirical model or a theoretical model of allometric growth, its generation and derivation are independent of the average measures. Conclusions can be reached that the essence of allometric growth lies in that the ratio of two related general relative growth rates is a constant, and this constant represents the allometric scaling exponent and fractal dimension ratio. The average measures are helpful to estimate the allometric scaling exponent value which accords with certain theoretical expectations more effectively.</description>

      <title>City riots fed by transnational and trans-topic web-of-influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sudden emergence of large-scale riots in otherwise unconnected cities across the UK in summer 2024 came as a shock for both government officials and citizens. Irrespective of these riots' specific trigger, a key question is how the capacity for such widespread city rioting might be foreseen through some precursor behavior that flags an emerging appetite for such rioting at scale. Here we show evidence that points toward particular online behavior which developed at scale well ahead of the riots, across the multi-platform landscape of hate/extremist communities. Our analysis of detailed multi-platform data reveals a web-of-influence that existed well before the riots, involving online hate and extremism communities locally, nationally, and globally. This web-of-influence fed would-be rioters in each city mainly through video platforms. This web-of-influence has a persistent resilience -- and hence still represents a significant local, national, and international threat in the future -- because of its feedback across regional-national-international scales and across topics such as immigration; and its use of multiple lesser-known platforms that put it beyond any single government or platform's reach. Going forward, our findings mean that if city administrators coordinate with each other across local-national-international divides, they can map this threat as we have done here and initiate deliberation programs that might then soften such pre-existing extremes at scale, perhaps using automated AI-based technology.</description>

      <title>Travel Time Reliability in Stochastic Kinematic Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the time-dependent relationship between the mean and variance of travel time on a single corridor under rush hour like congestion patterns. To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR ((Lighthill &amp; Whitham, 1955), (Richards, 1956)) theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous bottleneck at its downstream end, assuming a uni-modal demand profile with a stochastic peak. We establish conditions for typical counterclockwise hysteresis loops under these assumptions. It is demonstrated that shapes of the fundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be interpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations may occur under defensive driving. This classification enables a detailed explanation of the qualitative physical mechanisms behind this pattern, as well as an analysis of the causes for quantitatively limited deviations. Some of the mathematical properties of the LWR model identified in our analysis have not yet been addressed in the literature and we critically examine the extent to which these reflect actual traffic flow behavior. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments. The obtained results aim to improve the fundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern and to facilitate its better estimation in traffic planning and control.</description>

      <title>Connecting the geometry and dynamics of many-body complex systems with message passing neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between scale transformations and dynamics established by renormalization group techniques is a cornerstone of modern physical theories, from fluid mechanics to elementary particle physics. Integrating renormalization group methods into neural operators for many-body complex systems could provide a foundational inductive bias for learning their effective dynamics, while also uncovering multiscale organization. We introduce a scalable AI framework, ROMA (Renormalized Operators with Multiscale Attention), for learning multiscale evolution operators of many-body complex systems. In particular, we develop a renormalization procedure based on neural analogs of the geometric and laplacian renormalization groups, which can be co-learned with neural operators. An attention mechanism is used to model multiscale interactions by connecting geometric representations of local subgraphs and dynamical operators. We apply this framework in challenging conditions: large systems of more than 1M nodes, long-range interactions, and noisy input-output data for two contrasting examples: Kuramoto oscillators and Burgers-like social dynamics. We demonstrate that the ROMA framework improves scalability and positive transfer between forecasting and effective dynamics tasks compared to state-of-the-art operator learning techniques, while also giving insight into multiscale interactions. Additionally, we investigate power law scaling in the number of model parameters, and demonstrate a departure from typical power law exponents in the presence of hierarchical and multiscale interactions.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Open-Weight AI Model Growth on Hugging Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferate-with model development, significant investment, and user interest-it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight model's influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parameters-immediacy, longevity, and relative fitness-to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.</description>

      <title>Finding Influential Cores via Normalized Ricci Flows in Directed and Undirected Hypergraphs with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Salaries of Researchers with Motivational Emergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of scientific policy and science management, this study examines the system of nonuniform wage distribution for researchers. A nonlinear mathematical model of optimal remuneration for scientific workers has been developed, considering key and additive aspects of scientific activity: basic qualifications, research productivity, collaborative projects, skill enhancement, distinctions, and international collaborations. Unlike traditional linear schemes, the proposed approach is based on exponential and logarithmic dependencies, allowing for the consideration of saturation effects and preventing artificial wage growth due to mechanical increases in scientific productivity indicators.
  The study includes detailed calculations of optimal, minimum, and maximum wages, demonstrating a fair distribution of remuneration on the basis of researcher productivity. A linear increase in publication activity or grant funding should not lead to uncontrolled salary growth, thus avoiding distortions in the motivational system. The results of this study can be used to reform and modernize the wage system for researchers in Kazakhstan and other countries, as well as to optimize grant-based science funding mechanisms. The proposed methodology fosters scientific motivation, long-term productivity, and the internationalization of research while also promoting self-actualization and ultimately forming an adequate and authentic reward system for the research community.
  Specifically, in resource-limited scientific systems, science policy should focus on the qualitative development of individual researchers rather than quantitative expansion (e.g., increasing the number of scientists). This can be achieved through the productive progress of their motivation and self-actualization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting classical epidemiological models with information from the social sciences helps unveil the interplay between contagion dynamics and social responses. However, multidisciplinary integration of social analysis and epidemiological modelling is often challenging, due to scarcity of vast and reliable data sources and because ad hoc modelling assumptions may not reproduce empirically observed patters. Here, we test the hypothesis that awareness and information spreading straightforwardly translates into behavioural responses, analysing empirical data to generate insights about their dynamics and relationships. We employ such results to build a data-informed behavioural-epidemiological model that elucidates the impact of compliant behaviours and the role of centralised regulations in mitigating epidemics. We investigate model properties and its benefits in integrating theoretical modelling and data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Traffic Patterns with Percolation Theory: A Case Study of Seoul Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban traffic systems are characterized by dynamic interactions between congestion and free-flow states, influenced by human activity and road topology. This study employs percolation theory to analyze traffic dynamics in Seoul, focusing on the transition point $q_c$ and Fisher exponent $\tau$. The transition point $q_c$ quantifies the robustness of the free-flow clusters, while the exponent $\tau$ captures the spatial fragmentation of the traffic networks. Our analysis reveals temporal variations in these metrics, with lower $q_c$ and lower $\tau$ values during rush hours representing low-dimensional behavior. Weight-weight correlations are found to significantly impact cluster formation, driving the early onset of dominant traffic states. Comparisons with uncorrelated models highlight the role of real-world correlations. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating traffic resilience and informs strategies to optimize urban transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond 2050: From deployment to renewal of the global solar and wind energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global energy transition depends on large-scale photovoltaic (PV) and wind power deployment. While 2050 targets suggest a transition endpoint, maintaining these systems beyond mid-century requires continuous renewal, marking a fundamental yet often overlooked shift in industrial dynamics. This study examines the transition from initial deployment to long-term renewal, using a two-phase growth model: an exponential expansion followed by capacity stabilization. By integrating this pattern with a Weibull distribution of PV panel and wind turbine lifespans, we estimate the annual production required for both expansion and maintenance. Our findings highlight two key factors influencing production dynamics: deployment speed and lifespan. When deployment occurs faster than the average lifespan, production overshoots and exhibits damped oscillations due to successive installation and replacement cycles. In contrast, gradual deployment leads to a smooth increase before stabilizing at the renewal rate. Given current scenarios, the PV industry is likely to experience significant oscillations - ranging from 15 % to 60 % of global production - while wind power follows a monotonic growth trajectory. These oscillations, driven by ambitious energy targets, may result in cycles of overproduction and underproduction, affecting industrial stability. Beyond solar and wind, this study underscores a broader challenge in the energy transition: shifting from infrastructure expansion to long-term maintenance. Addressing this phase is crucial for ensuring the resilience and sustainability of renewable energy systems beyond 2050.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling (QT) effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of QT. I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognise optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favour of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimised for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.</description>
