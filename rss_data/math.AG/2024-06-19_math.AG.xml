      <description>arXiv:2406.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and $X$ be a smooth projective surface over $k$ with a rational point, we discuss the condition of splitting off the top cell for the motivic stable homotopy type of $X$. We also study some outlying examples, such as K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the irreducibility of Hessian loci of cubic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of the irreducibility of the Hessian variety $\mathcal{H}_f$ associated with a smooth cubic hypersurface $V(f)\subset \mathbb{P}^n$. We prove that when $n\leq5$, $\mathcal{H}_f$ is normal and irreducible if and only if $f$ is not of Thom-Sebastiani type, i.e., roughly, one can not separate its variables. This also generalizes a result of Beniamino Segre dealing with the case of cubic surfaces. The geometric approach is based on the study of the singular locus of the Hessian variety and on infinitesimal computations arising from a particular description of these singularities.</description>

      <title>Curves on complete intersections and measures of irrationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimal degrees and gonalities of curves on complete intersections. We prove a classical conjecture which asserts that the degree of any curve on a general complete intersection $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^N$ cut out by polynomials of large degrees is bounded from below by the degree of $X$. As an application, we verify a conjecture of Bastianelli--De Poi--Ein--Lazarsfeld--Ullery on measures of irrationality for complete intersections.</description>

      <title>Universal polynomials for multi-singularity loci of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we prove the existence of universal polynomials which express multi-singularity loci classes of prescribed types for proper morphisms between smooth schemes over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero -- we call them Thom polynomials for multi-singularity types of maps. It has been referred to as the Thom-Kazarian principle and unsolved for a long time. This result solidifies the foundation for a general enumerative theory of singularities of maps which is applicable to a broad range of problems in classical and modern algebraic geometry. In particular, it would contribute to a satisfactory answer to the rest of (an advanced form of) Hilbert's 15th problem and connect such classics to recent new interests in enumerations inspired by mathematical physics and other fields. A main feature of our proof is a striking use of algebro-geometric cohomology operations. Somewhat surprisingly, when trying to grasp a full perspective of classical enumerative geometry, we will inevitably encounter algebraic cobordism and motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-invariants via Quot schemes I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the virtual Euler characteristics of sheaves over Quot schemes of curves, establishing that these invariants fit into a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) valued in $\mathbb{Z}[[q]]$. Utilizing Quot scheme compactifications alongside the TQFT framework, we derive presentations of the small quantum $K$-ring of the Grassmannian. Our approach offers a new method for finding explicit formulas for quantum $K$-invariants.</description>

      <title>On the BCSS Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chapter 10 of the 1998 Springer-Verlag book {\em Complexity and Real Computation}, by Blum, Cucker, Shub, and Smale, contains a particularly elegant proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: The central idea of the proof naturally leads to a homotopy continuation algorithm for finding the roots of univariate polynomials, and extends naturally to a proof B\'{e}zout's Theorem (on the number of roots of systems of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns). We present a more detailed version of the BCSS Proof which is hopefully useful for those new to algebraic geometry. Any errors here are solely the responsibility of the current author.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-type invariants for complex smooth quasi-projective varieties -- a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex smooth quasi-projective variety with an epimorphism $\nu \colon \pi_1(X)\twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n$. We survey recent developments about the asymptotic behaviour of Betti numbers with any field coefficients and the order of the torsion part of singular integral homology of finite abelian covers of $X$ associated to $\nu$, known as the $L^2$-type invariants. We give relations between $L^2$-type invariants, Alexander invariants and cohomology jump loci. When $\nu$ is orbifold effective, we give explicit formulas for $L^2$-invariants at homological degree one in terms of geometric information of $X$. We also propose several related open questions for hyperplane arrangement complement.</description>

      <title>Limits of nodal surfaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X\to\mathbb D$ be a flat family of projective complex 3-folds over a disc $\mathbb D$ with smooth total space $\mathcal X$ and smooth general fibre $\mathcal X_t,$ and whose special fiber $\mathcal X_0$ has double normal crossing singularities, in particular, $\mathcal X_0=A\cup B$, with $A$, $B$ smooth threefolds intersecting transversally along a smooth surface $R=A\cap B.$ In this paper we first study the limit singularities of a $\delta$--nodal surface in the general fibre $S_t\subset\mathcal X_t$, when $S_t$ tends to the central fibre in such a way its $\delta$ nodes tend to distinct points in $R$. The result is that the limit surface $S_0$ is in general the union $S_0=S_A\cup S_B$, with $S_A\subset A$, $S_B\subset B$ smooth surfaces, intersecting on $R$ along a $\delta$-nodal curve $C=S_A\cap R=S_B\cap B$. Then we prove that, under suitable conditions, a surface $S_0=S_A\cup S_B$ as above indeed deforms to a $\delta$--nodal surface in the general fibre of $\mathcal X\to\mathbb D$. As applications we prove that there are regular irreducible components of the Severi variety of degree $d$ surfaces with $\delta$ nodes in $\mathbb P^3$, for every $\delta\leq {d-1\choose 2}$ and of the Severi variety of complete intersection $\delta$-nodal surfaces of type $(d,h)$, with $d\geq h-1$ in $\mathbb P^4$, for every $\delta\leq {{d+3}\choose 3}-{{d-h+1}\choose 3}-1.$</description>

      <title>Mirror partner for a Klein quartic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of A.Chiodo, Y.Ruan and M.Krawitz associate the mirror partner Calabi-Yau variety $X$ to a Landau--Ginzburg orbifold $(f,G)$ if $f$ is an invertible polynomial satisfying Calabi-Yau condition and the group $G$ is a diagonal symmetry group of $f$. In this paper we investigate the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds with a Klein quartic polynomial $f = x_1^3x_2 + x_2^3x_3+x_3^3x_1$ and $G$ being all possible subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{C})$, preserving the polynomial $f$ and also the pairing in its Jacobian algebra. In particular, $G$ is not necessarily abelian or diagonal. The zero-set of polynomial $f$, called Klein quartic, is a genus $3$ smooth compact Riemann surface. We show that its mirror Landau-Ginzburg orbifold is $(f,G)$ with $G$ being a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-extension of a Klein four-group.</description>

      <title>On a p-adic version of Narasimhan and Seshadri's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a smooth projective curve C of genus g over a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic 0 and residue field \Fbar_p. Motivated by Narasimhan and Seshadri's theorem, Faltings asked whether all semistable vector bundles of degree 0 over C_{\C_p} are in the image of the p-adic Simpson correspondence. Works of Deninger-Werner and Xu show that this is equivalent for the vector bundle to having potentially strongly semistable reduction. We prove that if C has good reduction, p&gt;r(r-1) (g-1) and we consider a vector bundle of rank r with stable reduction, the conditions of having potentially strongly semistable reduction and of having strongly semistable reduction are equivalent. In particular, we provide a negative answer to Faltings' question</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface, and let ${\mathcal Q}(r,d)$ denote the quot scheme parametrizing the torsion quotients of ${\mathcal O}^{\oplus r}_X$ of degree $d$. Given a projective structure $P$ on $X$, we show that the cotangent bundle $T^*{\mathcal U}$ of a certain nonempty Zariski open subset ${\mathcal U}\, \subset\, {\mathcal Q}(r,d)$, equipped with the natural Liouville symplectic form, admits a canonical deformation quantization. When $r\,=\,1\,=\, d$, then ${\mathcal Q}(r,d)\,=\, X$; this case was addressed earlier in \cite{BB}.</description>

      <title>On the Prym map for cyclic covers of genus two curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.06264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Prym map assigns to each covering of curves a polarized abelian variety. In the case of unramified cyclic covers of curves of genus two, we show that the Prym map is ramified precisely on the locus of bielliptic covers. The key observation is that we can naturally associate to such a cover an abelian surface with a cyclic polarization, and then the codifferential of the Prym map can be interpreted in terms of multiplication of sections on the abelian surface. Furthermore, we give a different proof of a result by Ramanan that a genus two cyclic cover of degree sufficiently high is never hyperelliptic.</description>

      <title>$G$-torsors on perfectoid spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any rigid analytic group variety $G$ over a non-archimedean field $K$ over $\mathbb Q_p$, we study $G$-torsors on adic spaces over $K$ in the $v$-topology. Our main result is that on perfectoid spaces, $G$-torsors in the \'etale and $v$-topology are equivalent. This generalises the known cases of $G=\mathbb G_a$ and $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$ due to Scholze and Kedlaya--Liu.
  On a general adic space $X$ over $K$, where there can be more $v$-topological $G$-torsors than \'etale ones, we show that for any open subgroup $U\subseteq G$, any $G$-torsor on $X_v$ admits a reduction of structure group to $U$ \'etale-locally on $X$. This has applications in the context of the $p$-adic Simpson correspondence: For example, we use it to show that on any adic space, generalised $\mathbb Q_p$-representations are equivalent to $v$-vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal and Linear Regressions and Pencils of Confocal Quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper enhances and develops bridges between statistics, mechanics, and geometry. For a given system of points in $\mathbb R^k$ representing a sample of full rank, we construct an explicit pencil of confocal quadrics with the following properties: (i) All the hyperplanes for which the hyperplanar moments of inertia for the given system of points are equal, are tangent to the same quadrics from the pencil of quadrics. As an application, we develop regularization procedures for the orthogonal least square method, analogues of lasso and ridge methods from linear regression. (ii) For any given point $P$ among all the hyperplanes that contain it, the best fit is the tangent hyperplane to the quadric from the confocal pencil corresponding to the maximal Jacobi coordinate of the point $P$; the worst fit among the hyperplanes containing $P$ is the tangent hyperplane to the ellipsoid from the confocal pencil that contains $P$. The confocal pencil of quadrics provides a universal tool to solve the restricted principal component analysis restricted at any given point. Both results (i) and (ii) can be seen as generalizations of the classical result of Pearson on orthogonal regression. They have natural and important applications in the statistics of the errors-in-variables models (EIV). For the classical linear regressions we provide a geometric characterization of hyperplanes of least squares in a given direction among all hyperplanes which contain a given point. The obtained results have applications in restricted regressions, both ordinary and orthogonal ones. For the latter, a new formula for test statistic is derived. The developed methods and results are illustrated in natural statistics examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any smooth proper rigid analytic space $X$ over a complete algebraically closed extension of $\mathbb Q_p$, we construct a $p$-adic Simpson correspondence: an equivalence of categories between vector bundles on Scholze's pro-\'etale site of $X$ and Higgs bundles on $X$. This generalises a result of Faltings from smooth projective curves to any higher dimension, and further to the rigid analytic setup. The strategy is new, and is based on the study of rigid analytic moduli spaces of pro-\'etale invertible sheaves on spectral varieties.</description>

Abstract: We present an effective global generation result for direct images of pluricanonical bundles in mixed characteristic.

As an application, we establish a weak positivity statement for the relative canonical sheaf of a smooth morphism in mixed characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that odd-dimensional projective varieties with tilting objects and only ADE-hypersurface singularities are nodal, i.e. they only have $A_1$-singularities. This is a very special case of more general obstructions to the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions for projective Gorenstein varieties. More precisely, for many isolated hypersurface singularities, we show that Kuznetsov-Shinder's categorical absorptions of singularities cannot contain tilting objects. The key idea is to compare singularity categories of projective varieties to singularity categories of finite-dimensional associative Gorenstein algebras. The former often contain special generators, called cluster-tilting objects, which typically have loops and $2$-cycles in their quivers. In contrast, quivers of cluster-tilting objects in the latter categories, can never have loops or $2$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order of O'Grady's tenfolds and cubic fourfolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a lattice-theoretic classification of non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of OG10 type. We determine which automorphisms are induced by a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order of a cubic fourfold on the associated LSV manifolds, giving a geometric and lattice-theoretic description of the algebraic and transcendental lattices of the cubic fourfold. As an application we discuss the rationality conjecture for a general cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and deformations of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties can have moduli. To be precise, suppose $X$ is a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of codimension 1 in the flag variety $G/B$, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group of rank $r$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and $B$ is a Borel subgroup. We show that the space $\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)$ of first order deformations of $X$ has dimension $r-1$ except in type $A_2$. (In type $A_2$, the Hessenberg varieties in question are all isomorphic to the permutohedral toric surface, and $\mathrm{dim}\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)=0$.) Moreover, we show that the Kodaira-Spencer map $\mathfrak{g}\to\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)$ is onto, that the connected component of the automorphism group of $X$ is the maximal torus of $G$, and that $\mathrm{H}^i(X,TX)=0$ for $i\geq2$. Along the way, we prove several theorems of independent interest about the cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles on $G/B$.
  In type $A$, we can give an even more precise statement determining when two codimension $1$ regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties in $G/B$ are isomorphic. We also compute the automorphism groups explicitly in type $A_{n-1}$ in the terms of stabilizer subgroups of the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the moduli space $M_{0,n+1}$ of smooth genus $0$ curves with $n+1$ marked points. Using this, we describe the moduli stack of the regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties $X$ explicitly as a quotient stack of $M_{0,n+1}$.
  We prove several analogous results for Hessenberg varieties in generalized flag varieties $G/P$, where $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $G$. In type $A$, these results are used in the proofs of the results for $G/B$, but they are also independently interesting because the associated moduli stacks are related directly to the action of $S_n$ on $M_{0,n}$.</description>

      <title>A new spin on Hurwitz theory and ELSV via theta characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spin Hurwitz numbers, which count ramified covers of the Riemann sphere with a sign coming from a theta characteristic. These numbers are known to be related to Gromov-Witten theory of K\"ahler surfaces and to representation theory of the Sergeev group, and are generated by BKP tau-functions. We use the latter interpretation to give polynomiality properties of these numbers and we derive a spectral curve which we conjecture computes spin Hurwitz numbers via a new type of topological recursion. We prove that this conjectural topological recursion is equivalent to an ELSV-type formula, expressing spin Hurwitz numbers in terms of the Chiodo class twisted by the $2$-spin Witten class.</description>

      <title>Blowup algebras of determinantal ideals in prime characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study when blowup algebras are $F$-split or strongly $F$-regular. Our main focus is on algebras given by symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals of minors of a generic matrix, a symmetric matrix, and a Hankel matrix. We also study ideals of Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix. We use these results to obtain bounds on the degrees of the defining equations for these algebras. We also prove that the limit of the normalized regularity of the symbolic powers of these ideals exists and that their depth stabilizes. Finally, we show that, for determinantal ideals, there exists a monomial order for which taking initial ideals commutes with taking symbolic powers. To obtain these results we develop the notion of $F$-split filtrations and symbolic $F$-split ideals.</description>

      <title>Cyclic products of higher-genus Szeg\"o kernels, modular tensors and polylogarithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wealth of information on multiloop string amplitudes is encoded in fermionic two-point functions known as Szeg\"o kernels. In this paper we show that cyclic products of any number of Szeg\"o kernels on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus may be decomposed into linear combinations of modular tensors on moduli space that carry all the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. The $\delta$-independent coefficients in these combinations carry all the dependence on the marked points and are composed of the integration kernels of higher-genus polylogarithms. We determine the antiholomorphic moduli derivatives of the $\delta$-dependent modular tensors.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Model for Coordinated Multi-Satellite Joint Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite communication is one of the key technologies that is enabling next-generation networks. However, nearest-satellite-supported downlink transmission may not meet a user's requirements due to limited signal strength, especially in emergent scenarios. In this paper, we investigate a coordinated multi-satellite joint transmission system from a system-level perspective, where a user can be served by multiple satellites to improve its quality-of-service (QoS). Furthermore, we analyze the coverage and rate of a typical user in the joint transmission system. Simulation and numerical results show that the introduced system achieves a higher coverage probability than the traditional nearest-satellite-supported network. Moreover, a user's ergodic rate can be maximized by selecting an appropriate number of serving satellites.</description>

      <title>Exact Flux Vacua, Symmetries, and the Structure of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying flux vacua in string theory with stabilized complex structure moduli presents a significant challenge, necessitating the minimization of a scalar potential complicated by infinitely many exponential corrections. In order to obtain exact results we connect three central topics: transcendentality or algebraicity of coupling functions, emergent symmetries, and the distribution of vacua. Beginning with explicit examples, we determine the first exact landscape of flux vacua with a vanishing superpotential within F-theory compactifications on a genuine Calabi-Yau fourfold. We find that along certain symmetry loci in moduli space the generically transcendental vacuum conditions become algebraic and can be described using the periods of a K3 surface. On such loci the vacua become dense when we do not bound the flux tadpole, while imposing the tadpole bound yields a small finite landscape of distinct vacua. Away from these symmetry loci, the transcendentality of the fourfold periods ensures that there are only a finite number of vacua with a vanishing superpotential, even when the tadpole constraint is removed. These observations exemplify the general patterns emerging in the bulk of moduli space that we expose in this work. They are deeply tied to the arithmetic structure underlying flux vacua and generalize the finiteness claims about rational CFTs and rank-two attractors. From a mathematical perspective, our study is linked with the recent landmark results by Baldi, Klingler, and Ullmo about the Hodge locus that arose from connecting tame geometry and Hodge theory.</description>
