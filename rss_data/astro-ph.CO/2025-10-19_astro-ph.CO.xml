      <title>Bridging observations and simulations: a machine learning approach to galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) records the history of galaxy clusters through its complex dynamical properties. To effectively interpret these properties, robust methods are needed to compare observational data with theoretical models. We present a novel machine learning framework for comparing ICM line-of-sight velocity maps derived from X-ray observations. Our approach uses convolutional and Siamese neural networks to identify similarities between different kinematic fields. We outline the architecture of this framework and perform a series of sanity checks to validate its performance. These checks demonstrate the model's ability to correctly identify and quantify kinematic features, establishing a powerful new tool for future comparative studies of the ICM.</description>

      <title>Multi-species Dark Matter with Warmth and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general analytic framework for the evolution of cosmic structure in multi-species dark matter models that simultaneously incorporates finite velocity dispersion and Poisson fluctuations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary numbers of dark matter components with distinct mass fractions, velocity distributions, and number densities -- ranging from cold particles to warm species and sparse populations such as primordial black holes or solitons. The framework is based on solving a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, whose solution is obtained by solving Volterra integral equations. We provide an efficient algorithm to solve for the total, as well as inter- and intra-species power spectra. Worked examples with two-component mixtures illustrate how isocurvature (initially Poisson) and adiabatic spectra evolve differently depending on the properties of the warm or sparse fraction. This evolution is controlled by the free-streaming and Jeans scales, and the results match analytic estimates and $N$-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Implications of a high growth index on the variation of $G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent determination of the growth index indicates a value significantly higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting that alternative scenarios to $\Lambda$CDM may be required. In this work, we investigate whether a time-varying Newton's constant, $G_N$, can account for such a high growth index, $\gamma=0.063\pm0.025$. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we study two parameterizations of the effective gravitational coupling, $G_{\rm eff}$, one based on a Taylor expansion and another linked to the energy density parameter of Dark Energy. We constrain the models with Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations (data release 2), CMB priors, and a gaussian likelihood for the growth index. We show that the constant $\gamma$ approximation is accurate for the parametrization linked to the energy density parameter of dark energy, but presents a non-negligible error for the other case, which we treat as a systematic error in the analysis. We find a $2.4\sigma-3.4\sigma$ tension level with constant $G_{\rm eff}$, depending on the parametrization. The results indicate that $G_{\rm eff}&lt;G_N$ around the period of accelerated expansion, corresponding to a weaker effective gravitational interaction on cosmological scales, which leads to a suppression of the growth of cosmological structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.</description>

      <title>Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_{\rm eff} = 1.725$ with the SDSS quasars catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the SDSS-DR16 quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the two-point angular correlation function with a statistical significance of $3\sigma$, at an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}=1.725$. Using a simple parameterization-comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function-we measure the transverse BAO scale as $\theta_{\rm BAO}=1.928^{\circ}\pm0.094^{\circ}$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., $\Delta z=0.01$), thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed fiducial cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible. When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows good concordance-within the $1\sigma$ confidence level-with the cosmological parameter values reported by the Planck and DESI collaborations. This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>A rising tide: Intrinsic alignments since the turn of the millennium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignments of galaxies across the large-scale structure of the Universe are known to be a source of contamination for gravitational lensing, but they can also probe cosmology and the physics of galaxy evolution in many ways. In this review, I cover developments in our understanding of intrinsic alignments over the past 25 years on: (1) different approaches to model intrinsic alignments across a range of scales, (2) existing observational constraints, (3) predictions from cosmological numerical $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations, (4) mitigation strategies to account for their contamination to lensing observables and (5) cosmological and astrophysical applications. While the review focuses mostly on two-point statistics of intrinsic alignments, I also give a summary of other statistics beyond two-point. Finally, I point out some of the open problems hindering the understanding or application of intrinsic alignments and how they might be overcome in the future.</description>

      <title>Impact of neutrino decays on the Cosmic Neutrino Background anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropies of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) offer an ideal tool to test non-standard neutrino interactions, since they directly trace the perturbations in the neutrino distribution function. Here, we study how invisible neutrino decays impact the C$\nu$B anisotropies, in a framework where neutrinos decay non-relativistically to dark radiation and lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. For this purpose, we perform the first implementation of such a late-time neutrino decay scenario within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver, and compute the C$\nu$B angular power spectra from the Boltzmann hierarchy solutions for a range of lifetimes and decay channels. We find that neutrino decays leave very strong signatures on the C$\nu$B angular spectra, about two orders of magnitude larger than on the CMB angular spectra, particularly for lifetimes comparable to the age of the Universe. We show that a future polarized tritium target run of the PTOLEMY experiment, with sufficient counting statistics to measure just the first $\sim 15$ multipoles of the neutrino sky map, could test neutrino decay models that remain undetectable with CMB data.</description>

      <title>The kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect as a benchmark for AGN feedback models in hydrodynamical simulations: insights from DESI + ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback remains one of the largest uncertainties in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, with different prescriptions producing divergent predictions for the fraction of gas expelled from halos, the radial extent of the gas expulsion and the impact on large scale matter clustering. We present the first systematic study of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect across a wide range of simulations (FLAMINGO, ANTILLES, BAHAMAS, SIMBA, FABLE and their variants), and compare them directly to DESI Year 1 + ACT kSZ measurements. We ensure a like-for-like comparison with observations by developing a robust methodology that accounts for the halo mass selection using galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic variance, miscentering and satellites, establishing the kSZ effect as a new benchmark for the simulations. We find that fiducial feedback models are disfavoured by &gt;3 sigma, while simulations with more powerful AGN feedback within the FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS suites, as well as SIMBA, reproduce the observed kSZ signal within &lt;2 sigma. We use the ANTILLES simulation suite to demonstrate that the amplitude of the kSZ effect is a strong predictor of matter power spectrum suppression, competitive with baryon fraction metrics. These results establish the kSZ as a critical probe for evaluating feedback physics and for advancing the fidelity of cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino mass and dark energy agnostic to the sound horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent BAO observations from DESI DR2 either hint at a possible dynamical dark energy component, which would worsen the Hubble tension, or at a 95\% credible interval for the summed neutrino mass hardly compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=76.0^{+4.5}_{-4.3}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=129.2^{+6.7}_{-8.1}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt;1.6$ eV (95\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>Atomic Quantum Sensors for High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves represent an unexplored frontier of gravitational physics. While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and ground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz scale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in which gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong magnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in a cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple channels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms, microwave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell electronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability, compute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral strain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-22}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-37}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical Raman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain unconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving primordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and (p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets, and quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Hints for dynamical dark energy from warm inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of dissipation from the thermal bath of minimal warm inflation (MWI) on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is investigated. A shift in the phase and peaks of the theoretical TT mode angular power spectrum of CMB for MWI with increasing dissipation strength hints at the dynamical nature of dark energy from warm inflation. Outcome of the study highlights the necessity of modifying the cosmological parameters, signalling a physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. The current findings may open a new direction for explaining the increased expansion rate in the early universe, thus alleviating some of the persistent tensions in cosmology, especially the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Effects of Radiative Corrections on Starobinsky Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze radiative corrections to the Starobinsky model of inflation arising from self-interactions of the inflaton, and from its Yukawa couplings, $y$, to matter fermions, and dimensionful trilinear couplings, $\kappa$, to scalar fields, which could be responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation. The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations, $n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions in the Einstein frame: $y &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; y &lt; 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} &lt; T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker constraints. Planck data also imply a constraint on a trilinear inflaton coupling to light scalars in the Einstein frame: $\kappa \leq 4 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$, corresponding to $T_{\rm RH} \leq 4.2 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$. We further present constraints on inflaton couplings to massive fermions and scalars, and analyze constraints on couplings in the Jordan frame.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem", namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.</description>

      <title>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) - VI: $\gamma$-ray Emission in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions, which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model, a sensitivity of $F_\gamma &lt; 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.</description>

      <title>A cross-bispectrum estimator for CMB-HI intensity mapping correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity mapping of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen promises to be a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the post-reionisation epoch. However, HI intensity mapping (IM) experiments will suffer the loss of long-wavelength line-of-sight HI modes in the foreground subtraction process. This significantly reduces HI IM cross-correlations with projected large-scale structure tracers, such as CMB secondary anisotropies. Here we propose a cross-bispectrum estimator, $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21} \delta T_{21}},$ to recover the cross-correlation of the HI IM field, $\delta T_{21},$ with the CMB lensing field, $\kappa,$ constructed by correlating the position-dependent HI power spectrum with the mean overdensity traced by CMB lensing. We study the cross-bispectrum estimator in the squeezed limit and forecast its detectability based on HI IM measurements from HIRAX and CMB lensing measurements from Advanced ACT. We find that $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21}\delta T_{21}},$ in combination with the HI IM and CMB lensing auto-spectra, can place sub-percent constraints on the growth rate of fluctuations, $f,$ and the small scale amplitude of fluctuations, $ \sigma_8.$ The cross-bispectrum, in combination with the auto-spectra and Planck priors, improves dark energy constraints to 0.025 on $w_0$ and 0.12 on $w_a$ for flat models. These results are robust to HI foreground removal because they derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-CMB lensing cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find a tight constraint of 12.1 meV (15.8 meV) on the sum of neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a flat $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) model.</description>

      <title>Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) &gt; 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) &lt; 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.</description>

      <title>Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. We show that young progenitors with an age of less than 1 Myr are consistent with our inferred distribution of host DM at 95 percent confidence. These young sources may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article arXiv:2405.10937v2, we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. arXiv:1911.12066. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gaussian Process Kernels Using Nested Sampling and ABC Rejection for H(z) Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider possible observable signals from explosive events in the very early universe, ``bursts". These could be expected in connection
  with massive black hole or ``baby universe'' formation. We anticipate that such major disruptions of spacetime would be associated with
  neutrino and perhaps other pulses. While these seem to be not
  detectable directly, we discuss how they could lead to potentially observable signals. We analyze how the pulses from very early times
  may ``escape'', that is
  propagate to the last scattering epoch at the time $t_{cmb}$ and later,
  or alternatively be absorbed earlier, ``contained''. The possibly detectable signals include effects on small regions of the CMB, a soft x-ray resulting from positron production, or a nonthermal addition to
  the relic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>

      <title>Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and its proposed successor AMS-100, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that AMS-02 will have sensitivity to gamma-ray polarization only for the brightest steady-state Galactic sources, such as the Vela and Geminga pulsars; it is not expected to be capable of detecting polarization in Galactic or extragalactic sources that have been previously proposed as good targets for ALP searches with gamma-ray intensity measurements. However, AMS-100 observing the extragalactic source NGC1275 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for unfavorable B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</description>

      <title>WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may exist today and be candidates for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via the Hawking radiation of PBHs, and PBHs that survived Hawking evaporation via the memory burden effect. Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. This paper shows that a small memory burden is preferable if the thermal production of WIMPs or FIMPs is much larger than the effect of PBH particle production via Hawking radiation. In addition, we show that the lower limit of the DM mass, called the warm DM (WDM) constraint, decreases with the memory burden effect of PBHs. Results suggest that the WDM constraint is more effective for FIMPs than for WIMPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of extragalactic dark matter to the local dark matter density and flux in the Milky Way. By analyzing the Galactic escape velocity as a function of direction, we establish the criterion for separating dark matter particles bound to the Milky Way and those originating from the Local Group environment. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of dark matter particles in the Solar neighborhood have an extragalactic origin, contributing nearly 38% of the total mass flux. The directional dependence of this extragalactic component shows significant anisotropy across the sky, with implications for direct detection experiments. We provide quantitative predictions for detection rates and signatures that could help identify the extragalactic dark matter component in current and future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if we consider freeze-in of Dark Walker coupled to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. This provides a simple yet predictive example linking strongly coupled inflationary dynamics to present-day dark matter.</description>

      <title>AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>

Abstract: We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9&lt;\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)&lt;48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z = 3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} &gt; 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} &gt; {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies ($&gt;{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.</description>

      <title>III. Interacting Dark Energy: Summary of Models, Pathologies, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.</description>
