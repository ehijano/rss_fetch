      <title>Exploring the Non-Markovian Dynamics in Depolarizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Markovian depolarizing channel is explored from the perspective of understanding its non-Markovian behaviour as well as the occurrence of singularities. The study brings together the various ways to identify and quantify non-Markovianity. This includes dynamical techniques such as quantum information backflow witness, BLP, RHP and HCLA measures. In addition, geometrical visualization of non-Markovian effects is presented using the variation in the volume of accessible states during dynamical evolution. Further, a trajectory-based visualization of the dynamical map, of the depolarizing channel, within the parameter space is presented. The trajectories traced during evolution, demonstrate the loss of CP-divisibility and the emergence of non-Markovianity under systematic variations of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>A Simple QUBO Formulation of Sudoku</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes how to solve Sudoku puzzles using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). To this end, a QUBO instance with 729 variables is constructed, encoding a Sudoku grid with all constraints in place, which is then partially assigned to account for clues. The resulting instance can be solved with a Quantum Annealer, or any other strategy, to obtain the fully filled-out Sudoku grid. Moreover, as all valid solutions have the same energy, the QUBO instance can be used to sample uniformly from the space of valid Sudoku grids. We demonstrate the described method using both a heuristic solver and a Quantum Annealer.</description>

      <title>Complexity-constrained quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process's complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state's complexity entropy. The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the complexity relative entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer's ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy and determine the complexity entropy's behavior under random circuits. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a complexity conditional entropy, which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee. Overall, our framework extends the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics to integrate a notion of time, as quantified by complexity.</description>

      <title>Playing nonlocal games across a topological phase transition on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum games provide a natural perspective on phases of matter in quantum hardware, crisply relating the quantum correlations inherent in phases of matter to the securing of quantum advantage at a device-oriented task. In this paper we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging mid-circuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition - witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage - on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed GHZ states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.</description>

      <title>Quantum PCPs: on Adaptivity, Multiple Provers and Reductions to Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exists (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation from athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic constraints on the pivotal task of entanglement generation using out-of-equilibrium states through a model-independent framework with minimal assumptions. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a thermal process to generate bipartite qubit entanglement, starting from an initially separable state. Consequently, we identify the set of system states that cannot be entangled, when no external work is invested. In the regime of infinite temperature, we analytically construct this set; while for finite temperature, we provide a simple criterion to verify whether any given initial state is or is not entanglable. Furthermore, we provide an explicit construction of the future thermal cone of entanglement - the set of entangled states that a given separable state can thermodynamically evolve to. We offer a detailed discussion on the properties of this cone, focusing on the interplay between entanglement and its volumetric properties. We conclude with several key remarks on the generation of entanglement beyond two-qubit systems, and discuss its dynamics in the presence of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality under imperfect teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wavefunction transfer under imperfect teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wavefunction, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection $(i)$ preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, $(ii)$ weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and $(iii)$ obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a `built-in' decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors -- highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.</description>

      <title>Hardware-efficient ansatz without barren plateaus in any depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have recently gained much interest due to their relevance in real-world applications, such as combinatorial optimizations, quantum simulations, and modeling a probability distribution. Despite their huge potential, the practical usefulness of those circuits beyond tens of qubits is largely questioned. One of the major problems is the so-called barren plateaus phenomenon. Quantum circuits with a random structure often have a flat cost-function landscape and thus cannot be trained efficiently. In this paper, we propose two novel parameter conditions in which the hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) is free from barren plateaus for arbitrary circuit depths. In the first condition, the HEA approximates to a time-evolution operator generated by a local Hamiltonian. Utilizing a recent result by [Park and Killoran, Quantum 8, 1239 (2024)], we prove a constant lower bound of gradient magnitudes in any depth both for local and global observables. On the other hand, the HEA is within the many-body localized (MBL) phase in the second parameter condition. We argue that the HEA in this phase has a large gradient component for a local observable using a phenomenological model for the MBL system. By initializing the parameters of the HEA using these conditions, we show that our findings offer better overall performance in solving many-body Hamiltonians. Our results indicate that barren plateaus are not an issue when initial parameters are smartly chosen, and other factors, such as local minima or the expressivity of the circuit, are more crucial.</description>

      <title>We can catalyse it for you thermally: Catalytic transformations for thermal operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the fundamental limits and advantages of using a catalyst to aid thermodynamic transformations between quantum systems? In this work, we answer this question by focusing on transformations between energy-incoherent states under the most general energy-conserving interactions among the system, the catalyst, and a thermal environment. The sole constraint is that the catalyst must return unperturbed and uncorrelated with the other subsystems. More precisely, we first characterise the set of states to which a given initial state can thermodynamically evolve (the catalysable future) or from which it can evolve (the catalysable past) with the help of a strict catalyst. Secondly, we derive lower bounds on the dimensionality required for the existence of catalysts under thermal process, along with bounds on the catalyst's state preparation. Finally, we quantify the catalytic advantage in terms of the volume of the catalysable future and demonstrate its utility in an exemplary task of generating entanglement using thermal resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient algorithm for determining optimal adaptive quantum estimation protocols with arbitrary quantum control operations between subsequent uses of a probed channel.We introduce a tensor network representation of an estimation strategy, which drastically reduces the time and memory consumption of the algorithm, and allows us to analyze metrological protocols involving up to $N=50$ qubit channel uses, whereas the state-of-the-art approaches are limited to $N&lt;5$. The method is applied to study the performance of the optimal adaptive metrological protocols in presence of various noise types, including correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Variational Quantum Algorithm for Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical and chemical processes in the condensed phase environment exhibit non-Markovian quantum dynamics. As such simulations are challenging on classical computers, we developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian dynamics on NISQ devices. We used a quantum system linearly coupled to its harmonic bath as the model Hamiltonian. The non-Markovianity is captured by introducing auxiliary variables from the bath trajectories. With Monte Carlo sampling of the bath degrees of freedom, finite temperature dynamics is produced. We validated the algorithm on the simulator and demonstrated its performance on the IBM quantum device. The framework developed is naturally adapted to any anharmonic bath with non-linear coupling to the system, and is also well suited for simulating spin chain dynamics in a dissipative environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) schemes suitable for circuits with a polynomial number of $T/T^{\dagger}$-gates to Grover's algorithm, performing a simulation in Qiskit of a Grover circuit that contains 3 qubits. The $T/T^{\dagger}$ gate complexity of Grover's algorithm is also analysed in order to show that any Grover circuit can be evaluated homomorphically in an efficient manner. We discuss how to apply these QHE schemes to allow for the efficient homomorphic evaluation of any Grover circuit composed of $n$ qubits using $n-2$ extra ancilla qubits. We also show how the homomorphic evaluation of the special case where there is only one marked item can be implemented using an algorithm that makes the decryption process more efficient compared to the standard Grover algorithm.</description>

      <title>Photonic simulation of Majorana-based Jones polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jones polynomials were introduced as a tool to distinguish between topologically different links. Recently, they emerged as the central building block of topological quantum computation: by braiding non-Abelian anyons it is possible to realise quantum algorithms through the computation of Jones polynomials. So far, it has been a formidable task to evaluate Jones polynomials through the control and manipulation of non-Abelian anyons. In this study, a photonic quantum system employing two-photon correlations and non-dissipative imaginary-time evolution is utilized to simulate two inequivalent braiding operations of Majorana zero modes. The resulting amplitudes are shown to be mathematically equivalent to Jones polynomials at a particular value of their parameter. The high-fidelity of our optical platform allows us to distinguish between a wide range of links, such as Hopf links, Solomon links, Trefoil knots, Figure Eight knots and Borromean rings, through determining their corresponding Jones polynomials. Our photonic quantum simulator represents a significant step towards executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms based on topological quantum encoding and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Scar Models in One Dimensional Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum many-body scars has received widespread attention both in theoretical and experimental physics in recent years due to its unique physical properties. In this paper, based on the $su(2)$ algebraic relations, we propose a general method for constructing scar models by combining simple modules.This allows us to investigate many-body scar phenomena in high-spin systems. We numerically verify the thermalization and non-integrability of this model and demonstrate the dynamical properties of the scar states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of these scar states. For spin-$1$ case, we find that our 1D chain model reduces to the famous PXP model[C. J. Turner et al. Phys. Rev. B 98, 155134(2018)] under special parameter condition. In addition, due to the continuous tunability of the parameters, our model also enables us to investigate the transitions of QMBS from non-integrable to integrable system.</description>

      <title>Efficient Measurement of the Bi-photon Spatial Mode Entanglement with Stimulated Emission Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of stimulated emission tomography (SET) provides excellent characterization of SPDC sources of bi-photon states since it increases the average number of photons detected by several orders of magnitude than the traditional coincidence counting method. In a SET experiment, the signal caused by the vacuum fluctuation in SPDC is replaced by a more intense prepared seed with the same mode properties, resulting in an amplification of the corresponding idler. Based on this idea, our experiment uses the difference frequency generation (DFG), a purely classical second-order nonlinear process, to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an entangled photon pair produced by a Type-II SPDC crystal. We inject the seed beam at 780 nm with different Laguerre-Gaussian modes together with a pump beam at 405 nm into a Type-II BBO crystal and measure the Laguerre-Gaussian mode distribution of the idler at 842 nm. We observe a strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the OAM spectrum. We expect that this experiment paves the way for the efficient measurement of bi-photon wavefunctions produced by ultra-thin SPDC sources and also the characterization of high-dimensional entangled photon pairs produced in SPDC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical analysis of the Adiabatic Quantum Computation protocol presents several challenges resulting from the difficulty of simulating, with classical resources, the unitary dynamics of a large quantum device. We present here a variational approach to substantially alleviate this problem in many situations of interest. Our approach is based on the time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo method, in conjunction with a correlated and time-dependent Jastrow ansatz. We demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained in a variety of problems, ranging from the description of defect generation through a dynamical phase transition in 1D to the complex dynamics of frustrated spin-glass problems both on fully-connected and Chimera graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QRAO (Quantum Random Access Optimization) is a relaxation algorithm that reduces the number of qubits required to solve a problem by encoding multiple variables per qubit using QRAC (Quantum Random Access Code). Reducing the number of qubits is a common way of dealing with the impact of noise on a quantum algorithm. Our interest lies in the impact of noise on the quality of the binary solution of QRAO, which is unknown. We demonstrate that the mean approximation ratio of the (3, 1)-QRAC Hamiltonian, i.e., the Hamiltonian utilizing the encoding of 3 bits into 1 qubit by QRAC, is less affected by noise compared to the Ising Hamiltonian used in quantum annealer and QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm). Based on this observation, we discuss a plausible mechanism behind the robustness of QRAO under depolarizing noise. Finally, we assess the number of shots required to estimate the values of binary variables correctly under depolarizing noise and show that the (3, 1)-QRAC Hamiltonian requires less shots to achieve the same accuracy compared to the Ising Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-pair correlations in spontaneous parametric down conversion are ubiquitous in quantum photonics. The ability to engineer their properties for optimising a specific task is essential, but often challenging in practice. We demonstrate the shaping of spatial correlations between entangled photons in the form of arbitrary amplitude and phase objects. By doing this, we encode image information within the pair correlations, making it undetectable by conventional intensity measurements. It enables the transmission of complex, high-dimensional information using quantum correlations of photons, which can be useful for developing quantum communication and imaging protocols.</description>

      <title>Generic ETH: Eigenstate Thermalization beyond the Microcanonical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has played a key role in recent advances in the high energy and condensed matter communities. It explains how an isolated quantum system in a far-from-equilibrium initial state can evolve to a state that is indistinguishable from thermal equilibrium, with observables relaxing to almost time-independent results that can be described using traditional statistical mechanics ensembles. In this work we probe the limits of ETH, pushing it outside its prototypical applications in several directions. We design a qutrit lattice system with conserved quasilocal charge, in which we verify a form of generalized eigenstate thermalization. We also observe signatures of thermalization in states well outside microcanonical windows of both charge and energy, which we dub `generic ETH.'</description>

      <title>Maximal Non-Kochen-Specker Sets and a Lower Bound on the Size of Kochen-Specker Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kochen-Specker (KS) set is a finite collection of vectors on the two-sphere containing no antipodal pairs for which it is impossible to assign 0s and 1s such that no two orthogonal vectors are assigned 1 and exactly one vector in every triplet of mutually orthogonal vectors is assigned 1. The existence of KS sets lies at the heart of Kochen and Specker's argument against non-contextual hidden variable theories and the Conway-Kochen free will theorem. Identifying small KS sets can simplify these arguments and may contribute to the understanding of the role played by contextuality in quantum protocols. In this paper we derive a weak lower bound of 10 vectors for the size of any KS set by studying the opposite notion of large non-KS sets and using a probability argument that is independent of the graph structure of KS sets. We also point out an interesting connection with a generalisation of the moving sofa problem around a right-angled hallway on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement in the diagonal symmetric subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in the symmetric subspace of $N$-partite $d$-dimensional systems (qudits). For diagonal symmetric states, we show that there is no bound entanglement for $d = 3,4 $ and $N = 3$. Further, we present a constructive algorithm to map multipartite diagonal symmetric states of qudits onto bipartite symmetric states of larger local dimension. This technique greatly simplifies the analysis of multipartite states and allows to infer entanglement properties for any even $N \geq 4 $ due to the fact that the PPT conditions that arise from the bipartite symmetric state correspond to the same PPT conditions that appear in the multipartite diagonal symmetric state.</description>

      <title>On Representing Electronic Wave Functions with Sign Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent neural networks demonstrated impressively accurate approximations of electronic ground-state wave functions. Such neural networks typically consist of a permutation-equivariant neural network followed by a permutation-antisymmetric operation to enforce the electronic exchange symmetry. While accurate, such neural networks are computationally expensive. In this work, we explore the flipped approach, where we first compute antisymmetric quantities based on the electronic coordinates and then apply sign equivariant neural networks to preserve the antisymmetry. While this approach promises acceleration thanks to the lower-dimensional representation, we demonstrate that it reduces to a Jastrow factor, a commonly used permutation-invariant multiplicative factor in the wave function. Our empirical results support this further, finding little to no improvements over baselines. We conclude with neither theoretical nor empirical advantages of sign equivariant functions for representing electronic wave functions within the evaluation of this work.</description>

      <title>Quantum error cancellation in photonic systems -- undoing photon losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real photonic devices are subject to photon losses that can decohere quantum information encoded in the system. In the absence of full fault tolerance, quantum error mitigation techniques have been introduced to help manage errors in noisy quantum devices. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation protocol inspired by probabilistic error cancellation (a popular error mitigation technique in discrete variable systems) for continuous variable systems. We show that our quantum error cancellation protocol can undo photon losses in expectation value estimation tasks. To do this, we analytically derive the (non-physical) inverse photon loss channel and decompose it into a sum over physically realisable channels with potentially negative coefficients. The bias of our ideal expectation value estimator can be made arbitrarily small at the cost of increasing the sampling overhead. The protocol requires a noiseless amplification followed by a series of photon-subtractions. While these operations can be implemented probabilistically, for certain classes of initial state one can avoid the burden of carrying out the amplification and photon-subtractions by leveraging Monte-Carlo methods to give an unbiased estimate of the ideal expectation value. We validate our proposed mitigation protocol by simulating the scheme on squeezed vacuum states, cat states and entangled coherent states.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing For High Performance Computing Using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of exascale computing, effective load balancing in massively parallel software applications is critically important for leveraging the full potential of high performance computing systems. Load balancing is the distribution of computational work between available processors. Here, we investigate the application of quantum annealing to load balance two paradigmatic algorithms in high performance computing. Namely, adaptive mesh refinement and smoothed particle hydrodynamics are chosen as representative grid and off-grid target applications. While the methodology for obtaining real simulation data to partition is application specific, the proposed balancing protocol itself remains completely general. In a grid based context, quantum annealing is found to outperform classical methods such as the round robin protocol but lacks a decisive advantage over more advanced methods such as steepest descent or simulated annealing despite remaining competitive. The primary obstacle to scalability is found to be limited coupling on current quantum annealing hardware. However, for the more complex particle formulation, approached as a multi-objective optimization, quantum annealing solutions are demonstrably Pareto dominant to state of the art classical methods across both objectives. This signals a noteworthy advancement in solution quality which can have a large impact on effective CPU usage.</description>

      <title>Approaching the double-Heisenberg-scaling sensitivity in the Tavis-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum-enhanced parameter estimations without the need for nonclassical initial states has long been driven by the goal of achieving experimentally accessible quantum metrology. In this paper, employing a coherent averaging mechanism, we prove that the prototypical cavity-quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, such as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, enables us to achieve not only the Heisenberg scaling (HS) precision in terms of the average photon number but also the double-HS sensitivity concerning both the average photon and atom numbers. Such a double sensibility can be experimentally realized by introducing either photon- or atom-number fluctuations through quantum squeezing. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology to achieve this double-HS precision in a realistic experimental circumstance where the squeezing is not perfect. Our results provide insights into understanding the coherent averaging mechanism for evaluating quantum-enhanced precision measurements and also present a usable metrological application of the cavity QED systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of cooling a Markovian quantum system to a pure state in the shortest amount of time possible. Here the system drift takes the form of a Lindblad master equation and we assume fast unitary control. This setting allows for a natural reduction of the control system to the eigenvalues of the state density matrix. We give a simple necessary and sufficient characterization of systems which are (asymptotically) coolable and present a powerful result which allows to considerably simplify the search for optimal cooling solutions. With these tools at our disposal we derive explicit provably time-optimal cooling protocols for rank one qubit systems, inverted $\Lambda$-systems on a qutrit, and a certain system consisting of two coupled qubits.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Dynamical Decoupling for Enhanced Crosstalk Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is one of the simplest error suppression methods, aiming to enhance the coherence of qubits in open quantum systems. Moreover, DD has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing coherent crosstalk, one major error source in near-term quantum hardware, which manifests from two types of interactions. Static crosstalk exists in various hardware platforms, including superconductor and semiconductor qubits, by virtue of always-on qubit-qubit coupling. Additionally, driven crosstalk may occur as an unwanted drive term due to leakage from driven gates on other qubits. Here we explore a novel staggered DD protocol tailored for multi-qubit systems that suppresses the decoherence error and both types of coherent crosstalk. We develop two experimental setups - an "idle-idle" experiment in which two pairs of qubits undergo free evolution simultaneously and a "driven-idle" experiment in which one pair is continuously driven during the free evolution of the other pair. These experiments are performed on an IBM Quantum superconducting processor and demonstrate the significant impact of the staggered DD protocol in suppressing both types of coherent crosstalk. When compared to the standard DD sequences from state-of-the-art methodologies with the application of X2 sequences, our staggered DD protocol enhances circuit fidelity by 16.9% and 8.5%, respectively, in addressing these two crosstalk types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete reducibility property for bipartite states reduced the separability problem to a proper subset of positive under partial transpose states and was used to prove several theorems inside and outside entanglement theory. So far only three types of bipartite states were proved to possess this property. In this work, we provide some procedures to create states with this property, we call these states by the name of completely reducible states. The convex combination of such states is the first procedure, showing that the set of completely reducible states is a convex cone. We also provide a complete description of the extreme rays of this set. Then we show that powers, roots and partial traces of completely reducible states result in states of the same type. Finally, we consider a shuffle of states that preserves this property. This shuffle allow us to construct states with the complete reducibility property avoiding the only three conditions known to date that imply this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering pragmatic and efficient approaches to synthesize $\varepsilon$-approximations to quantum operators such as real (imaginary) time-evolution propagators in terms of the basic quantum operations (gates) is challenging. These invaluable $\varepsilon$-approximations enable the compilation of classical and quantum algorithms modeling, e.g., dynamical properties. In parallel, symmetries are powerful tools concisely describing the fundamental laws of nature; the symmetrical underpinnings of physical laws having consistently provided profound insights and substantially increased predictive power. In this work, we consider the interplay between $\varepsilon$-approximations processes and symmetries in a semi-coherent context--where measurements occur at each logical clock cycle. We draw inspiration from Pascual Jordan's groundbreaking formulation of non-associative, but commutative, algebraic forms. Our symmetrized formalism is applied in various domains such as quantum random walks, real-time-evolutions, variational algorithms ansatzes, and efficient entanglement verification. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding and greater appreciation of how symmetries can be used to control quantum dynamics in the near-term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum harmonic oscillators model a wide variety of phenomena ranging from electromagnetic fields to vibrations of atoms in molecules. Their excitations can be represented by bosons such as photons, single particles of light, or phonons, the quanta of vibrational energy. Linear interactions that only create and annihilate single bosons can generate coherent states of light or motion. Introducing nth-order nonlinear interactions, that instead involve n bosons, leads to increasingly complex quantum behaviour. For example, second-order interactions enable squeezing, used to enhance the precision of measurements beyond classical limits, while higher-order interactions create non-Gaussian states essential for continuous-variable quantum computation. However, generating nonlinear interactions is challenging, typically requiring higher-order derivatives of the driving field or specialized hardware. Hybrid systems, where linear interactions couple an oscillator to an additional spin, offer a solution and are readily available across many platforms. Here, using the spin of a single trapped ion coupled to its motion, we employ two linear interactions to demonstrate up to fourth-order bosonic interactions; we focus on generalised squeezing interactions and demonstrate squeezing, trisqueezing, and quadsqueezing. We characterise these interactions, including their spin dependence, and reconstruct the Wigner function of the resulting states. We also discuss the scaling of the interaction strength, where we drive the quadsqueezing interaction more than 100 times faster than using conventional techniques. Our method presents no fundamental limit in the interaction order n and applies to any platform supporting spin-dependent linear interactions. Strong higher-order nonlinear interactions unlock the study of fundamental quantum optics, quantum simulation, and computation in a hitherto unexplored regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science has opened up new frontiers in our understanding of processes happening on the intrinsic timescale of electrons. The ability to manipulate and observe phenomena at the attosecond level has yielded groundbreaking insights into processes such as electron dynamics and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. This interdisciplinary field bridges various research areas such as quantum optics, quantum chemistry and quantum information science facilitating a cohesive understanding. However, despite many emerging successful applications, the discussion about intrinsic quantum effects has mainly been ignored. In this Perspective, we explore the latest advancements in quantum phenomena within attosecond science, encompassing both experimental and theoretical progress. Specifically, in the context of high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization, we focus on discerning genuinely quantum observations and distinguishing them from classical phenomena. Additionally, we illuminate the often overlooked yet significant role of entanglement in attosecond processes, elucidating its influence on experimental outcomes.</description>

      <title>Slow Light Augmented Unbalanced Interferometry for Extreme Enhancement in Sensitivity of Measuring Frequency Shift in a Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) which can be used to enhance very significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift in a laser. The degree of enhancement depends on the group index of the slow-light medium, the degree of imbalance between the physical lengths of the two arms of the MZI, and the spectral width of the laser. For a laser based on a high-finesse cavity, yielding a narrow quantum noise limited spectral width, the group index has to be larger than the finesse in order to achieve enhancement in measurement sensitivity. For the reported results, strong slow-light effect is produced by employing electro-magnetically induced transparency via coherent population trapping in a buffer-gas loaded vapor cell of Rb atoms, with a maximum group index of ~1759. The observed enhancement in sensitivity for a range of group indices agrees well with the theoretical model. The maximum enhancement factor observed is ~22355, and much larger values can be obtained using cold atoms for producing the slow-light effect, for example. The sensitivity of any sensor that relies on measuring the frequency shift of a laser can be enhanced substantially using this technique. These include, but are not limited to, gyroscopes and accelerometers based on a conventional ring laser or a superluminal ring laser, and detectors for virialized ultra-light field dark matter. We also show how similar enhancements can be achieved in a slow-light augmented unbalanced Michelson interferometer.</description>

      <title>Quantum bounds for compiled XOR games and $d$-outcome CHSH games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal games play a crucial role in quantum information theory and have numerous applications in certification and cryptographic protocols. Kalai et al. (STOC 2023) introduced a procedure to compile a nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive proof, using a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, and showed that their compilation method preserves the classical bound of the game. Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS 2023) then showed that the quantum bound is preserved for the specific case of the CHSH game. Extending the proof techniques of Natarajan and Zhang, we show that the compilation procedure of Kalai et al. preserves the quantum bound for two classes of games: XOR games and d-outcome CHSH games. We also establish that, for any pair of qubit measurements, there exists an XOR game such that its optimal winning probability serves as a self-test for that particular pair of measurements.</description>

      <title>The role of polaron dressing in superradiant emission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative effects of multiple quantum emitters are characterized by transitions via delocalized collective states with altered emission properties due to the existence of inter-emitter coherences. When realized with excitonic condensed matter nanostructures, these effects are significantly affected by the presence of strong emitter-phonon coupling, which leads to the formation of polarons. We show that, while for single-emitter emission into free space this formation has no impact on its radiative lifetime, the same is not true for superradiant emission. Considering the case of two indistinguishable quantum emitters, we analyse how polaron dressing affects collective photon emission by mixing bright and dark Dicke states. Our numerical simulations show that this mixing crucially depends on the circumstances of the excitation of the system: Depending on the pulse length of an exciting laser, one can choose to either prepare polaronic Dicke states, or bare electronic Dicke states, changing the superradiant decay characteristics of the system. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for these limiting cases, which match the results of numerically exact calculations.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Potential applications of quantum dots in the nanotechnology industry make these systems an important field of study in various areas of physics. In particular, thermodynamics has a significant role in technological innovations. With this in mind, we studied some thermodynamic properties in quantum dots, such as entropy and heat capacity, as a function of the magnetic field over a wide range of temperatures. The density of states plays an important role in our analyses. At low temperatures, the variation in the magnetic field induces an oscillatory behavior in all thermodynamic properties. The depopulation of subbands is the trigger for the appearance of the oscillations.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, has been widely utilized in high energy physics and has shown remarkable results in various applications. Moreover, the concept of machine learning has been extended to quantum computers, giving rise to a new research area known as quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel variational quantum circuit model, Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN), designed for learning complete graphs. We argue that QCGNN has a polynomial speedup against its classical counterpart, due to the property of quantum parallelism. In this paper, we study the application of QCGNN through the challenging jet discrimination, where the jets are represented with complete graphs. Subsequently, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical graph neural networks to establish a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development in Rydberg-atomic detection of microwave fields has paved the way to a new type of intrinsically calibrated RF measurements. The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g.~weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining most of the sensitivity. We tackle the issue of uncorrelated laser phase, emerging in this type of detection, by facilitating separate measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and using the results in post-processing. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field, while comparing with the state of the art (although not all-optical) method realized in the same setup.</description>

      <title>Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with undetected photons from high-gain spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is an indispensable analytical method that allows label-free identification of substances via fundamental molecular vibrations. However, the sensitivity of FTIR is often limited by the low efficiency of mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors. SU(1,1) interferometry has previously enabled FTIR with undetected MIR photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in the low-parametric-gain regime, where the number of photons per mode is much less than one and sensitive photodetectors are needed. In this work, we develop a high-parametric-gain SU(1,1) interferometer for MIR-range FTIR with undetected photons. Using our new method, we demonstrate three major advantages: a high photon number at the interferometer output, a considerably lower photon number at the sample, and improved interference contrast. In addition, we analyze different methods to broaden the spectral range of the interferometer by aperiodic poling and temperature gradient in the gain medium. Exploiting the broadband SU(1,1) interferometer, we measure and evaluate the MIR absorption spectra of polymers in the 3-{\mu}m region.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem for generalized-noncontextual ontological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.07161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is useful to have a criterion for when the predictions of an operational theory should be considered classically explainable. Here we take the criterion to be that the theory admits of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. Existing works on generalized noncontextuality have focused on experimental scenarios having a simple structure: typically, prepare-measure scenarios. Here, we formally extend the framework of ontological models as well as the principle of generalized noncontextuality to arbitrary compositional scenarios. We leverage a process-theoretic framework to prove that, under some reasonable assumptions, every generalized-noncontextual ontological model of a tomographically local operational theory has a surprisingly rigid and simple mathematical structure -- in short, it corresponds to a frame representation which is not overcomplete. One consequence of this theorem is that the largest number of ontic states possible in any such model is given by the dimension of the associated generalized probabilistic theory. This constraint is useful for generating noncontextuality no-go theorems as well as techniques for experimentally certifying contextuality. Along the way, we extend known results concerning the equivalence of different notions of classicality from prepare-measure scenarios to arbitrary compositional scenarios. Specifically, we prove a correspondence between the following three notions of classical explainability of an operational theory: (i) existence of a noncontextual ontological model for it, (ii) existence of a positive quasiprobability representation for the generalized probabilistic theory it defines, and (iii) existence of an ontological model for the generalized probabilistic theory it defines.</description>

      <title>Can Error Mitigation Improve Trainability of Noisy Variational Quantum Algorithms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are often viewed as the best hope for near-term quantum advantage. However, recent studies have shown that noise can severely limit the trainability of VQAs, e.g., by exponentially flattening the cost landscape and suppressing the magnitudes of cost gradients. Error Mitigation (EM) shows promise in reducing the impact of noise on near-term devices. Thus, it is natural to ask whether EM can improve the trainability of VQAs. In this work, we first show that, for a broad class of EM strategies, exponential cost concentration cannot be resolved without committing exponential resources elsewhere. This class of strategies includes as special cases Zero Noise Extrapolation, Virtual Distillation, Probabilistic Error Cancellation, and Clifford Data Regression. Second, we perform analytical and numerical analysis of these EM protocols, and we find that some of them (e.g., Virtual Distillation) can make it harder to resolve cost function values compared to running no EM at all. As a positive result, we do find numerical evidence that Clifford Data Regression (CDR) can aid the training process in certain settings where cost concentration is not too severe. Our results show that care should be taken in applying EM protocols as they can either worsen or not improve trainability. On the other hand, our positive results for CDR highlight the possibility of engineering error mitigation methods to improve trainability.</description>

Abstract: A novel optical method for distinguishing chiral molecules is proposed and validated within a quantum simulator employing a trapped-ion qudit. This approach correlates the sign disparity of the dipole moment of chiral molecules with distinct cyclic evolution trajectories, yielding the unity population contrast induced by the different non-Abelian holonomies corresponding to the chirality. Harnessing the principles of holonomic quantum computation (HQC), our method achieves highly efficient, non-adiabatic, and robust detection and separation of chiral molecules. Demonstrated in a trapped ion quantum simulator, this scheme achieves nearly 100% contrast between the two enantiomers in the population of a specific state, showcasing its resilience to the noise inherent in the driving field.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. While we intend to provide a broad overview of the literature on quantum reinforcement learning - our interpretation of this term will be clarified below - we put particular emphasis on recent developments. With a focus on already available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, these include variational quantum circuits acting as function approximators in an otherwise classical reinforcement learning setting. In addition, we survey quantum reinforcement learning algorithms based on future fault-tolerant hardware, some of which come with a provable quantum advantage. We provide both a birds-eye-view of the field, as well as summaries and reviews for selected parts of the literature.</description>

Abstract: Detection of entanglement through partial knowledge of the quantum state is a challenge to implement efficiently. Here we propose a separability criterion for detecting bipartite entanglement in arbitrary dimensional quantum states using partial moments of the realigned density matrix. Our approach enables detection of both distillable and bound entangled states through a common framework. We illustrate the efficiency of our method through examples of states belonging to both the above categories, which are not detectable using comparable other schemes relying on partial state information. The formalism of employing partial realigned moments proposed here is further shown to be effective for two-qubit systems too, with a slight modification of our separability criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantity that is the differential relative entropy between a generic Wigner function and a Gaussian one. We prove that said quantity is minimized with respect to its Gaussian argument, if both Wigner functions in the argument of the Wigner differential entropy have the same first and second moments, i.e., if the Gaussian argument is the Gaussian associate of the other, generic Wigner function. Therefore, we introduce the differential relative entropy between any Wigner function and its Gaussian associate and we examine its potential as a non-Gaussianity measure. We prove that said quantity is faithful, invariant under Gaussian unitary operations, and find a sufficient condition on its monotonic behavior under Gaussian channels. We provide numerical results supporting aforesaid condition. The proposed, phase-space based non-Gaussianity measure is complex-valued, with its imaginary part possessing the physical meaning of the negative volume of the Wigner function. At the same time, the real part of this measure provides an extra layer of information, rendering the complex-valued quantity a measure of non-Gaussianity, instead of a quantity pertaining only to the negativity of the Wigner function. We examine the usefulness of our measure to non-Gaussian quantum state engineering with partial measurements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome the boundary of computationally hard problems. One of the cornerstones in modern optics is the beam propagation algorithm, facilitating the calculation of how waves with a particular dispersion relation propagate in time and space. This algorithm solves the wave propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is determined from the respective dispersion relation, which can often be expanded as a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires $\mathcal{O}(N log N)$ computation steps, where $N$ is the number of points into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation can be performed as a quantum algorithm with $\mathcal{O}((log{}N)^2)$ single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM) and perform such propagation in both one- and two-dimensional systems for the double-slit experiment and Gaussian beam propagation. We highlight the importance of the selection of suitable observables to retain the quantum advantage in the face of the statistical nature of the quantum measurement process, which leads to sampling errors that do not exist in classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Trajectory and its Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13587v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel approach to investigating entanglement in the context of quantum computing. Our methodology involves analyzing reduced density matrices at different stages of a quantum algorithm's execution and representing the dominant eigenvalue and von Neumann entropy on a graph, creating an "entanglement trajectory." To establish the trajectory's boundaries, we employ random matrix theory. Through the examination of examples such as quantum adiabatic computation, the Grover algorithm, and the Shor algorithm, we demonstrate that the entanglement trajectory remains within the established boundaries, exhibiting unique characteristics for each example. Moreover, we show that these boundaries and features can be extended to trajectories defined by alternative entropy measures. The entanglement trajectory serves as an invariant property of a quantum system, maintaining consistency across varying situations and definitions of entanglement. Numerical simulations accompanying this research are available via open access.</description>

Abstract: We present a cascaded variational quantum eigensolver algorithm that only requires the execution of a set of quantum circuits once rather than at every iteration during the parameter optimization process, thereby increasing the computational throughput. This algorithm uses a quantum processing unit to probe the needed probability mass functions and a classical processing unit perform the remaining calculations, including the energy minimization. The ansatz form does not restrict the Fock space and provides full control over the trial state, including the implementation of symmetry and other physically motivated constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing in Tweezer Arrays: Optical Magnetometry on an Individual-Atom Sensor Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a scalable platform for quantum sensing comprising hundreds of sites capable of holding individual laser-cooled atoms and demonstrate the applicability of this single-quantum-system sensor array to magnetic-field mapping on a two-dimensional grid. With each atom being confined in an optical tweezer within an area of 0.5 micrometer^2 at mutual separations of 7.0(2) micrometer, we obtain micrometer-scale spatial resolution and highly parallelized operation. An additional steerable optical tweezer allows for a rearrangement of atoms within the grid and enables single-atom scanning microscopy with sub-micron resolution. This individual-atom sensor platform finds its immediate application in mapping an externally applied DC gradient magnetic field. In a Ramsey-type measurement, we obtain a field resolution of 98(29) nanotesla. We estimate the sensitivity to 25 microtesla/Hz^1/2.</description>

Abstract: We give a construction of public key quantum money, and even a strengthened version called quantum lightning, from abelian group actions, which can in turn be constructed from suitable isogenies over elliptic curves. We prove security in the generic group model for group actions under a plausible computational assumption, and develop a general toolkit for proving quantum security in this model. Along the way, we explore knowledge assumptions and algebraic group actions in the quantum setting, finding significant limitations of these assumptions/models compared to generic group actions.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic error mitigation for quantum eigenvalues estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating the eigenvalues of a given observable, even fault-tolerant quantum computers will be subject to errors, namely algorithmic errors. These stem from approximations in the algorithms implementing the unitary passed to phase estimation to extract the eigenvalues, e.g. Trotterisation or qubitisation. These errors can be tamed by increasing the circuit complexity, which may be unfeasible in early-stage fault-tolerant devices. Rather, we propose in this work an error mitigation strategy that enables a reduction of the algorithmic errors up to any order, at the cost of evaluating the eigenvalues of a set of observables implementable with limited resources. The number of required observables is estimated and is shown to only grow polynomially with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, and in some cases, linearly with the desired order of error mitigation. Our results show error reduction of several orders of magnitude in physically relevant cases, thus promise accurate eigenvalue estimation even in early fault-tolerant devices with limited number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Telecloning on Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information can not be perfectly cloned, but approximate copies of quantum information can be generated. Quantum telecloning combines approximate quantum cloning, more typically referred as quantum cloning, and quantum teleportation. Quantum telecloning allows approximate copies of quantum information to be constructed by separate parties, using the classical results of a Bell measurement made on a prepared quantum telecloning state. Quantum telecloning can be implemented as a circuit on quantum computers using a classical co-processor to compute classical feed forward instructions using if statements based on the results of a mid-circuit Bell measurement in real time. We present universal, symmetric, optimal $1 \rightarrow M$ telecloning circuits, and experimentally demonstrate these quantum telecloning circuits for $M=2$ up to $M=10$, natively executed with real time classical control systems on IBM Quantum superconducting processors, known as dynamic circuits. We perform the cloning procedure on many different message states across the Bloch sphere, on $7$ IBM Quantum processors, optionally using the error suppression technique X-X sequence digital dynamical decoupling. Two circuit optimizations are utilized, one which removes ancilla qubits for $M=2, 3$, and one which reduces the total number of gates in the circuit but still uses ancilla qubits. Parallel single qubit tomography with MLE density matrix reconstruction is used in order to compute the mixed state density matrices of the clone qubits, and clone quality is measured using quantum fidelity. These results present one of the largest and most comprehensive NISQ computer experimental analyses on (single qubit) quantum telecloning to date. The clone fidelity sharply decreases to $0.5$ for $M &gt; 5$, but for $M=2$ we are able to achieve a mean clone fidelity of up to $0.79$ using dynamical decoupling.</description>

      <title>Making sense of relativistic Wigner friend scenarios: a problem for unitary accounts of quantum measurements ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner-friend scenarios -- in which external agents describe a closed laboratory containing a friend making a measurement -- highlight the difficulties inherent to quantum theory when accounting for measurements. In non-relativistic scenarios, the difficulty is to accommodate unitary evolution for a closed system with a definite outcome obtained by the friend. In relativistic scenarios the tensions between quantum theory and relativity induce additional constraints. A generic property of relativistic scenarios is the frame-dependence of state update upon a measurement. Based on a definite example, we will show that this property leads to inconsistent accounts for outcomes obtained in different reference frames. We will further argue that these results point to some fundamental inadequacy when attempting to model actions taken by a complex agent as unitary operations made on simple wavefunctions.</description>

Abstract: The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion technology, healthcare and astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state readout is a key requirement for a successful qubit platform. In this work we demonstrate a high fidelity quantum state readout of a V2 center nuclear spin based on a repetitive readout technique. We demonstrate up to 99.5$\,\%$ readout fidelity and 99$\,\%$ for state preparation. Using this efficient readout we initialise the nuclear spin by measurement and demonstrate its Rabi and Ramsey nutation. Finally, we use the nuclear spin as a long lived memory for quantum sensing application of weakly coupled diatomic nuclear spin bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) were introduced in 1974 by Wilson to study quark confinement. These models have been shown to exhibit (de-)confined phases, yet it remains challenging to define experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we propose percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) to probe confinement of dynamical matter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using electric field basis snapshots accessible to quantum simulators. We apply the POPs to study a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT and find a confining phase up to temperature $T=\infty$ in 2D (critical $T_c$, i.e. finite-$T$ phase transition, in 3D) for any non-zero density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. Further, using quantum Monte Carlo we demonstrate that the POPs reproduce the square lattice Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram at $T=0$ and explore the phase diagram at $T&gt;0$. The correlation length exponent coincides with the one of the 3D Ising universality class and we determine the POP critical exponent characterizing percolation. Our proposed POPs provide a geometric perspective of confinement and are directly accessible to snapshots obtained in quantum simulators, making them suitable as a probe for quantum spin liquids.</description>

Abstract: Problems in the field of open quantum systems often involve an environment that greatly impacts excitation dynamics. Here we show that there can be coherent coupling between different system states of a form that only occurs in a non-Markovian treatment of the bath. Because this involves entangled system-bath states, we demonstrate that there are distinct signatures of this physics in simple absorption spectra and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To do this we introduce a numerical method to simulate optical spectra of non-Markovian open quantum systems. The method employs a process tensor framework to efficiently compute multi-time correlation in a numerically exact way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but exact solutions are often hard to find. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of exactly solvable optimisation equations. For any quantity isomorphic to a location parameter, rules to devise optimal measurements are given in closed form. These are valid for any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. This framework unifies the metrology of locations, scales, and other parameter types such as relative weights, for which hyperbolic errors are required. But the central advantage lies on its simplifying power: searching for good strategies amounts to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant, irrespective of error bounds. This reduces the number of calculations needed in practice and enables the rigorous application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic evolution instead, an analysis of such a scheme is surprisingly missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state. At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example, the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea with a numerical simulation for a particular combinatorial optimization problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground states, arguing that the spectral gap is a crucial factor in determining the time scale of the cooling.</description>

Abstract: The advent of logical quantum processors marks the beginning of the early stages of error-corrected quantum computation. As a bridge between the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, these devices and their successors have the potential to revolutionize the solution of classically challenging problems. An important application of quantum computers is to calculate observables of quantum systems. This problem is crucial for solving quantum many-body and optimization problems. However, due to limited error correction capabilities, this new era are still susceptible to noise, thereby necessitating new quantum algorithms with polynomial complexity as well as noisy-resilency. This paper proposes a new noise-resilient and ansatz-free algorithm, called Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo. It utilizes the quantum Zeno effect and Monte Carlo integration for multi-step adiabatic transitions to the target eigenstates. It can efficiently find static as well as dynamic physical properties such as ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's function without the use of variational parameters. This algorithm offers a polynomial computational cost and quantum circuit depth that is significantly lower than the quantum phase estimation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold great promise for efficiently simulating Fermionic systems, benefiting fields like quantum chemistry and materials science. To achieve this, algorithms typically begin by choosing a Fermion-to-qubit mapping to encode the Fermioinc problem in the qubits of a quantum computer. In this work, we introduce "treespilation," a technique for efficiently mapping Fermionic systems using a large family of favourable tree-based mappings previously introduced by some of the authors. We use this technique to minimise the number of CNOT gates required to simulate chemical groundstates found numerically using the ADAPT-VQE algorithm. We observe significant reductions, up to $74\%$, in CNOT counts on full connectivity and for limited qubit connectivity-type devices such as IBM Eagle and Google Sycamore, we observe similar reductions in CNOT counts. In many instances, the reductions achieved on these limited connectivity devices even surpass the initial full connectivity CNOT count. Additionally, we find our method improves the CNOT and parameter efficiency of QEB- and qubit-ADAPT-VQE, which are, to our knowledge, the most CNOT-efficient VQE protocols for molecular state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal entanglement across the Mott-Hubbard transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility to directly measure, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, the von Neumann entropy and mutual information between a site and its environment opens new perspectives on the characterization of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, in the framework of quantum information theory. In this work we provide an alternative view of the Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model in terms of rigorous quasilocal measures of entanglement and correlation between two spatially separated electronic orbitals, with no contribution from their environment. A space-resolved analysis of cluster dynamical mean-field theory results elucidates the prominent role of the nearest-neighbor entanglement in probing Mott localization: both its lower and upper bounds sharply increase at the metal-insulator transition. The two-site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors is shown to be quickly damped as the inter-site distance is increased. These results ultimately resolve a conundrum of previous analyses based on the single-site von Neumann entropy, which has been found to monotonically decrease when the interaction is increased. The quasilocal two-site entanglement recovers instead the distinctive character of Mott insulators as strongly correlated quantum states, demonstrating its central role in the $2d$ Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Circuit realisation of a two-orbital non-Hermitian tight-binding chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a non-Hermitian (NH) tight-binding system comprising of two orbitals per unit cell and their electrical circuit analogues. We distinguish the PT-symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases characterised by non-reciprocal nearest neighbour couplings and onsite gain/loss terms, respectively. The localisation of the edge modes or the emergence of the topological properties are determined via the maximum inverse participation ratio, which has distinct dependencies on the parameters that define the Hamiltonian. None of the above scenarios exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect. We investigate the boundary modes corresponding to the topological phases in a suitably designed electrical circuit by analyzing the two-port impedance and retrieve the admittance band structure of the circuit via imposing periodic boundary conditions. The obtained results are benchmarked against the Hermitian version of the two-orbital model to compare and discriminate against those obtained for the NH variants.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nonlinear Response and Onsager Regression in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect' due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and, moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative photon condensates.</description>
