      <title>Strategic Collusion of LLM Agents: Market Division in Multi-Commodity Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning technologies are seeing increased deployment in real-world market scenarios. In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Strategic information disclosure with communication constraints and private preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social-media platforms are one of the most prevalent communication media today. In such systems, a large amount of content is generated and available to the platform. However, not all content can be transmitted to every possible user at all times. At the other end are the users, who have their own preferences about which content they enjoy, which is often unknown ex ante to the platform. We model the interaction between the platform and the users as a signaling game with asymmetric information, where each user optimizes its preference disclosure policy, and the platform optimizes its information disclosure policy. We provide structural as well as existence of policies that constitute Bayesian Nash Equilibria, and necessary optimality conditions used to explicitly compute the optimal policies.</description>

      <title>Individual Representation in Approval-Based Committee Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When selecting multiple candidates based on approval preferences of agents, the proportional representation of agents' opinions is an important and well-studied desideratum. Existing criteria for evaluating the representativeness of outcomes focus on groups of agents and demand that sufficiently large and cohesive groups are ''represented'' in the sense that candidates approved by some group members are selected. Crucially, these criteria say nothing about the representation of individual agents, even if these agents are members of groups that deserve representation. In this paper, we formalize the concept of individual representation (IR) and explore to which extent, and under which circumstances, it can be achieved. We show that checking whether an IR outcome exists is computationally intractable, and we verify that all common approval-based voting rules may fail to provide IR even in cases where this is possible. We then focus on domain restrictions and establish an interesting contrast between ''voter interval'' and ''candidate interval'' preferences. This contrast can also be observed in our experimental results, where we analyze the attainability of IR for realistic preference profiles.</description>

      <title>Settling the Score: Portioning with Cardinal Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a portioning setting in which a public resource such as time or money is to be divided among a given set of candidates, and each agent proposes a division of the resource. We consider two families of aggregation rules for this setting -- those based on coordinate-wise aggregation and those that optimize some notion of welfare -- as well as the recently proposed independent markets rule. We provide a detailed analysis of these rules from an axiomatic perspective, both for classic axioms, such as strategyproofness and Pareto optimality, and for novel axioms, some of which aim to capture proportionality in this setting. Our results indicate that a simple rule that computes the average of the proposals satisfies many of our axioms and fares better than all other considered rules in terms of fairness properties. We complement these results by presenting two characterizations of the average rule.</description>

      <title>MEV Sharing with Dynamic Extraction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a new frontier in the design of blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose making the MEV extraction rate as part of the protocol design space. Our aim is to leverage this parameter to maintain a healthy balance between block producers (who need to be compensated) and users (who need to feel encouraged to transact). We follow the approach introduced by EIP-1559 and design a similar mechanism to dynamically update the MEV extraction rate with the goal of stabilizing it at a target value. We study the properties of this dynamic mechanism and show that, while convergence to the target can be guaranteed for certain parameters, instability, and even chaos, can occur in other cases. Despite these complexities, under general conditions, the system concentrates in a neighborhood of the target equilibrium implying high long-term performance. Our work establishes, the first to our knowledge, dynamic framework for the integral problem of MEV sharing between extractors and users.</description>

      <title>Leximin and Leximax Fair Core Imputations for the Max-Flow, MST, and Bipartite $b$-Matching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable and fair division of profits/costs is a central concern in economics. The core, which ensures stability, has long been the gold standard for profit/cost sharing in cooperative games. Shapley and Shubik([SS71])'s classic work on the assignment game revealed that core imputations can be disproportionately favoring certain agents. Recent work ([Vaz24]) gave leximin and leximax core imputations for this game, achieving better fairness properties. We explore these fairness notions for the cores of three cooperative games: the max-flow game, the minimum spanning tree (MST) game, and the bipartite $b$-matching game. For all three games we give examples to show that an arbitrary core imputation can be excessively unfair to certain agents.
  Leximin and leximax core imputations are natural extensions of the widely used max-min and min-max fairness notions. We show that finding such imputations in the core is NP-hard for the max-flow and MST games, and likely so for $b$-matching as well. To address this, we introduce the concept of Dual-Consistent Core (DCC) imputations, which are characterized by solutions to the dual linear programs. We give polynomial time algorithms for computing leximin and leximax DCC imputations for all three games. These games have numerous applications and these imputations will provide a more fair way of distributing profit among agents for them.</description>

      <title>Paths to Equilibrium in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory, agents repeatedly interact and revise their strategies as new data arrives, producing a sequence of strategy profiles. This paper studies sequences of strategies satisfying a pairwise constraint inspired by policy updating in reinforcement learning, where an agent who is best responding in one period does not switch its strategy in the next period. This constraint merely requires that optimizing agents do not switch strategies, but does not constrain the non-optimizing agents in any way, and thus allows for exploration. Sequences with this property are called satisficing paths, and arise naturally in many MARL algorithms. A fundamental question about strategic dynamics is such: for a given game and initial strategy profile, is it always possible to construct a satisficing path that terminates at an equilibrium? The resolution of this question has implications about the capabilities or limitations of a class of MARL algorithms. We answer this question in the affirmative for normal-form games. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that reward deteriorating strategic updates are key to driving play to equilibrium along a satisficing path.</description>

      <title>Towards Replication-Robust Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite widespread adoption of machine learning throughout industry, many firms face a common challenge: relevant datasets are typically distributed amongst market competitors that are reluctant to share information. Recent works propose data markets to provide monetary incentives for collaborative machine learning, where agents share features with each other and are rewarded based on their contribution to improving the predictions others. These contributions are determined by their relative Shapley value, which is computed by treating features as players and their interactions as a characteristic function game. However, in its standard form, this setup further provides an incentive for agents to replicate their data and act under multiple false identities in order to increase their own revenue and diminish that of others, restricting their use in practice. In this work, we develop a replication-robust data market for supervised learning problems. We adopt Pearl's do-calculus from causal reasoning to refine the characteristic function game by differentiating between observational and interventional conditional probabilities. By doing this, we derive Shapley value-based rewards that are robust to this malicious replication by design, whilst preserving desirable market properties.</description>
