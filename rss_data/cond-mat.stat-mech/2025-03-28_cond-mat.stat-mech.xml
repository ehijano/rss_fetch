      <title>Fractal structure of Christ-Lee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper numerically investigates the dynamical properties of kink and antikink collisions in the Christ_Lee model in the regime of epsilon approaching the phi4 theory. With given epsilon and the initial velocity Vin, we exhibiting the formation of bion, scattering, and n_bounce states. Additionally, we show the self_similar fractal structures in the plot of Vout_Vin with given epsilon. Specially, we find the fractal structure in the plot of Vout versus epsilon, which is not reported previously. We computes the Box_counting dimension for these fractal structures. We find that the Box_dimension is positively correlated with epsilon, and approaches to Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle when epsilon is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>A General Solution for Network Models with Pairwise Edge Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Models with couplings between link pairs are the simplest models for a class of networks with Higher Order interactions. In this paper we give an analytic, general solution to this family of Random Graph Models extending previous results obtained for specific interaction structures. We use the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform to show that such higher order models can be decoupled into families of effectively separable random graph models, which might be enhanced with auxiliary, possibly multi-valued, parameters identifying the thermodynamical phase of the system. Moreover, given the diagonalizability of couplings between links, we carry out the full computation of the partition functions and discuss why in some cases they can effectively reduce to the one for the Mean-Field case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is argued the the idea of a single temperature-like variable, introduced in [1], which enters a generalized second law for Markovian open system in non-equilibrium environment is not sufficient for a consistent and useful thermodynamic formalism. The origin of the Second Law and ``local temperatures'' in Markovian theory of Quantum Open Systems is revisited and illustrated by simple examples.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Relations in Time-Dependent Temperatures and Time-Varying Forces: A Study of Entropy Production and Extraction Rates Governed by the Fokker-Planck Equation in Active Brownian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most previous works have focused on systems exposed to spatially varying forces and temperatures without looking at the role of time-dependent temperature or force fluctuations in active matter, molecular motors, and Brownian heat engines. However time varying temperature and forces regulate the efficiency and dissipation of molecular motors like kinesin, dynein, and myosin. Cooling of the system may slow ATP hydrolysis, reducing the transport efficiency while increasing dissipation. The performance of a Brownian heat engine can be affected by the cooling conditions. On other hand it is vital to consider the time-dependent force in ATP depletion, weakening optical tweezers, and energy loss in damped systems since this directly affects the motor dynamics and non-equilibrium transport. Thus, this time-dependent temperature or force considerably affects the transport efficiency, energy dissipation, and entropy production in non-equilibrium systems. In this work we examines the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of the system. By deriving analytical expressions for entropy production, entropy extraction, and dissipation rates, we extend the existing theoretical frameworks by considering, a force or temperature that varies exponentially, linearly, and quadratically.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to fluctuation theorems: from theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of physics, and over the years, it has evolved to include mesoscopic and out-of-equilibrium systems driven by theoretical and experimental advances at the micro- and nanoscale. This development has led to \textit{stochastic thermodynamics}, a framework that connects microscopic fluctuations with macroscopic laws. Despite their significance, fundamental ideas, such as fluctuation theorems, are frequently not covered in current curricula, leaving them largely unknown across many disciplines. Here, we present the core results of stochastic thermodynamics, particularly the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks theorem, using an integrated approach combining theoretical foundations with experimental verification using optical tweezers. This approach helps to clarify the fundamentals, linking theoretical ideas to real elements in the lab, showing the simplicity of the apparatus, and presenting detailed procedures for calibration and calculation of relevant quantities to enable the implementation of these experiments in new research and teaching laboratories. The goal is to enrich thermodynamics education and to stimulate exploration in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entanglement as a Magic Highway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions and high-dimensional chaos: comparing dynamics and statistics of equilibria in a solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and point out that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. We show that, for trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z=2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Least Squares as Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear least squares (LLS) is perhaps the most common method of data analysis, dating back to Legendre, Gauss and Laplace. Framed as linear regression, LLS is also a backbone of mathematical statistics. Here we report on an unexpected new connection between LLS and random walks. To that end, we introduce the notion of a random walk based on a discrete sequence of data samples (data walk). We show that the slope of a straight line which annuls the net area under a residual data walk equals the one found by LLS. For equidistant data samples this result is exact and holds for an arbitrary distribution of steps.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rejection-Free Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamic, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling and Family-Vicsek universality in $SU(N)$ quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Family-Vicsek scaling is a fundamental framework for understanding surface growth in non-equilibrium classical systems, providing a universal description of temporal surface roughness evolution. While universal scaling laws are well established in quantum systems, the applicability of Family-Vicsek scaling in quantum many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we investigate the infinite-temperature dynamics of one-dimensional $SU(N)$ spin chains, focusing on the well-known $SU(2)$ XXZ model and the $SU(3)$ Izergin-Korepin model. We compute the quantum analogue of classical surface roughness using the second cumulant of spin fluctuations and demonstrate universal scaling with respect to time and subsystem size. By systematically breaking global $SU(N)$ symmetry and integrability, we identify distinct transport regimes characterized by the dynamical exponent $z$: (i) ballistic transport with $z=1$, (ii) superdiffusive transport with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent $z=3/2$, and (iii) diffusive transport with the Edwards-Wilkinson exponent $z=2$. Notably, breaking integrability always drives the system into the diffusive regime. Our results demonstrate that Family-Vicsek scaling extends beyond classical systems, holding universally across quantum many-body models with $SU(N)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the first experimental observation of the long-lived prethermal phases with tunable heating rates in many-body systems, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by the $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and the subsystem entanglement entropy, we trace out the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and confirm the existence of the prethermal plateau. Its lifetime grows algebraically with the driving frequency and the scaling exponent is approximately $2n{+}1$, tunable by the multipolar order. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from the area-law to the volume-law entanglement scaling. We utilize all 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, and their entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work underscores superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.</description>

Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Critical Systems: Revisiting Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Effects of Disorder in a Single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet: A Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo simulation to study the effects of random disorder on equilibrium phase transition of three-dimensional single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The disorder is incorporated in two ways; having a randomly distributed anisotropy and presence of a quenched random field. The ferro-para transition temperature has been found to increase with the increase of the strength of constant (over the space) anisotropy. In contrast, the system gets ordered at lower temperatures if the anisotropy has random distribution. The effects of quenched random fields are also studied in single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The transition temperature reduces due to the presence of quenched random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) linearly depends on the strength of constant single-site anisotropy. We compute the magnetic and susceptibility exponent ratios for constant single-site anisotropic XY system only via detailed finite-size scaling analysis.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of the order parameter of the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model at criticality using the functional renormalisation group. For this purpose, we generalize the method introduced in [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)] to the $O(N)$ model. We study the large $N$ limit, as well as the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$ at the level of the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), and compare our results to Monte Carlo simulations. We compute the entire family of universal scaling functions, obtained in the limit where the system size $L$ and the correlation length of the infinite system $\xi_\infty$ diverge, with the ratio $\zeta=L/\xi_\infty$ constant. We also generalize our results to the approach of criticality from the low-temperature phase where another infinite family of universal PDF exists. We find that the LPA describes very well the functional form of the family of PDFs, once we correct for a global amplitude of the (logarithm of the) PDF and of $\zeta$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</description>

Abstract: Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once: a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>

Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>
