      <title>Bacterial Gene Regulatory Neural Network as a Biocomputing Library of Mathematical Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current biocomputing approaches predominantly rely on engineered circuits with fixed logic, offering limited stability and reliability under diverse environmental conditions. Here, we use the GRNN framework introduced in our previous work to transform bacterial gene expression dynamics into a biocomputing library of mathematical solvers. We introduce a sub-GRNN search algorithm that identifies functional subnetworks tailored to specific mathematical calculation and classification tasks by evaluating gene expression patterns across chemically encoded input conditions. Tasks include identifying Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, multiplication, and Collatz step counts. The identified problem-specific sub-GRNNs are then assessed using gene-wise and collective perturbation, as well as Lyapunov-based stability analysis, to evaluate robustness and reliability. Our results demonstrate that native transcriptional machinery can be harnessed to perform diverse mathematical calculation and classification tasks, while maintaining computing stability and reliability.</description>

      <title>QMill: Representative Quantum Data Generation for Quantum Machine Learning Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises significant speedups, particularly when operating on quantum datasets. However, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of suitable training data. Existing synthetic data generation methods fall short in capturing essential entanglement properties, limiting their utility for QML. To address this, we introduce QMill, a low-depth quantum data generation framework that produces entangled, high-quality samples emulating diverse classical and quantum distributions, enabling more effective development and evaluation of QML models in representative-data settings.</description>

      <title>Polymer-based probabilistic bits for thermodynamic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Bridging Technical Capability and User Accessibility: Off-grid Civilian Emergency Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During large-scale crises disrupting cellular and Internet infrastructure, civilians lack reliable methods for communication, aid coordination, and access to trustworthy information. This paper presents a unified emergency communication system integrating a low-power, long-range network with a crisis-oriented smartphone application, enabling decentralized and off-grid civilian communication. Unlike previous solutions separating physical layer resilience from user layer usability, our design merges these aspects into a cohesive crisis-tailored framework.
  The system is evaluated in two dimensions: communication performance and application functionality. Field experiments in urban Z\"urich demonstrate that the 868 MHz band, using the LongFast configuration, achieves a communication range of up to 1.2 km with 92% Packet Delivery Ratio, validating network robustness under real-world infrastructure degraded conditions. In parallel, a purpose-built mobile application featuring peer-to-peer messaging, identity verification, and community moderation was evaluated through a requirements-based analysis.</description>

      <title>Solving Currency Arbitrage Problems using D-Wave Advantage2 Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently, making use of the principles of quantum mechanics. Companies are increasingly investing in the market of quantum computers, providing the users with the possibility to solve these optimization problems by resorting to quantum computers. This paper explores how Quantum Annealing can be applied to the Currency Arbitrage (CA) optimization problem and its comparative performance against classical methods. A key contribution of the work is an original formulation of the CA problem as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Boolean Optimization) problem. We test the speed of D-wave quantum annealer, using the recently released latest version (Advantage 2).</description>

      <title>TRMAC: A Time-Reversal-based MAC Protocol for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in high-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium Access Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense traffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel cross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time Reversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency channel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless channels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate access using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal resource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer simulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols, achieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds of cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where spatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC can be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with a similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting the need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction for MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel physics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer Fingerprinting using Error Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing matures and moves toward broader accessibility through cloud-based platforms, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of quantum computations becomes an urgent concern. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage the byproducts of quantum error correction (QEC) to verify hardware identity and authenticate quantum computations for "free", without introducing any additional quantum computations or measurements. By treating syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99% accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends. Overall, we re-purpose the intrinsic overhead of error correction to be a mechanism for securing quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Automated Facility Enumeration for Building Compliance Checking using Door Detection and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.</description>
