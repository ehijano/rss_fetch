      <title>Higher-form anomalies and state-operator correspondence beyond conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a state-operator correspondence for a class of non-conformal quantum field theories with continuous higher-form symmetries and a mixed anomaly. Such systems can always be realised as a relativistic superfluid. The symmetry structure induces an infinite tower of conserved charges, which we construct explicitly. These charges satisfy an abelian current algebra with a central extension, generalising the familiar Kac-Moody algebras to higher dimensions. States and operators are organised into representations of this algebra, enabling a direct correspondence. We demonstrate the correspondence explicitly in free examples by performing the Euclidean path integral on a $d$-dimensional ball, with local operators inserted in the origin, and matching to energy eigenstates on $S^{d-1}$ obtained by canonical quantisation. Interestingly, in the absence of conformal invariance, the empty path integral prepares a squeezed vacuum rather than the true ground state.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal dynamics away from the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are usually studied by zooming into the throat that describes their near-horizon geometry. Within this throat, one can argue that two-dimensional JT gravity is the appropriate effective theory that dominates at low temperature. Here, we discuss how to capture this effective description by standing far away from the horizon. Our strategy is to construct a phase space within gravitational theories in AdS$_{d+1}$ that fixes the radial dependence while keeping the transverse dependence arbitrary. This allows us to implement a decoupling limit directly on the phase space while keeping the coordinates fixed. With this, we can relate the effective description in JT gravity to the CFT$_d$ description at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$, which we do explicitly in AdS$_3$ and non-rotating configurations in AdS$_4$. From the perspective of the dual CFT, our decoupling limit should be understood as a flow between a CFT$_{d}$ and a near-CFT$_1$. Our analysis shows that local counterterms can be constructed in the near-CFT$_1$, which arise from the anomalies (or absence of them) in the CFT$_{d}$. We show that one of these counterterms is the Schwarzian effective action, making this sector a scheme-dependent choice. This illustrates the delicate interplay between a far and a near analysis of near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Gauging Non-Invertible Symmetries in (2+1)d Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present practical and formal methods for gauging non-invertible symmetries in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of invertible 0-form gauging, including symmetry fractionalization, discrete torsion, and the fixed point theorem for symmetry action on lines. Our approach involves two complementary strands: the fusion of topological interfaces and Morita theory of fusion 2-categories. We use these methods to derive constraints on gaugeable symmetries and their duals while unifying the prescription for gauging non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries and various higher structures. With a view toward recent advances in creating non-Abelian topological orders from Abelian ones, we give a simple recipe for non-invertible 0-form gauging that takes large classes of the latter to the former. We also describe conditions under which iterated gauging of invertible 0-form symmetries is equivalent to a single-step gauging of a non-invertible symmetry. We conclude with a set of concrete examples illustrating these various phenomena involving gauging symmetries of the infrared limit of the toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in the background of the Einstein universe. We determine numerically the structure of the UV-divergent terms. We study analytically the IR term that originates in the long-range correlations arising from the field zero mode on the sphere. We compare with previous results for a scalar field in a dS or AdS background.</description>

      <title>From Symmetry to Structure: Gauge-Invariant Operators in Multi-Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the algebraic structure of gauge-invariant operators in multi-matrix quantum mechanics has been clarified: this space forms a module over a freely generated ring. The ring is generated by a set of primary invariants, while the module structure is determined by a finite set of secondary invariants. In this work, we show that the number of primary invariants can be computed by performing a complete gauge fixing, which identifies the number of independent physical degrees of freedom. We then compare this result to a complementary counting based on the restricted Schur polynomial basis. This comparison allows us to argue that the number of secondary invariants must exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{cN^2}$ at large $N$, with $c$ a constant.</description>

      <title>Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor correlators in $\phi^4$ theory II: The spin-two sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the computation of the C_T charge of the 2-point function of the Energy-Momentum Tensor to 4-loops. We show that C_T decomposes into two sectors, the conformal sector, which encodes the value of the central charge at fixed points and an RG-sector that contains logarithmic and constant corrections proportional to the beta-function. This latter constitutes the main new result of this work and is inaccessible via CFT methods alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C_T satisfies an eigenvalue-like equation analogous to that of the spin-0 charge, as discussed in part I, though with a different in general eigenvalue. Finally we present three possible applications.</description>

      <title>More on phase transitions in ${\cal N}$ = 2 massive gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large $N$ phase transitions in $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with gauge group $SU(N)$ and massive hypermultiplets in diverse representations. Using supersymmetric localization we identify cases where phase transitions occur. In particular, we consider deformations of UV superconformal fixed points by giving two different masses to the fundamental hypermultiplets, and show that these theories undergo a third-order phase transition at a critical value of the 't Hooft coupling. We also comment on integrated correlators in these theories.</description>

      <title>Infinite Dimensional Topological-Holomorphic Symmetry in Three-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a class of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series which is conjectured in our previous paper [Alkalaev &amp; Mandrygin 2025] to calculate multipoint one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Our approach is based on a simple diagrammatic algorithm which systematically builds both arguments and series coefficients in terms of a convex polygon which is part of the Baxter lattice. The examples of the box, pentagon, and hexagon integrals are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization for Signal Detection: Dimensional Analysis and Dimensional Phase Transition for Nearly Continuous Spectra Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.</description>

      <title>Interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the presence of radiation and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of radiation in the interacting barrow holographic dark energy model for a non-flat universe. For both open and closed universes, we have obtained the evolution equation for the density parameters for dark energy, dark matter and radiation for a specific kind of interaction among the seven possible linear interactions; the analysis with the remaining six interactions will be updated soon in this manuscript. We have then numerically solved those coupled differential equations to show their behaviour with the redshift parameter. We have also found different epochs corresponding to dark energy-dark matter, dark energy-radiation and dark matter-radiation crossings. We have also obtained various observational constraints for our interacting Barrow holographic dark matter model using the Cosmic chronometer data and BAO data. In the upcoming version of the manuscript, we will add the observational constraints of our model using Pantheon data, also several calculations of other interaction scenarios will be added.</description>

      <title>Impact of a complex scalar spectator field on baryon asymmetry within spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the framework of spontaneous baryogenesis by investigating the generation of baryon asymmetry when the inflaton, $\theta$, is minimally coupled with a complex spectator scalar field $\phi$, as $\theta^2|\phi|^2$. To do so, we also consider $\phi$ non-minimally coupled with the Ricci scalar curvature $R$ through a Yukawa-like interaction. We do not consider further interactions of the spectator field with the fermions of the Standard Model, considering it \emph{de facto} as a dark scalar field. In evaluating the violation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical approach, where $\theta$, $\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical fields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion for the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in perturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe. Afterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary dynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays into fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes. We therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous baryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly, the effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when the coupling between $\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is studied in the framework of the exact (functional) renormalization group (ERG). This is done using an approach to these equations which employs dimensional regularization. Simultaneous solutions of the ERG equations and Ward identities are considered. An approach to the study of bound states at long distances in the ERG is employed to describe the positronium. This is done by introducing a real scalar field which describes that bound state. The flow equations are studied using an effective action ansatz and a low-momentum expansion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the corollary Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Crossed Product, Modular (Tomita) Dynamics and its Role in the Transition of Type $III$ to Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and Connections to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the role of the crossed product and the modular (Tomita) dynamics in the transition of type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras which was recently observed in papers by Witten et al. In a preceding paper we argued that type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras display certain features which we attributed to quantum gravity effects. We claim that the action of the modular evolution on the quantum fluctuations can be understood as an aspect of quantum gravity. We mention in this context the work of Sakharov on induced gravity. Furthermore we analyse the change of the properties of projectors and partial isometries in the transition from type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for gluon saturation effects in momentum transfer dependence of coherent charmonium electroproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Phases of Tree-decorated Dynamical Triangulations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to triple-tree phase transition is continuous.</description>

      <title>Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion (ACYT) 6-manifold with co-closed Lee form the curvature of the torsion connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. The same conclusion holds for any (non necessarily compact) balanced ACYT 6-manifold. In particular, on a CYT 6-manifold the Strominger-Bismut connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the Strominger-Bismut connection provided either the CYT 6-manifold is compact with co-closed Lee form or it is a balanced CYT 6-manifold.</description>

      <title>Adjoints of Polytopes: Determinantal Representations and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study determinantal representations of adjoint hypersurfaces of polytopes. We prove that adjoint polynomials of all polygons can be represented as determinants of tridiagonal symmetric matrices of linear forms with the matrix size being equal to the degree of the adjoint. We prove a sufficient combinatorial condition for a surface in the projective three-space to have a determinantal representation and use it to show that adjoints of all three-dimensional polytopes with at most eight facets and a simple facet hyperplane arrangement admit a determinantal representation. This includes all such polytopes with a smooth adjoint. We demonstrate that, starting from four dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces may not admit linear determinantal representations. Along the way we prove that, starting from three dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces are typically singular, in contrast to the two-dimensional case. We also consider a special case of interest to physics, the ABHY associahedron. We construct a determinantal representation of its universal adjoint in three dimensions and show that in higher dimensions a similarly structured representation does not exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Pad\'e approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</description>

      <title>$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearities in Kerr Black Hole Ringdown from the Penrose Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have constructed a generative artificial intelligence model to predict dual gravity solutions when provided with the input of holographic entanglement entropy. The model utilized in our study is based on the transformer algorithm, widely used for various natural language tasks including text generation, summarization, and translation. This algorithm possesses the ability to understand the meanings of input and output sequences by utilizing multi-head attention layers. In the training procedure, we generated pairs of examples consisting of holographic entanglement entropy data and their corresponding metric solutions. Once the model has completed the training process, it demonstrates the ability to generate predictions regarding a dual geometry that corresponds to the given holographic entanglement entropy. Subsequently, we proceed to validate the dual geometry to confirm its correspondence with the holographic entanglement entropy data.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

Abstract: The island paradigm for an AdS$_2$ eternal black hole in the Hartle-Hawking state coupled to a finite temperature non-gravitating bath asserts that after the Page time the operators in the black hole interior can be reconstructed using the bath degrees of freedom. We demonstrate this assertion by consideing a special operator $\mathbb{U}_{bath}$ that has nontrivial action only on the bath degrees of freedom. We show via the gravitational Euclidean path integral analysis that though before the Page time $\mathbb{U}_{bath}$ does not translate the operators in the bath to the black hole interior, after the Page time it takes them to the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Fermionic back-reaction on kink and topological charge pumping in the $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Faddeev-Jackiw (F-J) symplectic Hamiltonian reduction of the $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM), which includes new parametrizations for a scalar field and a Grassmannian fermionic field. The structure of constraints and symplectic potentials primarily dictates the strong-weak dual coupling sectors of the theory, ensuring the equivalence between the Noether and topological currents. The analytical calculations encompass the fermion-kink classical solution, the excited fermion bound states localized on the kink, and the scattering states, all of which account for the fermion back-reaction on the soliton. The total energy, which includes the classical fermion-soliton interaction energy, the bound-state fermion energy, and the fermion vacuum polarization energy (VPE), is determined by the topological charge of the kink. This system satisfies first-order differential equations and a chiral current conservation equation. Our results demonstrate that the excited fermion bound states and scattering states significantly alter the properties of the kink. Notably, they give rise to a pumping mechanism for the topological charge of the in-gap kink due to fermionic back-reaction, as well as the appearance of kink states in the continuum (KIC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative production of scalar particles within the Higgs-$R^2$ inflation model, focusing on a massive spectator field that interacts gravitationally via a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar $R$. By transforming the model to the Einstein frame, where direct couplings between inflationary dynamics and the spectator field emerge, we analyze both perturbative and non-perturbative particle production. We solve the spectator field equation numerically, using the Bogolyubov transformation, to calculate the comoving particle density. Our findings indicate that particle production occurs for light particles with conformal coupling and for masses $m_\chi &gt; M/2$ in the minimally coupled scenario.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Foam Effects on Charged AdS Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the emergent thermodynamic phenomena arising from spacetime foam and its impact on black hole behavior. Within this framework, we adopt the Barrow model, where the structure of spacetime at small scales is modeled by analogy with the Koch snowflake, implying that black hole surfaces acquire a quasi-fractal structure due to quantum deformations induced by quantum gravity effects. Our analysis, conducted within the extended phase-space formalism, reveals that the quasi-fractal correction to black hole entropy significantly modifies the equation of state, critical parameters, and phase-transition behavior of charged AdS black holes. An increase in the Barrow parameter leads to higher critical pressure and temperature, which diverge at maximal deformation. Moreover, while the quasi-fractal structure has a negligible effect on small black holes with low entropy, it clearly influences the thermal evolution of medium and large event horizon black holes. Additionally, we study the impact of quasi-fractal corrections on the Joule-Thomson expansion and the phase transition between cooling and heating regimes. We also examine the effects of spacetime structure on black hole microstate density, lifetimes, and temperature detection by different observers, including local, asymptotic, and Unruh detectors. We find that spacetime foam increases microstate density and prolongs evaporation lifetimes, thus acting as a resistance to black hole evaporation, while local observers experience that the expected Tolman blueshift and Unruh temperatures remain unmodified.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2109.00065, it was pointed out that superstring theory on $AdS_3$ with $(NS,NS)$ $B$-field background and $R_{AdS}/l_s=\sqrt k&lt;1$ is dual to a symmetric product CFT deformed by an operator in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted sector. We generalize the analysis of arXiv:2109.00065 to $k&gt;1$, and show that the resulting picture matches that discussed in the bosonic case in arXiv:2110.07535. We argue that in the critical case, $k=1$ hep-th/0503121, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted deformation remains non-trivial. This resolves some confusions in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We determine the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra which is an extension of ${\cal N}=4$ $SO(4)$ superconformal algebra with vanishing central charge. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitinos, the vectors, the Majorana fermions, the scalar or the pseudoscalar, from the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra, in two dimensions with the ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity theory with $SO(4)$ global symmetry in four dimensions found by Das (at Stony Brook in 1977), via celestial holography. Furthermore, the truncations of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric soft current algebra provide the soft current algebras for the ${\cal N}=2,3$ supergravity theories, the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to its Abelian vector multiplet and the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Maxwell Einstein theory. For the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity theory, the soft current algebra can be also realized from the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{K,K}[\lambda=0]$ algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) background in energy regularization of global structures in $(2, 1)$--dimensions. To this end, we consider a model in which the complex scalar and fixed three-vector couple as a high derivative order term. We show that LIV-background does not affect the energy and the equation of motion of neutral global structures. However, we observe that the charged structures are sensitive to LIV-background by presenting signatures in the electric field whose intensity is controlled by the LIV-parameter. Furthermore, the procedure developed leads to first-order solutions with finite energy and a regularized electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relationality is the paradigmatic conceptual core of general-relativistic gauge field theory. It can be made manifest via the Dressing Field Method (DFM) of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to achieve gauge-invariance by extracting the physical degrees of freedom representing relations among field variables. We review and further expand on some applications of the DFM to the very foundations of the supersymmetric framework, where it allows to build relational supersymmetric field theory and (dis)solves crucial issues. Furthermore, we elaborate on a novel approach within the relational supersymmetric field theory framework giving a unified description of fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields, and thus close to Berezin's original motivation for the introduction of supergeometry in fundamental physics: a Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Unification (MISU). This new approach stands irrespective from the ultimate empirical status of standard supersymmetric field theory, about which it is agnostic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is ample evidence that the bulk dual of a $T\overline{T}$ deformed holographic CFT is a gravitational system with a finite area cutoff boundary. For states dual to black holes, the finite cutoff surface cannot be moved beyond the event horizon. We overcome this by considering an extension of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation with a boundary cosmological constant and a prescription for a sequence of flows that successfully pushes the cutoff boundary past the event horizon and arbitrarily close to the black hole singularity. We show how this sequence avoids the complexification of the deformed boundary energies. The approach to the singularity is reflected on the boundary by the approach of the deformed energies to an accumulation point in the limit of arbitrarily large distance in deformation space. We argue that this sequence of flows is automatically implemented by the gravitational path integral given only the values of the initial ADM charges and the area of the finite cutoff surface, suggesting a similar automatic boundary mechanism that keeps all the deformed energies real at arbitrary values of the deformation parameter. This leads to a natural definition of a deformed boundary canonical ensemble partition function that sums over the entire spectrum and remains real for any value of the deformation parameter. We find that this partition function displays Hagedorn growth at the scale set by the deformation parameter, which we associate to the region near the inner horizon in the bulk dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics using geometric phases and the adiabatic approximation in quantum field theory. In this framework, the asymptotic \textit{in} and \textit{out} states are modified by Berry phases, $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{in}}}$ and $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{out}}}$, which encode the infrared structure non-perturbatively and regulate soft-photon divergences.
  Unlike the Faddeev--Kulish formalism, which employs perturbative dressing with coherent states, our approach reformulates the effective action in terms of Berry connections in field space. This yields finite, gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes without requiring a sum over soft-photon emissions.
  We show that infrared divergences cancel to all orders in the bremsstrahlung vertex function $\Gamma^\mu(p_1, p_2)$, due to destructive interference among inequivalent Berry phases. As an application, we study the formation of positronium in the infrared regime and argue that the dressed \(S\)-matrix exhibits a functional singularity at $s = 4 m_e^2$, corresponding to a physical pole generated by topological flux.</description>

      <title>From chords and complexity to dynamical wormholes with matter: Towards a bulk double-scaled (SYK) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a bulk description of the double-scaled algebra of the DSSYK model \cite{Lin:2022rbf}. Based on the Hartle-Hawking (HH) state with matter operators, we derive several properties of the DSSYK model, without making assumptions about the specific dual theory, including its semiclassical thermodynamics, correlation functions, and Krylov complexity. These quantities are found from the saddle points of the DSSYK path integral preparing the HH state. We also construct a Lanczos algorithm that simultaneously evaluates Krylov state and operator complexity in the two-sided Hamiltonian system including finite temperature effects. In the semiclassical limit, both measures are encoded in the saddle points of the path integral. They have a bulk interpretation in terms of minimal geodesic lengths in an effective AdS$_2$ space with matter backreaction. Different saddle points correspond to geodesic distances with different evolution, and they display different scrambling properties. This allows us to quantize the bulk theory dual to the DSSYK model. At last, we deduce the boundary/bulk dictionary of the double-scaled algebra, and the dual entry of the proper radial momentum of a bulk probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the scenario that the observable universe emerged from the vicinity of a negative mass ring singularity, and all content of the universe travels at the same group velocity close to the speed of light on a geodesic trajectory along the axis of rotation of the singularity. In appropriate coordinate parametrization and evaluated on the trajectory, we find that the metric tensor in the vicinity of the trajectory exhibits a conformal scale factor $a(\eta)$ with contraction and subsequent expansion properties that solve the horizon problem. We then introduce a static flow of gravitating radiation along the trajectory (perturbatively with respect to the mass scale of the singularity) to model a homogeneous radiation dominated universe. Solving the Einstein field equations with a physically motivated ansatz of metric perturbation then reveals that the effective conformal scale factor indeed grows asymptotically with the same power law as expected in a conventional radiation dominated universe.</description>

      <title>The fermionic double smeared null energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy conditions are crucial for understanding why exotic phenomena such as traversable wormholes and closed timelike curves remain elusive. In this paper, we prove the Double Smeared Null Energy Condition (DSNEC) for the fermionic free theory in 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time, extending previous work on the same energy condition for the bosonic case [1][2] by adapting Fewster and Mistry's method [3] to the energy-momentum tensor $T_{++}$. A notable difference from previous works lies in the presence of the $\gamma_0 \gamma_+$ matrix in $T_{++}$, causing a loss of symmetry. This challenge is addressed by making use of its square-root matrix. We provide explicit analytic results for the massless case as well as numerical insights for the mass-dependence of the bound in the case of Gaussian smearing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell inequality violation in vector diboson systems produced in decays of spin-0 particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss entanglement and the violation of the CGLMP inequality in a system of two vector bosons produced in the decay of a spin-0 particle. We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <title>Merging black holes with Cauchy-characteristic matching: Computation of late-time tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM) is a numerical-relativity technique that solves Einstein's equations on an effectively infinite computational domain, thereby eliminating systematic errors associated with artificial boundary conditions. Whether CCM can robustly handle fully nonlinear, dynamical spacetimes, such as binary black hole (BBH) mergers, has remained an open question. In this work, we provide a positive answer by presenting nine successful CCM simulations of BBHs; and demonstrate a key application of this method: computing late-time tails. Our results pave the path for systematic studies of late-time tails in BBH systems, and for producing highly accurate waveforms essential to next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance breaking has been investigated in the literature in several contexts, including emergent General Relativity (GR). If GR emerges from an underlying theory without diffeomorphism invariance, there may be small violations of this symmetry at low energies. Since such small violations should not cause instabilities in cosmological evolution, it is a suitable framework for examining such symmetry-breaking effects. In this paper, the cosmological evolution with broken diffeomorphism invariance is investigated in the (modified) FLRW spacetime in the effective theory framework. The GR Lagrangian is augmented with all diffeomorphism-breaking but Lorentz-invariant terms in the leading order, namely, those involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the conditions for a healthy linearized theory. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since an analytic solution does not exist in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no signs of unhealthy behavior are observed: minor diffeomorphism-violating modifications to GR at the level of two derivatives do not cause instabilities in the basic cosmological evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on work using a newly developed code, SpheriCo.jl, that computes the gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field, where the scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. By utilising summation-by-parts methods for the numerical derivatives we are able to simulate the collapse longer than was possible previously due to enhanced numerical stability. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability, both for the classical and quantum fields. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole. We lift this construction to the dynamical cosmological event horizon of an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term in the formula for the entropy, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's "first law of event horizons" to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles with multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be copiously produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers through nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung if the ALP-nucleon couplings $g_{a N}$ are sizable. The ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ may trigger conversions of ultralight ALPs into photons in the magnetic fields of the merger remnant and of the Milky Way. This effect would lead to a potentially observable short gamma-ray signal, in coincidence with the gravitational-wave signal produced during the merging process. This event could be detected through multi-messenger observation of BNS mergers employing the synergy between gravitational-wave detectors and gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we study the sensitivity of current and proposed MeV gamma-ray experiments to detect such a signal. As an explicit example, we consider ALP couplings related as in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) axion model, and show that in this case the proposed instruments can reach a sensitivity down to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim \textrm{few} \times 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV, comparable with the SN 1987A limit.</description>

Abstract: We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density profile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter choices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark matter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. For a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of state works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic completeness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study the shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with available observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the defect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>

Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>
