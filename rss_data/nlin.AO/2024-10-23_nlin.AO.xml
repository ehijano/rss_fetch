Abstract: In addition to a common synchronization and/or localization behavior, a system of linearly coupled identical bistable Van der Pol (BVdP) oscillators can exhibit a "non-conventional" or "modal" synchronization. In two-DOF case, one can observe stable beatings attractor with synchronized amplitudes of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. Current study demonstrates that this unusual behavior is generic and quite ubiquitous, if the system is explored in appropriate parametric regime. Indeed, in the absence of the self - excitation the system of coupled linear oscillators possesses a complete set of non-interacting eigenmodes. If the system is symmetric and the coupling is weak enough, appropriate initial conditions will result in a continuous multi-parametric family of stationary beatings or beat waves. If the self-excitation terms are small enough, i.e. even weaker than the weak coupling, one can expect that, generically, some special stationary or wave beatings will turn into the stable attractors. We demonstrate this phenomenon in systems of ring-coupled BVdP oscillators. In particular, we observe simple two-wave synchronization for $N=2,3,5,6,7$ coupled oscillators; for $N=2$ it corresponds to the "modal" synchronization observed previously. The case $N=4$ is special: due to internal resonances in the slow flow, the two-wave synchronization turns unstable, and more complicated patterns of the multi-wave synchronization are revealed. Analytic models manage to capture the shapes of the observed beat waves. All results are verified by direct numeric simulations.</description>
