      <title>Carleman approximation on Riemann surfaces without critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the class of semi-admissible subsets of an open Riemann surface on which Carleman approximation by non-critical holomorphic functions is possible. In particular we characterize closed sets with empty interior on which continuous functions can be approximated by non-critical holomorphic ones. We also consider a different approach, which in some cases gives uniform approximation by non-critical holomorphic functions on more general sets than semi-admissible ones.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of holomorphic maps between bounded symmetric domains preserving Shilov boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of orthogonal structure on complex Grassmannians. Based on this structure, we define the notion of orthogonal mappings. This class of maps generalizes holomorphic maps between type I bounded symmetric domains that preserve Shilov boundary. By analyzing the geometric properties of these orthogonal mappings, we obtain rigidity results for such mappings. As an application, we establish a rigidity result for holomorphic maps from rank $1$ type I bounded symmetric domains $\Omega_{1,s}$ (complex balls $B^s$) to higher-rank domains $
  \Omega_{r',s'}$ that preserve their corresponding Shilov boundaries, where $s\ge 2$ and $2\le r'\le s'$. More specifically, we show that (1): such maps are constant when $s'-r' &lt; s-1$; (2) for $s-1 \le s'-r' &lt; 2s-2$, these maps reduce to standard linear embeddings after normalization by applying automorphisms on both sides. Our results are optimal and generalize the well-known optimal bounds for proper mappings between rank $1$ cases and CR maps between Shilov boundaries of higher-rank type I bounded symmetric domains.</description>

      <title>On the spectral theory in the Fock space with polynomial eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of the eigenvalue problem in the Fock space with polynomial eigenfunctions is introduced. This problem is classified by using the finite-dimensional representations of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-algebra in Fock space. In the complex representation of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra, proposed by Turbiner-Vasilevski (2021) in Ref.7, this construction is reduced to the linear differential operators in $(\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}}\,,\,\frac{\partial}{\partial z})$ acting on the space of poly-analytic functions in $(z,\overline{z})$. The number operator, equivalently, the Euler-Cartan operator appears as fundamental, it is studied in detail. The notion of (quasi)-exactly solvable operators is introduced. The particular examples of the Hermite and Laguerre operators in Fock space are proposed as well as the Heun, Lame and sextic QES polynomial operators.</description>

      <title>Whitney Approximation: domains and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of holomorphic extensions in the one-variable case of Whitney's Approximation Theorem on intervals. Improving a result of Gauthier-Kienzle, we construct tangentially approximating functions which extend holomorphically to domains of optimal size. For approximands on unbounded closed intervals, we also bound the growth of holomorphic extensions, in the spirit of Arakelyan, Bernstein, Keldych, and Kober.</description>

      <title>Intersection of holonomy varieties of $CP^1$-structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a closed orientable surface of genus at least two, and let $X, Y$ be distinct marked Riemann surface structures on $\Sigma$, possibly with opposite orientations.
  In this paper, we show that there are (exactly) countably infinite pairs of ${\rm CP}^1$-structures on $X$ and on $Y$ sharing holonomy $\pi_1(\Sigma) \to {\rm PSL}_2 {\rm C}$.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>
