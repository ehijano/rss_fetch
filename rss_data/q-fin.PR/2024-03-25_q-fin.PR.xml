      <title>Crypto Inverse-Power Options and Fractional Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has highlighted the crucial role of jumps in both price and volatility within the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model framework featuring fractional stochastic volatility, accommodating price--volatility co-jumps and volatility short-term dependency concurrently. We particularly focus on inverse options, including the emerging Quanto inverse options and their power-type generalizations, aimed at mitigating cryptocurrency exchange rate risk and adjusting inherent risk exposure. Characteristic function-based pricing--hedging formulas are derived for these inverse options. The general model framework is then applied to asymmetric Laplace jump-diffusions and Gaussian-mixed tempered stable-type processes, employing three types of fractional kernels, for an extensive empirical analysis involving model calibration on two independent Bitcoin options data sets, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Key insights from our theoretical analysis and empirical findings include: (1) the superior performance of fractional stochastic-volatility models compared to various benchmark models, including those incorporating jumps and stochastic volatility, (2) the practical necessity of jumps in both price and volatility, along with their co-jumps and rough volatility, in the cryptocurrency market, (3) stability of calibrated parameter values in line with stylized facts, and (4) the suggestion that a piecewise kernel offers much higher computational efficiency relative to the commonly used Riemann--Liouville kernel in constructing fractional models, yet maintaining the same accuracy level, thanks to its potential for obtaining explicit model characteristic functions.</description>

      <title>Anticipatory Gains and Event-Driven Losses in Blockchain-Based Fan Tokens: Evidence from the FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: National football teams increasingly issue tradeable blockchain-based fan tokens to strategically enhance fan engagement. This study investigates the impact of 2022 World Cup matches on the dynamic performance of each team's fan token. The event study uncovers fan token returns surged six months before the World Cup, driven by positive anticipation effects. However, intraday analysis reveals a reversal of fan token returns consistently declining and trading volumes rising as matches unfold. To explain findings, we uncover asymmetries whereby defeats in high-stake matches caused a plunge in fan token returns, compared to low-stake matches, intensifying in magnitude for knockout matches. Contrarily, victories enhance trading volumes, reflecting increased market activity without a corresponding positive effect on returns. We align findings with the classic market adage "buy the rumor, sell the news," unveiling cognitive biases and nuances in investor sentiment, cautioning the dichotomy of pre-event optimism and subsequent performance declines.</description>

      <title>Analytical valuation of vulnerable derivative claims with bilateral cash flows under credit, funding and wrong-way risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of valuing and hedging a vulnerable derivative claim with bilateral cash flows between two counterparties in the presence of asymmetric funding costs, defaults and wrong way risk (WWR). We characterize the pre-default claim value as the solution to a non-linear Cauchy problem. We show an explicit stochastic representation of the solution exists under a funding policy which linearises the Cauchy PDE. We apply this framework to the valuation of a vulnerable equity forward and show it can be represented as a portfolio of European options. Despite the complexity of the model, we prove the forward's value admits an analytical formula involving only elementary functions and Gaussian integrals. Based on this explicit formula, numerical analysis demonstrates WWR has a significant impact even under benign assumptions: with a parameter configuration less punitive than that representative of Archegos AM default, we find WWR can shift values for vulnerable forwards by 100bps of notional, while peak exposures increase by 25% of notional. This framework is the first to apply to contracts with bilateral cash flows in the presence of credit, funding and WWR, resulting in a non-linear valuation formula which admits a closed-form solution under a suitable funding policy.</description>

      <title>Price and Payoff Autocorrelations in a Multi-Period Consumption-Based Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper highlights the hidden dependence of the basic pricing equation of a multi-period consumption-based asset pricing model on price and payoff autocorrelations. We obtain the approximations of the basic pricing equation that describe the mean price "to-day," mean payoff "next-day," price and payoff volatilities, and price and payoff autocorrelations. The deep conjunction of the consumption-based model with other versions of asset pricing, such as ICAPM, APM, etc. (Cochrane, 2001), emphasizes that our results are valid for other pricing models.</description>
