      <title>A proof of generic Green's conjecture in odd genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a new proof of Voisin's theorem on Green's conjecture for generic curves of odd genus resembling the first two sections of "Universal Secant Bundles and Syzygies of Canonical Curves" by the author, and so avoiding the need for difficult computations.</description>

      <title>The period-index problem for hyper-K\"ahler varieties via hyperholomorphic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new bounds for the period-index problem for hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type using projectively hyperholomorphic bundles constructed by Markman. We show that $\mathrm{dim}(X)$ is a bound for any $X$ of $K3^{[n]}$-type. We also show that the bound can be reduced to $\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{dim}(X)$, as conjectured by Huybrechts, when the Picard rank of $X$ is at least 3.</description>

      <title>Strength and partition rank under limits and field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of a multivariate homogeneous polynomial is the minimal number of terms in an expression as a sum of products of lower-degree homogeneous polynomials. Partition rank is the analogue for multilinear forms. Both ranks can drop under field extensions, and both can jump in a limit. We show that, for fixed degree and under mild conditions on the characteristic of the ground field, the strength is at most a polynomial in the border strength. We also establish an analogous result for partition rank. Our results control both the jump under limits and the drop under field extensions.</description>

      <title>The non-Archimedean Green--Griffiths--Lang--Vojta conjecture for commutative algebraic groups with unipotent rank 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, let $G$ be a commutative algebraic group over $k$ such that the linear part of $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{G}_a$, and let $X$ be a closed subvariety of $G$. We show that the Kawamata locus of $X$ is equal to a Lang-like exceptional locus of $X$, and furthermore, we identify a condition on $X$ that implies that these loci are proper subschemes of $X$. We also prove the strong form of the non-Archimedean Green--Griffiths--Lang--Vojta conjecture for closed subvarieties of commutative algebraic groups where the linear part is isomorphic to $\mathbb{G}_a \times \mathbb{G}_m^t$.</description>

      <title>Gluing Genus 1 and Genus 2 Curves Along $\ell$-torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb Q$. We provide a method to systematically search for possible candidates of prime $\ell\geq 3$ and a genus $1$ curve $X$ for which there exists genus $3$ curve $Z$ over $\mathbb Q$ whose Jacobian is up to quadratic twist $(\ell, \ell, \ell)$-isogenous to the product of Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$, building off of the work by Hanselman, Schiavone, and Sijsling for $\ell=2$. We find several such pairs $(X,Y)$ for prime $\ell$ up to $13$. We also improve their numerical gluing algorithm, allowing us to successfully glue genus $1$ and genus $2$ curves along their $13$-torsion.</description>

      <title>A tropical approach to rigidity: counting realisations of frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A realisation of a graph in the plane as a bar-joint framework is rigid if there are finitely many other realisations, up to isometries, with the same edge lengths. Each of these finitely-many realisations can be seen as a solution to a system of quadratic equations prescribing the distances between pairs of points. For generic realisations, the size of the solution set depends only on the underlying graph so long as we allow for complex solutions. We provide a characterisation of the realisation number - that is the cardinality of this complex solution set - of a minimally rigid graph. Our characterisation uses tropical geometry to express the realisation number as an intersection of Bergman fans of the graphic matroid. As a consequence, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the realisation number involving the Tutte polynomial. Moreover, we provide computational evidence that our upper bound is usually an improvement on the mixed volume bound.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Efficiency and Comparison of Different Numerical Differentiation Methods on Three Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without question regarding its pivotal significance, the computation of function derivatives carries substantial weight within a multitude of engineering and applied mathematical fields. These encompass optimization, the development of nonlinear control systems, and the assessment of noisy time signals, among others. In this study, we have chosen three illustrative cases: the logistic model for population dynamics, temperature variation within buildings, and the determination of market equilibrium prices. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of various numerical differentiation techniques and conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes for each of these case studies. To achieve this objective, we employed three distinct numerical differentiation techniques: The Forward, Backward, and Centered FiniteDifference methods, each executed in two different levels of precision, totaling six variations. Our findings clearly indicate that, for the initial case study, the methods characterized by lower computational costs (specifically, the Forward and Backward Finite-Difference methods) yield superior outcomes. In contrast, for the second case study, the Centered Finite-Difference method delivers better results. In the case of the third case study, our results reveal that none of the methods produce estimations that meet acceptable standards. It is noteworthy that the empirical equations for each case study have been validated against previous literature.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Estimation Accuracy of 5 Different Numerical ODE Solvers on 3 Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are indispensable tools in various engineering domains, enabling the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.</description>

      <title>Euclidean distance degree in manifold optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Euclidean distance degrees of the three most common manifolds arising in manifold optimization: flag, Grassmann, and Stiefel manifolds. For the Grassmannian, we will also determine the Euclidean distance degree of an important class of Schubert varieties that often appear in applications. Our technique goes further than furnishing the value of the Euclidean distance degree; it will also yield closed-form expressions for all stationary points of the Euclidean distance function in each instance. We will discuss the implications of these results on the tractability of manifold optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Integral p-adic cohomology theories for open and singular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For open and singular varieties in positive characteristic p we study the existence of an integral p-adic cohomology theory which is finitely generated, compatible with log crystalline cohomology and rationally compatible with rigid cohomology. We develop such a theory under certain assumptions of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, by using cdp- and cdh-topologies.
  Without resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, we prove the existence of a good p-adic cohomology theory for open and singular varieties in cohomological degree 1, by using split proper generically \'etale hypercoverings. This is a slight generalisation of a result due to Andreatta--Barbieri-Viale. We also prove that this approach does not work for higher cohomological degrees.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>
