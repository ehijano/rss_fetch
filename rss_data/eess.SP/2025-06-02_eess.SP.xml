      <title>Unobservable Systems: No Problem for Noise Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the noise identification of a linear time-varying stochastic dynamic system described by the state-space model. In particular, the stress is laid on the design of the correlation measurement difference method for estimation of the state and measurement noise covariance matrices for both observable and \textit{unobservable} systems with possibly unknown input sequence. The method provides unbiased and consistent estimates and is implemented in a publicly available MATLAB toolbox and numerically evaluated.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast High-Flux Single-Photon LiDAR Simulator via Neural Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of photon registrations in single-photon LiDAR (SPL) is essential for applications such as depth estimation under high-flux conditions, where hardware dead time significantly distorts photon measurements. However, the conventional wisdom is computationally intensive due to their inherently sequential, photon-by-photon processing. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework that accelerates the simulation process by modeling the photon count and directly predicting the photon registration probability density function (PDF) using an autoencoder (AE). Our method achieves high accuracy in estimating both the total number of registered photons and their temporal distribution, while substantially reducing simulation time. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential to enable fast and accurate SPL simulations for data-intensive imaging tasks in the high-flux regime.</description>

      <title>Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the proposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we discuss that this improvement primarily stems from the model's structural ability to leverage inter-fault classification task interactions, rather than from a simple increase in model parameters.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection of Correlated Sensor Data: An Integrated Principal Component Analysis-Autoencoder Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of IoT systems in industries like transportation, banking, healthcare, and smart energy has increased reliance on sensor networks. However, anomalies in sensor readings can undermine system reliability, making real-time anomaly detection essential. While a large body of research addresses anomaly detection in IoT networks, few studies focus on correlated sensor data streams, such as temperature and pressure within a shared space, especially in resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid machine learning approach combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders. In this method, PCA continuously monitors sensor data and triggers the Autoencoder when significant variations are detected. This hybrid approach, validated with real-world and simulated data, shows faster response times and fewer false positives. The F1 score of the hybrid method is comparable to Autoencoder, with much faster response time which is driven by PCA.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant IoT System Using Software-Based "Digital Twin"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel redundancy scheme to realize a fault-tolerant IoT structure for application in high-reliability systems. The proposed fault-tolerant structure uses a centralized data fusion block and triplicated IoT devices, along with software-based "digital twins", that duplicate the function of each of the sensors. In case of a fault in one of the IoT devices, the pertinent digital twin takes over the function of the actual IoT device for some time in the triplicated structure till the faulty device is either replaced or repaired when possible. The use of software-based digital twins as a duplicate for each physical sensor improves the reliability of the operation with minimal increase in the overall system cost.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Maps for 6G Wireless Networks: Construction, Applications, and Future Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 6G wireless networks promises unprecedented connectivity, supporting ultra-high data rates, low latency, and massive device connectivity. However, these ambitious goals introduce significant challenges, particularly in channel estimation due to complex and dynamic propagation environments. This paper explores the concept of channel knowledge maps (CKMs) as a solution to these challenges. CKMs enable environment-aware communications by providing location-specific channel information, reducing reliance on real-time pilot measurements. We categorize CKM construction techniques into measurement-based, model-based, and hybrid methods, and examine their key applications in integrated sensing and communication systems, beamforming, trajectory optimization of unmanned aerial vehicles, base station placement, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and propose future research directions to enhance the robustness, accuracy, and scalability of CKM-based systems in the evolving 6G landscape.</description>

      <title>Wideband channel sensing with holographic interference surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Holographic Interference Surface (HIS) opens up a new prospect for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture by performing Radio Frequency (RF) domain signal processing. In this paper, we establish a wideband channel sensing architecture for electromagnetic wave reception and channel estimation based on the principle of holographic interference theory. Dute to the nonlinear structure of holograms, interferential fringes composed of wideband RF signals exhibit severe self-interference effects in the time-frequency domain, which are inherently resistant to the classical signal processing tools. To overcome the self-interference, we propose a holographic channel recovery method, which analyzes the time-domain variation of holograms from a geometrical perspective and constructs an inverse mapping from wideband holograms to object waves. Based on the Wirtinger partial derivative and Armijo condition, we then develop a wideband hologram-based maximum likelihood (WH-ML) estimation method for estimating the channel state information (CSI) from holograms. We also propose a geometric rotation-based object wave sensing (GROWS) algorithm to address the complicated computation of ML estimation. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for investigating the achievable performance of wideband holographic channel estimation. Simulation results show that under the wideband channel sensing architecture, our proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the CSI in wideband scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Receive Beamforming for Tri-directional Coil-Based Magnetic Induction Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we enhance the omnidirectional coverage performance of tri-directional coil-based magnetic induction communication (TC-MIC) and reduce the pathloss with a joint transmit and receive magnetic beamforming method. An iterative optimization algorithm incorporating the transmit current vector and receive weight matrix is developed to minimize the pathloss under constant transmit power constraints. We formulate the mathematical models for the mutual inductance of tri-directional coils, receive power, and pathloss. The optimization problem is decomposed into Rayleigh quotient extremum optimization for transmit currents and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality-constrained optimization for receive weights, with an alternating iterative algorithm to approach the global optimum. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges within an average of 13.6 iterations, achieving up to 54% pathloss reduction compared with equal power allocation schemes. The joint optimization approach exhibits superior angular robustness, maintaining pathloss fluctuation smaller than 2 dB, and reducing fluctuation of pathloss by approximately 45% compared with single-parameter optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Real-time Fall Prevention system for the Next-generation of Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions, something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the safety of workers.</description>

      <title>How can AI reduce fall injuries in the workplace?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fall-caused injuries are common in all types of work environments, including offices. They are the main cause of absences longer than three days, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). However, data, data amount, data heterogeneity, and stringent processing time constraints continue to pose challenges to real-time fall detection. This work proposes a new approach based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) for Fall Detection and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to estimate the time of impact of the fall. The approach is tested on SisFall, a dataset consisting of 2706 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and 1798 falls recorded by three sensors. The results show that the proposed approach achieves an average TPR of 82.6% and TNR of 98.4% for fall sequences and 94.4% in ADL. Besides, the Root Mean Squared Error of the estimated time of impact is approximately 160ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the development of a control and sensor strategy for an industrial wearable wrist exoskeleton by classifying and predicting workers' actions. The study evaluates the correlation between exerted force and effort intensity, along with sensor strategy optimization, for designing purposes. Using data from six healthy subjects in a manufacturing plant, this paper presents EMG-based models for wrist motion classification and force prediction. Wrist motion recognition is achieved through a pattern recognition algorithm developed with surface EMG data from an 8-channel EMG sensor (Myo Armband); while a force regression model uses wrist and hand force measurements from a commercial handheld dynamometer (Vernier GoDirect Hand Dynamometer). This control strategy forms the foundation for a streamlined exoskeleton architecture designed for industrial applications, focusing on simplicity, reduced costs, and minimal sensor use while ensuring reliable and effective assistance.</description>

      <title>Detecting Airborne Objects with 5G NR Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing capabilities into 5G New Radio (5G NR) networks offers an opportunity to enable the detection of airborne objects without the need for dedicated radars. This paper investigates the feasibility of using standardized Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) to detect UAVs in Urban Micro (UMi) and Urban Macro (UMa) propagation environments. A full 5G NR radar processing chain is implemented, including clutter suppression, angle and range estimation, and 3D position reconstruction. Simulation results show that performance strongly depends on the propagation environment. 5G NR radars exhibit the highest missed detection rate, up to 16%, in UMi, due to severe clutter. Positioning error increases with target distance, resulting in larger errors in UMa scenarios and at higher UAV altitudes. In particular, the system achieves a position error within 4m in the UMi environment and within 8m in UMa. The simulation platform has been released as open-source software to support reproducible research in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Beamforming for RIS-Empowered ISAC Systems over Secure Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand innovative solutions to balance spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. In this paper, we propose a coordinated beamforming framework for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered ISAC system, where the active precoding at the dual-functional base station (DFBS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly optimized to provide communication services for legitimate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while sensing the unauthorized UAVs. The sum-rate of all legitimate UAVs are maximized, while satisfying the radar sensing signal-to-noise ratio requirements, the transmit power constraints, and the reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the inherent non-convexity from coupled variables, we propose a low-complexity algorithm integrating fractional programming with alternating optimization, featuring convergence guarantees. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher data rate compared to disjoint optimization benchmarks. This underscores RIS's pivotal role in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities for low-altitude networks.</description>

      <title>QuantX: A Framework for Hardware-Aware Quantization of Generative AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present QuantX: a tailored suite of recipes for LLM and VLM quantization. It is capable of quantizing down to 3-bit resolutions with minimal loss in performance. The quantization strategies in QuantX take into account hardware-specific constraints to achieve efficient dequantization during inference ensuring flexible trade-off between runtime speed, memory requirement and model accuracy. Our results demonstrate that QuantX achieves performance within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized down to 3-bits for multiple end user tasks and outperforms recently published state-of-the-art quantization techniques. This manuscript provides insights into the LLM quantization process that motivated the range of recipes and options that are incorporated in QuantX.</description>

      <title>B2LoRa: Boosting LoRa Transmission for Satellite-IoT Systems with Blind Coherent Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, satellite-IoT systems using the LoRa technique have been increasingly deployed to provide widespread Internet services to low-power and low-cost ground devices. However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time, frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems, respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic Receivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (C&amp;S). Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking an interpretable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing challenges in its practical C&amp;S applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals that a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band C&amp;S performance. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Waveguide Pinching Antennas for ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel flexible-antenna technology, called pinching antennas, has attracted growing academic interest. By inserting discrete dielectric materials, pinching antennas can be activated at arbitrary points along waveguides, allowing for flexible customization of large-scale path loss. This paper investigates a multi-waveguide pinching-antenna integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, where transmit pinching antennas (TPAs) and receive pinching antennas (RPAs) coordinate to simultaneously detect one potential target and serve one downlink user. We formulate a communication rate maximization problem subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement, transmit power budget, and the allowable movement region of the TPAs, by jointly optimizing TPA locations and transmit beamforming design. To address the non-convexity of the problem, we propose a novel fine-tuning approximation method to reformulate it into a tractable form, followed by a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to obtain the solution efficiently. Extensive simulations validate both the system design and the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance compared with the computational-intensive exhaustive search-based benchmark, and pinching-antenna ISAC systems exhibit a distinct communication-sensing trade-off compared with conventional systems.</description>

      <title>When Humans Growl and Birds Speak: High-Fidelity Voice Conversion from Human to Animal and Designed Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS, achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres.

      <title>MagicGripper: A Multimodal Sensor-Integrated Gripper for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation in unstructured environments demands precise, multimodal perception to enable robust and adaptive control. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) have emerged as an effective solution; however, conventional VBTSs often face challenges in achieving compact, multi-modal functionality due to hardware constraints and algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present MagicGripper, a multimodal sensor-integrated gripper designed for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Building on our prior design, MagicTac, we develop a compact variant, mini-MagicTac, which features a three-dimensional, multi-layered grid embedded in a soft elastomer. MagicGripper integrates mini-MagicTac, enabling high-resolution tactile feedback alongside proximity and visual sensing within a compact, gripper-compatible form factor. We conduct a thorough evaluation of mini-MagicTac's performance, demonstrating its capabilities in spatial resolution, contact localization, and force regression. We also assess its robustness across manufacturing variability, mechanical deformation, and sensing performance under real-world conditions. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of MagicGripper through three representative robotic tasks: a teleoperated assembly task, a contact-based alignment task, and an autonomous robotic grasping task. Across these experiments, MagicGripper exhibits reliable multimodal perception, accurate force estimation, and high adaptability to challenging manipulation scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of MagicGripper as a practical and versatile tool for embodied intelligence in complex, contact-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Digital twins enable full-reference quality assessment of photoacoustic image reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</description>

      <title>Cognitive-Radio Functionality: A Novel Configuration for STAR-RIS assisted RSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive radio rate-splitting multiple access (CR-RSMA) has emerged as a promising multiple access framework that can efficiently manage interference and adapt dynamically to heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To effectively support such demanding access schemes, programmable wireless environments have attracted considerable attention, especially through simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which can enable full-space control of signal propagation in asymmetric user deployments. In this paper, we propose the cognitive radio (CR) functionality for STAR-RIS-assisted CR-RSMA systems, leveraging the unique capability of the STAR-RIS to combine element and power splitting for adaptive control of transmission and reflection in CR scenarios. Specifically, the proposed CR functionality partitions the STAR-RIS into two regions independently controlling the transmission and reflection of signals, simultaneously ensuring the required QoS for the primary user and enhancing the performance of the secondary user. To accurately characterize the system performance, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic rate of the secondary user and the outage rate of the primary user under Nakagami-m fading. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively manages interference, guarantees the QoS of the primary user, and significantly improves the throughput of the secondary user, highlighting STAR-RIS as an efficient solution for CR-RSMA-based services.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Phase Retrieval for Multi-View Compressive Networked Sensing With Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the multi-view compressive phase retrieval problem in a distributed sensor network, where each sensor device, limited by storage and sensing capabilities, can access only intensity measurements from an unknown part of the global sparse vector. The goal is to enable each sensor to recover its observable sparse signal when measurements are corrupted by outliers. To achieve reliable local signal recovery with limited data access, we propose a distributed reconstruction algorithm that enables collaboration among sensor devices without the need to share individual raw data. The proposed scheme employs a two-stage approach that first recovers the amplitude of the global signal (at a central server) and subsequently estimates the observable nonzero signal entries (at each local device). Our analytic results show that perfect global signal amplitude recovery can be achieved under mild conditions on the support size of sparse outliers and the view blockage level. In addition, the exact reconstruction of locally observed signal components is shown to be attainable in the noise-free case by solving a binary optimization problem, subject to a mild requirement on the structure of the sensing matrix. Computer simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Knockoff-Guided Compressive Sensing: A Statistical Machine Learning Framework for Support-Assured Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework, referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase. Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction, especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Regularized Tyler's M-Estimator Using Approximate LOOCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator (RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function; namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an $O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Enabled Integrated Sensing and Wireless Powered Communication: A Robust Multi-Objective Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with wireless power transfer (WPT) where multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based radars serve multiple clusters of energy-limited communication users in addition to their sensing functionality. In this architecture, the radars sense the environment in phase 1 (namely sensing phase) and meanwhile, the communications users (nodes) harvest and store the energy from the radar transmit signals. The stored energy is then used for information transmission from the nodes to UAVs in phase 2, i.e., uplink phase. Performance of the radar systems depends on the transmit signals as well as the receive filters; the energy of the transmit signals also affects the communication network because it serves as the source of uplink powers. Therefore, we cast a multi-objective design problem addressing performance of both radar and communication systems via optimizing UAV trajectories, radar transmit waveforms, radar receive filters, time scheduling and uplink powers. The design problem is further formulated as a robust non-convex optimization problem taking into account the the user location uncertainty. Hence, we devise a method based on alternating optimization followed by concepts of fractional programming, S-procedure, and tricky majorization-minimization (MM) technique to tackle it. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for different scenarios.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication in Maritime Emergency Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With line-of-sight mode deployment and fast response, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique, is poised to deliver high-quality communication and sensing services in maritime emergency scenarios. In practice, however, the real-time transmission of ISAC signals at the UAV side cannot be realized unless the reliable wireless fronthaul link between the terrestrial base station and UAV are available. This paper proposes a multicarrier-division duplex based joint fronthaul-access scheme, where mutually orthogonal subcarrier sets are leveraged to simultaneously support four types of fronthaul/access transmissions. In order to maximize the end-to-end communication rate while maintaining an adequate sensing quality-of-service (QoS) in such a complex scheme, the UAV trajectory, subcarrier assignment and power allocation are jointly optimized. The overall optimization process is designed in two stages. As the emergency area is usually far away from the coast, the optimal initial operating position for the UAV is first found. Once the UAV passes the initial operating position, the UAV's trajectory and resource allocation are optimized during the mission period to maximize the end-to-end communication rate under the constraint of minimum sensing QoS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with the joint fronthaul-access optimization problem in maritime ISAC networks, offering the advantages over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the site-specific distribution of the wireless channel within a particular environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we combine the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with generative modeling, in particular, sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM), to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our methods can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, they are physically interpretable and generalize over system configurations without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Estimating Time Delays between Signals under Mixed Noise Influence with Novel Cross- and Bispectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common problem to signal processing are biases introduced by correlated noise. When quantifying time delays between two signals, mixed noise introduces a bias towards zero delay in conventional delay estimates based on the cross- or bispectrum. Here we propose two novel time delay estimators that address these shortcomings: (1) A cross-spectrum based approach that relies on estimating the periodicity of the phase spectrum rather than its slope, and (2) a bispectrum based approach, bispectral antisymmetrization, which removes contributions from not just Gaussian but all independent sources. In a simulation study, we compare conventional and novel TDE approaches and resolve differences in performance with respect to noise Gaussianity and auto-correlation structure. As a proof-of concept, we also perform TDE analysis on a neural stimulation dataset (n=3). We find that antisymmetrization consistently outperforms conventional bispectral methods at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and prevents spurious zero-delay estimates in all mixed-noise environments. Time delay estimation based on phase periodicity also improves signal sensitivity compared to conventional cross-spectral methods. These observations are stable with respect to the magnitude of the delay and the statistical properties of the noise.</description>

      <title>SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</description>

      <title>Joint Location and Velocity Estimation and Fundamental CRLB Analysis for Cell-Free MIMO-ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental performance analysis of joint location and velocity estimation in a cell-free (CF) MIMO integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Unlike prior studies that primarily rely on continuous-time signal models, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario in the discrete-time digital domain. Specifically, we first formulate a logarithmic likelihood function (LLF) and corresponding maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for both single- and multiple-target sensing. Building upon the proposed LLF framework, closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint location and velocity estimation are derived under deterministic, unknown, and spatially varying radar cross-section (RCS) models. These CRLBs can serve as a fundamental performance metric to guide CF MIMO-ISAC system design. To enhance tractability, we also develop a class of simplified closed-form CRLBs, referred to as approximate CRLBs, along with a rigorous analysis of the conditions under which they remain accurate. Furthermore, we investigate how the sampling rate, squared effective bandwidth, and time width influence CRLB performance. For multi-target scenarios, the concepts of safety distance and safety velocity are introduced to characterize the conditions under which the CRLBs converge to their single-target counterparts. Extensive simulations using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) validate the theoretical findings and provide practical insights for CF MIMO-ISAC system design</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity MUSIC Algorithm: From Finite-Precision Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high computational complexity of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is mainly caused by the subspace decomposition and spectrum search, especially for frequent real-time applications or massive sensors. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MUSIC algorithm from finite-precision arithmetic perspective. First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the classic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating this computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision method is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method partitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block computations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use high-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we develop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and multiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed finite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more than 50\% computational cost.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Fast Fourier Transform for Rapid Community Travel Distance and Step Estimation in Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of gait characteristics, including step length, step velocity, and travel distance, is critical for assessing mobility in toddlers, children and teens with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and typically developing (TD) peers. This study introduces a novel method leveraging Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-derived step frequency from a single waist-worn consumer-grade accelerometer to predict gait parameters efficiently. The proposed FFT-based step frequency detection approach, combined with regression-derived stride length estimation, enables precise measurement of temporospatial gait features across various walking and running speeds. Our model, developed from a diverse cohort of children aged 3-16, demonstrated high accuracy in step length estimation (R^2=0.92, RMSE = 0.06) using only step frequency and height as inputs. Comparative analysis with ground-truth observations and AI-driven Walk4Me models validated the FFT-based method, showing strong agreement across step count, step frequency, step length, step velocity, and travel distance metrics. The results highlight the feasibility of using widely available mobile devices for gait assessment in real-world settings, offering a scalable solution for monitoring disease progression and mobility changes in individuals with DMD. Future work will focus on refining model performance and expanding applicability to additional movement disorders.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Joint Sensing, Communication, Powering and Backhaul Transmission in Maritime Monitoring Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of energy-constrained maritime monitoring networks by proposing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing, communication, powering and backhaul transmission scheme with a tailored time-division duplex frame structure. Within each time slot, the UAV sequentially implements sensing, wireless charging and uplink receiving with buoys, and lastly forwards part of collected data to the central ship via backhaul links. Considering the tight coupling among these functions, we jointly optimize time allocation, UAV trajectory, UAV-buoy association, and power scheduling to maximize the performance of data collection, with the practical consideration of sea clutter effects during UAV sensing. A novel optimization framework combining alternating optimization, quadratic transform and augmented first-order Taylor approximation is developed, which demonstrates good convergence behavior and robustness. Simulation results show that under sensing quality-of-service constraint, buoys are able to achieve an average data rate over 22bps/Hz using around 2mW harvested power per active time slot, validating the scheme's effectiveness for open-sea monitoring. Additionally, it is found that under the influence of sea clutters, the optimal UAV trajectory always keeps a certain distance with buoys to strike a balance between sensing and other multi-functional transmissions.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Driven Distributed Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework. Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion. Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM) with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves a good performance.</description>

      <title>Mirror Online Conformal Prediction with Intermittent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.</description>
