      <title>Multiscale Unsteady Conjugate Transfer via Modal Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale methodology for efficient unsteady conjugate heat transfer simulations.
  The solid domain is modelled by coupling a global representation of the temperature field, based on the eigenfunctions of the unsteady heat conduction equation, with a local, fine-scale-resolving solution of the heat conduction equation at the conjugate interface.
  To address the disparate time scales and enhance convergence, the decoupled modal equations are leveraged to enable targeted acceleration of the longest thermal time scales.
  One-dimensional analyses validate the properties of the scheme, while scale-resolving simulations demonstrate its practical application for steady and unsteady problems. Notably, the method achieves up to a fourfold reduction in computational time to reach steady thermal conditions compared to conventional conjugate simulations, without introducing significant computational overhead or error, offering an accurate and accelerated framework for unsteady thermal analysis.</description>

      <title>Steinberg-Guinan strength model for rhenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhenium, Re, is used as an x-ray shield in laser-driven material property experiments, where its strength at high pressures can be a consideration in the design, modeling, and interpretation. We present a Steinberg-Guinan (SG) strength model for Re, tailored for use in high-pressure dynamic loading simulations. Parameters for the SG model were derived from recent atom-in-jellium predictions of the shear modulus under compression and experimental data on work-hardening from rolled-bar studies. The ambient shear modulus was fixed to the measured value, and the pressure-hardening parameter was fitted to the atom-in-jellium predictions up to 1 TPa. The shear modulus model was still a reasonable fit beyond 25 TPa. Thermal softening was estimated from the thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were extracted by fitting the model to Knoop microhardness measurements under known plastic strains. The resulting model captures the observed hardening behavior but predicts significantly lower flow stresses at high pressures than diamond anvil cell observations suggest, implying that Re may exhibit enhanced strength at megabar pressures. These results provide a basis for improved modeling of strength in Re under extreme conditions and suggest directions for further theoretical and experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of $\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic devices through tailored edge engineering.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission in a model cluster using time-dependent density functional theory and the time-dependent surface-flux method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission using a one-dimensional time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) model. Photoelectron spectra are computed with the time-dependent surface-flux (t-SURFF) method. In addition to the expected above-threshold ionization (ATI) comb, we observe peaks that arise from long-lived plasmon oscillations and the associated electron emission occurring after the laser pulse. We further analyze the positions of these peaks and their scaling behavior with the laser intensity.</description>

      <title>Phase-engineered Non-degenerate Sliding Ferroelectricity Enables Tunable Photovoltaics in Monolayer Janus In2S2Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their enhanced efficiencies of charge separation and tunability, constitute promising platforms for next-generation photovoltaic devices. However, recent systems predominantly exhibit dual degenerate polarization states with weak intensity, hindering the optimal manipulations of photovoltaic effects through sliding ferroelectricity. Here, we address this limitation by introducing two strengthened and distinct non-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se, which can be achieved by Se-to-S substitution in monolayer In2Se3. First-principles calculations validate the experimental synthesis of this structure and its capability for reversible phase transitions triggered by atomic layer sliding, and a series of superior photovoltaic performances are demonstrated in such unique Janus In2S2Se, accompanied by a detailed analysis of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity modulates distinct photovoltaic characteristics. The WZ' to ZB' transition can increase the carrier mobility and moderate the band gap while inducing an indirect-to-direct transition, yielding a marked red-shift and enhancement of the photocurrent peak in the infrared spectrum. Conversely, the WZ' phase, benefiting from enhanced polarization, delivers superior photoelectric conversion efficiency in the visible light region. This work establishes a phase-engineered framework of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity orchestrates distinct photovoltaic behaviors, and the intrinsic physical correlations may offer novel perspectives for designing and regulating innovative photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic Confinement Potentials and the Generation of Numerical Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to develop novel reusable open source infrastructure [Lehtola, J. Chem. Phys. 159, 180901 (2023)] for numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). Soft confinement potentials are typically used to force the NAO radial basis functions ${\psi}_{nl}(r)$ to vanish smoothly in increasing $r$ and to generate localized unoccupied states; we review such potentials and other commonly-used techniques in NAO generation as a follow-up to our recent study on atoms in hard-wall confinement [{\AA}str\"om and Lehtola, J. Phys. Chem. A 129, 2791 (2025)]. In addition to NAO generation, confinement potentials are also employed to simulate environmental effects in other research areas, such as studies of (i) atoms in solids, (ii) quantum dots, and (iii) high-pressure chemistry. As in our earlier work, we perform fully numerical density functional calculations with spherically averaged densities, as is usual in NAO studies. Our calculations employ the the finite element method (FEM) implemented in the HelFEM program, yielding variational energies and enabling the use of various boundary conditions. We consider four families of potentials to study the Mg and Ca atoms, which are textbook examples of extended electronic structures. We show that the resulting ground-state orbitals are surprisingly insensitive to the employed form of the confinement potential, and that the orbitals decay quickly under confinement. We study increasingly steep potentials and examine how they approach the hard-wall limit. Finally, we assess NAO basis set truncation errors for types of singular potentials that are now broadly used in the NAO literature.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with just-in-time compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning of representative local atomic arrangements in molecular dynamics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations present a data-mining challenge, given that they can generate a considerable amount of data but often rely on limited or biased human interpretation to examine their information content. By not asking the right questions of MD data we may miss critical information hidden within it. We combine dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) to quantitatively characterize prevalent coordination environments of chemical species within MD data. By focusing on local coordination, we significantly reduce the amount of data to be analyzed by extracting all distinct molecular formulas within a given coordination sphere. We then efficiently combine UMAP and HDBSCAN with alignment or shape-matching algorithms to partition these formulas into structural isomer families indicating their relative populations. The method was employed to reveal details of cation coordination in electrolytes based on molecular liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>An efficient explicit implementation of a near-optimal quantum algorithm for simulating linear dissipative differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient block-encoding technique for the implementation of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations (LCHS) for modeling dissipative initial-value problems. This algorithm approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We introduce an efficient encoding of the LCHS into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function. This significantly simplifies block-encoding of a dissipative problem and allows one to perform an exponential number of Hamiltonian simulations by a single Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) circuit. The resulting LCHS circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Universal exotic dynamics in critical mesoscopic systems: Simulating the square root of Avogadro's number of spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>FDTD with Auxiliary Bath Fields for Condensed-Phase Polaritonics: Fundamentals and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding condensed-phase polariton experiments requires accurately accounting for both realistic cavity geometries and the interplay between polaritons and material dark modes arising from microscopic molecular interactions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach numerically propagates classical Maxwell's equations in the time domain, offering a versatile scheme for modeling polaritons in realistic cavities. However, the simple dielectric functions routinely used in FDTD often fail to describe molecular details. Consequently, standard FDTD calculations, to date, cannot accurately describe processes involving the complex coupling between polaritons and dark modes, such as polariton relaxation, transport, and condensation. For more faithful simulations of the energy flow between polaritons and dark modes, herein, local bath degrees of freedom coupled to the material polarization are explicitly included in FDTD to describe the dark-mode dynamics. This method -- FDTD with auxiliary bath fields (FDTD-Bath) -- is implemented in the open-source MEEP package by adding a Lorentz-Bath material susceptibility, where explicit bath modes are coupled to conventional Lorentz oscillators. With this Lorentz-Bath susceptibility, linear polariton spectra and Rabi-splitting-dependent polariton relaxation rates in planar Fabry--P\'erot cavities are reproduced more accurately than those with the conventional Lorentz susceptibility. Supported by a user-friendly Python interface and efficient MPI parallelism, the FDTD-Bath approach implemented in MEEP is ready to model a wide range of polariton phenomena involving realistic cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>Fully data-driven inverse hyperelasticity with hyper-network neural ODE fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to classical inverse methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating loss of variance in ensemble data assimilation: machine learning-based and distance-free localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Hop-Decorate: An Automated Atomistic Workflow for Generating Defect Transport Data in Chemically Complex Materials</title>

Abstract: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.</description>
