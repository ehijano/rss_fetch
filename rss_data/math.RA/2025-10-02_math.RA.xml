      <title>The Kernel and Image of Orbit Homomorphisms for the Witt Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Witt algebra $W_{\geq -1}$ is the Lie algebra of algebraic vector fields on a line. We investigate the two-sided ideal structure of its universal enveloping algebra, by studying the orbit homomorphisms $\Psi_n: U(W_{\geq -1}) \rightarrow T_n$, an infinite family of homomorphisms to noncommutative Noetherian algebras. The orbit homomorphisms lift primitive ideals from solvable Lie algebras to $U(W_{\geq -1})$, thereby playing a central role in the orbit method for the Witt algebra. We prove that the kernel of any orbit homomorphism is generated by an infinite set of differentiators as a one-sided ideal, whilst being generated by any single element of this set as a two-sided ideal. One consequence is an explicit description of primitive and semi-primitive ideals of $U(W_{\geq -1})$ corresponding to one-point local functions. We also prove that the image $B_n$ of the nth orbit homomorphism is both non-Noetherian and birational to the Noetherian algebra $T_n$. On the other hand, the degree zero subring of $B_n$ is left and right Noetherian, and we conjecture that the same holds for $U(W_{\geq -1})$.</description>

      <title>On global isomorphisms and a closure property of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a semigroup (written multiplicatively). Endowed with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $S$ on its parts, the non-empty subsets of $S$ form themselves a semigroup, denoted by $\mathcal P(S)$. Accordingly, we say that a semigroup $H$ is globally isomorphic to a semigroup $K$ if $\mathcal P(H)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal P(K)$; and that a class $\mathscr C$ of semigroups is globally closed if a semigroup in $\mathscr C$ can only be globally isomorphic to an isomorphic copy of a semigroup in the same class.
  We show that the classes of groups, torsion-free monoids, and numerical monoids are each globally closed. The first result extends a 1967 theorem of Shafer, while the last relies non-trivially on the second and on a classical theorem of Kneser from additive number theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting generalized inverses of a sum with a radical element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with identity and $J(R)$ be its Jacobson radical. Assume that $a\in R$ is $(b,c)$-invertible and $j_a,j_b,j_c\in J(R)$. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for $a+j_a$ to be $(b+j_b,c+j_c)$-invertible. As an application, corresponding results on generalized inverses of dual matrices are derived.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each \((d+1)\)-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a \(d\)-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical \(d\)-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a \((d+1)\)-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>

      <title>On the Nowicki Conjecture for the free Lie algebra of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K[X_n]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be the polynomial algebra in n variables over a field K of characteristic zero. A locally nilpotent linear derivation \delta of K[X_n] is called Weitzenb\"ock due to his well known result from 1932 stating that the algebra \text{\rm ker}(\delta)=K[X_n]^{\delta} of constants of $\delta$ is finitely generated. The explicit form of a generating set of $K[X_n,Y_n]^{\delta}$ was conjectured by Nowicki in 1994 in the case \delta was such that \delta(y_{i})=x_{i}$, $\delta(x_i)=0, i=1,\ldots,n. Nowicki's conjecture turned out to be true and, recently, has been applied to several relatively free associative algebras. In this paper, we consider the free Lie algebra \mathcal{L}(x,y) of rank 2 generated by x and y over K and we assume the Weitzenb\"ock derivation \delta sending y to x, and x to zero. We introduce the idea of pseudodeterminants and we present a characterization of Hall monomials that are constants showing they are not so far from being pseudodeterminants. We also give a complete list of generators of the constants of degree less than 7 which are, of course, pseudodeterminants.</description>

      <title>Notes on the ordered set $A^A$. Part III. Exponent-cancellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of exponent-cancellation for finite ordered sets. It is known that $A$ can be reconstructed from $A^{A}$, from $(A^{A})^{A}$, and from $A^{A^{A}}$. In this note we prove the next result in this hierarchy: the ordered set $(A^{A^{A}})^{A^{A^{A}}}$ determines $A$ up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Notes on the ordered set $A^A$. Part IV. The dual ${}^{A}\!A$ of $A^A$ for finite ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite ordered set. Define the ordered set $A^A$ as the set of all maps from $A$ to $A$, ordered pointwise. Let ${}^{A} A$ be the dual of $A^A$.
  We prove results in the spirit of Parts~I--III, but now using both $A^A$ and ${}^{A}A$. For example, if \[ \Bigl({}^{{}^{ {}^{ {}^{A}A}A}A}A\Bigr)^{A^{A^{A}}} \] is isomorphic to \[ \Bigl({}^{ {}^{ {}^{ {}^{B}B}B}B}B\Bigr)^{B^{B^{B}}} \] for finite ordered sets $A$ and $B$, then $A$ is isomorphic to $B$.</description>

      <title>Divisibility by $p$ for Markoff-like Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the finite ordered sets $A, D$, write $A^D$ for the ordered set of isotone maps $D \to A$ with the pointwise order. It was proved in earlier work that the order structure of $A^A$ determines~$A$ up to isomorphism. In this note we extend the result to higher function ordered sets such as $A^{(A^A)}$ and $(A^A)^A$. Our main theorem shows that the structure of $A^D$ determines~$A$.</description>
