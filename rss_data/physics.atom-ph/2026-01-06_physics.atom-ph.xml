      <title>High-Resolution Spectroscopy of the X-A Transition of the Carbon Monoxide Dication CO$^{2+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report rovibronic spectra of the A $^3\Sigma^+$($v'=0-2$) - X $^3\Pi_\Omega(v=0)$ rovibronic transitions ($|\Omega|=0, 1$ and 2) of the CO$^{2+}$ doubly-charged molecular ion. Spectra were recorded at high resolution ($\sim 5$~cm$^{-1}$) in a fast beam of CO$^{2+}$ molecules by detecting the Coulomb explosion of the molecules upon excitation to the A state. Measurements were guided by \textit{ab initio} calculations which then assisted the assignment of the observed spectral features. Our results resolve the spin-orbit splittings of the ground vibronic state X $^3\Pi_\Omega(v=0)$, but not the rotational structure of the bands due to spectral congestion, and provide spectroscopic information on CO$^{2+}$ with unprecedented resolution. In doing so they expand our knowledge of this benchmark doubly charged molecular ion and expand the short list of doubly charged molecules studied at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Resolution of the hyperfine puzzle and its significance for two fermion Dirac atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom of assumed radius $R$ is proportional to $-1/R^3$, raising the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen, or positronium. We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\hbar/2mc$, but when $R&lt;\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>A quadratic-scaling algorithm with guaranteed convergence for quantum coupled-channel calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Soliton Thouless pumping engineered by inter-site nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study soliton Thouless pumping in an extended diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site nonlinearities and inter-site nonlinearities. We show that the inter-site nonlinearities can make solitons acquire anomalous transport distances far beyond the ones predicted by the linear bands, and the quantized displacements can be engineered well. We uncover that nonlinear instabilities require lower limits on sweeping rates for soliton pumping, challenging the common notion that slower modulation enables a more favorable realization of topological transport. The nonlinear interactions between solitons make multi-soliton pumping generally lack the robustness characteristic of Thouless pumping as linear systems. Our results provide many possibilities to engineer topological pumping by nonlinearities, and further make a step for applications of soliton pumping.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation with Rydberg ions in a Penning trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of Compact Acousto-Optic-Deflector Individual Addressing System for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact design for a beam-steering system based on acousto-optic-deflectors (AODs) used as an individual addressing system for trapped-ion quantum computing. The design targets to minimize the optomechanical degrees of freedom and the optical beam paths to improve optical stability, and we successfully implemented a solution with a compact footprint of less than 1 square foot. The system characterization results show that we achieve clean Gaussian beams at 355nm wavelength with a beam steering range of $\sim$50 times the beam diameter, and an intensity crosstalk of $&lt; 9 \times 10^{-4}$ at all neighboring ions in a five-ion chain. Based on these capabilities, we experimentally demonstrate individual addressing of a 30-ion chain. We estimate the beam switching time of the AOD to be $\sim$240 ns. The compact system design is expected to provide high optical stability, providing the potential for high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum computing with long ion chains.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning with Noisy Dataset for Rydberg Microwave Sensors Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a self-supervised deep learning framework for Rydberg sensors that enables single-shot noise suppression matching the accuracy of multi-measurement averaging. The framework eliminates the need for clean reference signals (hardly required in quantum sensing) by training on two sets of noisy signals with identical statistical distributions. When evaluated on Rydberg sensing datasets, the framework outperforms wavelet transform and Kalman filtering, achieving a denoising effect equivalent to 10,000-set averaging while reducing computation time by three orders of magnitude. We further validate performance across diverse noise profiles and quantify the complexity-performance trade-off of U-Net and Transformer architectures, providing actionable guidance for optimizing deep learning-based denoising in Rydberg sensor systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization of modulation transfer protocol for Rydberg RF receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically and experimentally the recently demonstrated modulation transfer protocol [D.-A. Trinh, K. V. Adwaith, M. Branco, A. Rouxel, S. Welinski, P. Berger, F. Goldfarb, and F. Bretenaker, Applied Physics Letters 125, 154001 (2024)] aiming at extending the bandwidth of quantum RF receivers based on hot Rydberg atoms. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the coupling beam, which is transformed by the nonlinear response of the atoms into an amplitude modulation of the probe beam. We develop a theoretical model to optimize both the modulation frequency and the modulation amplitude of the coupling beam, thereby maximizing the atomic response. Once optimized, the sensitivity to detuned RF fields of this modulation transfer protocol is compared with that of the conventional protocol. This comparison shows that the new protocol outperforms the usual one as soon as the RF signal to be measured is detuned by more than a few MHz and offers a complementary approach to increase the detection bandwidth. In all cases, the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed microwave spectroscopy of sodium least-bound molecular states, improving the precision of the knowledge of their energies at zero magnetic field by almost three orders of magnitude. Our experimental observations give us access also to states submitted to predissociation, a phenomenon where a bound molecular state can naturally decay into the continuum. Our findings are compared to numerical calculations based on the latest interpolation of sodium interaction potentials and show good agreement, with slight discrepancies in the zero-field energy of the molecular states, suggesting a need for small adjustment of the interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

Abstract: I consider the so-called nuclear polarization correction to the 1S-levels in light to intermediate muonic atoms. An easy to use recipe to compute it is given. The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Quantum Copying: an adaptive ancillary systems and its limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel state-dependent quantum cloning (copying) process by introducing a new class of ancillary system -- an adaptive ancilla -- modifying the conventional state-dependent quantum copying process. This state-dependent ancillary system is not pre-engineered to match the quantum state to be cloned; rather, it dynamically aligns with the quantum state to be cloned via interaction. However, the space of states that it can clone is restricted by the symmetry principles. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying via an adaptive ancilla. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, contains implicit structural information about the quantum state in the form of a structured set of dynamical response channels. We reinterpret the excited atomic state as a realization of an adaptive ancilla, and cloning of a photon polarization state occurs when the quantum state of an excited atom dynamically aligns with the polarization state of the photon through physical interaction. We demonstrate that the true limits of cloning arise solely not from the no-cloning theorem, but from the symmetries imposed on physical systems\textthreequartersemdash constraints which may, in principle, be relaxed or engineered in suitable quantum systems, for instance in Rydberg atoms.</description>
