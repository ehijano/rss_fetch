      <title>Reservoir computing for system identification and predictive control with limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is an industry standard control technique that iteratively solves an open-loop optimization problem to guide a system towards a desired state or trajectory. Consequently, an accurate forward model of system dynamics is critical for the efficacy of MPC and much recent work has been aimed at the use of neural networks to act as data-driven surrogate models to enable MPC. Perhaps the most common network architecture applied to this task is the recurrent neural network (RNN) due to its natural interpretation as a dynamical system. In this work, we assess the ability of RNN variants to both learn the dynamics of benchmark control systems and serve as surrogate models for MPC. We find that echo state networks (ESNs) have a variety of benefits over competing architectures, namely reductions in computational complexity, longer valid prediction times, and reductions in cost of the MPC objective function.</description>

      <title>Maximizing User Connectivity in AI-Enabled Multi-UAV Networks: A Distributed Strategy Generalized to Arbitrary User Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been extensively applied to Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network (MUN) to effectively enable real-time adaptation to complex, time-varying environments. Nevertheless, most of the existing works assume a stationary user distribution (UD) or a dynamic one with predicted patterns. Such considerations may make the UD-specific strategies insufficient when a MUN is deployed in unknown environments. To this end, this paper investigates distributed user connectivity maximization problem in a MUN with generalization to arbitrary UDs. Specifically, the problem is first formulated into a time-coupled combinatorial nonlinear non-convex optimization with arbitrary underlying UDs. To make the optimization tractable, a multi-agent CNN-enhanced deep Q learning (MA-CDQL) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm integrates a ResNet-based CNN to the policy network to analyze the input UD in real time and obtain optimal decisions based on the extracted high-level UD features. To improve the learning efficiency and avoid local optimums, a heatmap algorithm is developed to transform the raw UD to a continuous density map. The map will be part of the true input to the policy network. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of UD heatmaps and the proposed algorithm in maximizing user connectivity as compared to K-means methods.</description>

      <title>Integrated Power and Thermal Management for Enhancing Energy Efficiency and Battery Life in Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective power and thermal management are essential for ensuring battery efficiency, safety, and longevity in Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles (CAEVs). However, real-time implementation is challenging due to the multi-timescale dynamics and complex trade-offs between energy consumption, battery degradation, traffic efficiency, and thermal regulation. This paper proposes a novel integrated power and thermal management strategy based on the Multi-Horizon Model Predictive Control (MH-MPC) framework to enhance energy efficiency, optimize battery temperature, ensure traffic safety and efficiency, and reduce battery degradation for CAEVs. The proposed strategy is formulated with a focus on the aging term, allowing it to more effectively manage the trade-offs between energy consumption, battery degradation, and temperature regulation. Moreover, the proposed strategy leverages multi-horizon optimization to achieve substantial improvements, reducing computation time by 7.18%, cooling energy by 14.22%, traction energy by 8.26%, battery degradation loss by over 22%, and battery degradation inconsistency by 36.57% compared to the benchmark strategy. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of key parameters, including weighting factors, sampling time, and prediction horizons, demonstrate the robustness of the strategy and underscore its potential for practical applications in extending battery lifespan while ensuring safety and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Agile UAV landing control on moving ship in adverse conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an agile Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) landing control by considering the effect of ship's oscillations and moving, and also disturbance (i.e., crosswind) is considered. The presented control system can make the quadrotor UAV autonomously land whilst overcoming these adverse conditions, and the addition of a rudder beneath each propeller is designed to increase the yaw authority which is found to be lacking in heavy-lift quadrotor UAV. The PID flight control system is proposed based on reference-point tracking, allowing the UAV to follow any desired path in 3D space whilst simultaneously yawing to face any desired heading. Realistic saturation limits on actuator outputs to ensure the real-world performance of actuators. Disturbances include randomised gusting wind in 3 axes, and sensor noise on translation and rotation signals to represent noise from the GPS and accelerometer respectively. The results from the simulations demonstrate that the UAV is capable of landing on a ship which is moving with varying heading and oscillating vertically on ocean waves and has the ability to time its descent such that it meets the ship at the peak of a wave to minimise the relative velocity.</description>

      <title>Unmanned F/A-18 Aircraft Landing Control on Aircraft Carrier in Adverse Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier landings are a difficult control task due to wind disturbance and a changing trajectory. Demand for carrier-based drones is increasing. A robust and accurate landing control system is crucial to meet this demand. Control performance can be improved by using observers to estimate unknown variables and disturbances for use in feedback. This paper applies a nonlinear observer to estimate the combined disturbance in the pitch dynamics of an F/A-18 during carrier landing. Additionally, controllers to regulate the velocity, rate of descent and vertical position are designed. A full model, including the nonlinear flight dynamics, controller, carrier deck motion, wind and measurement noise is modelled in software. Combined with proportional derivative control, the proposed pitch control method is shown to be very effective converging 85% faster than a PID controller. The simulations, verify that the pitch controller can quickly track a time-varying reference despite noise and disturbances.</description>

      <title>Analysing control-theoretic properties of nonlinear synthetic biology circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic biology is a recent area of biological engineering, whose aim is to provide cells with novel functionalities. A number of important results regarding the development of control circuits in synthetic biology have been achieved during the last decade. A differential geometry approach can be used for the analysis of said systems, which are often nonlinear. Here we demonstrate the application of such tools to analyse the structural identifiability, observability, accessibility, and controllability of several biomolecular systems. We focus on a set of synthetic circuits of current interest, which can perform several tasks, both in open loop and closed loop settings. We analyse their properties with our own methods and tools; further, we describe a new open-source implementation of the techniques.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperative Strategies for Multi-Agent Shepherding via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) approach to address the multi-agent shepherding control problem, departing from the conventional assumption of cohesive target groups. Our two-layer control architecture consists of a low-level controller that guides each herder to contain a specific target within a goal region, while a high-level layer dynamically selects from multiple targets the one an herder should aim at corralling and containing. Cooperation emerges naturally, as herders autonomously choose distinct targets to expedite task completion. We further extend this approach to large-scale systems, where each herder applies a shared policy, trained with few agents, while managing a fixed subset of agents.</description>

      <title>Cell Balancing Paradigms: Advanced Types, Algorithms, and Optimization Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation efficiency of the electric transportation, energy storage, and grids mainly depends on the fundamental characteristics of the employed batteries. Fundamental variables like voltage, current, temperature, and estimated parameters, like the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery pack, influence the functionality of the system. This motivates the implementation of a Battery Management System (BMS), critical for managing and maintaining the health, safety, and performance of a battery pack. This is ensured by measuring parameters like temperature, cell voltage, and pack current. It also involves monitoring insulation levels and fire hazards, while assessing the prevailing useful life of the batteries and estimating the SoC and State of Health (SoH). Additionally, the system manages and controls key activities like cell balancing and charge/discharge processes. Thus functioning of the battery can be optimised, by guaranteeing the vital parameters to be well within the prescribed range. This article discusses the several cell balancing schemes, and focuses on the intricacies of cell balancing algorithms and optimisation methods for cell balancing. We begin surveying recent cell balancing algorithms and then provide selection guidelines taking into account their advantages, disadvantages, and applications. Finally, we discuss various optimization algorithms and outline the essential parameters involved in the cell balancing process.</description>

      <title>Time-to-reach Bounds for Verification of Dynamical Systems Using the Koopman Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel Koopman spectrum-based reachability verification method for nonlinear systems. Contrary to conventional methods that focus on characterizing all potential states of a dynamical system over a presupposed time span, our approach seeks to verify the reachability by assessing the non-emptiness of estimated time-to-reach intervals without engaging in the explicit computation of reachable set. Based on the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, we reformulate the problem of verifying existence of reachable trajectories into the problem of determining feasible time-to-reach bounds required for system reachability. By solving linear programming (LP) problems, our algorithm can effectively estimate all potential time intervals during which a dynamical system can enter (and exit) target sets from given initial sets over an unbounded time horizon. Finally, we demonstrate our method in challenging settings, such as verifying the reachability between non-convex or even disconnected sets, as well as backward reachability and multiple entries into target sets. Additionally, we validate its applicability in addressing real-world challenges and scalability to high-dimensional systems through case studies in verifying the reachability of the cart-pole and multi-agent consensus systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Min-Max MPC for LPV Systems with Unknown Scheduling Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. Contrary to existing data-driven LPV control approaches, we assume that the scheduling signal is unknown during offline data collection and online system operation. Assuming a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) description for the scheduling signal, we develop a novel data-driven characterization of the consistent system matrices using only input-state data. The proposed data-driven min-max MPC minimizes a tractable upper bound on the worst-case cost over the consistent system matrices set and over all scheduling signals satisfying the QMI. The proposed approach guarantees recursive feasibility, closed-loop exponential stability and constraint satisfaction if it is feasible at the initial time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in simulation.</description>

      <title>Learning Subsystem Dynamics in Nonlinear Systems via Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) are emerging as a powerful modeling tool that integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques. While most research has focused on modeling the entire dynamics of interconnected systems, the potential for identifying and modeling individual subsystems while operating as part of a larger system has been overlooked. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel method for using pHNNs to identify such subsystems based solely on input-output measurements. By utilizing the inherent compositional property of the port-Hamiltonian systems, we developed an algorithm that learns the dynamics of individual subsystems, without requiring direct access to their internal states. On top of that, by choosing an output error (OE) model structure, we have been able to handle measurement noise effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tests on interconnected systems, including multi-physics scenarios, demonstrating its potential for identifying subsystem dynamics and facilitating their integration into new interconnected models.</description>

      <title>Bias correction and instrumental variables for direct data-driven model-reference control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing noisy data is a central challenge in direct data-driven control design. We propose an approach for synthesizing model-reference controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using noisy state-input data, employing novel noise mitigation techniques. Specifically, we demonstrate that using data-based covariance parameterization of the controller enables bias-correction and instrumental variable techniques within the data-driven optimization, thus reducing measurement noise effects as data volume increases. The number of decision variables remains independent of dataset size, making this method scalable to large datasets. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Frequency stability of grid-forming power-limiting droop control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze power-limiting grid-forming droop control used for grid-connected power converters. Compared to conventional grid-forming droop control, power-limiting droop control explicitly accounts for active power limits of the generation (e.g., renewables) interfaced by the converter. While power-limiting droop control has been demonstrated to work well in simulation and experiment, analytical results are not readily available. To address this gap, we first reformulate the dynamics of a power system comprised of converters using power-limiting droop controller as a projected dynamical system in nodal coordinates. Next, we change coordinates from nodal coordinates to edge coordinates to interpret the resulting dynamics as primal-dual dynamics associated with a constrained power flow problem. Leveraging convergence results for primal-dual dynamics, we show that, under mild feasibility assumptions, the frequency dynamics of a power system comprised of converters using power-limiting droop control are globally asymptotically stable with respect to the set of optimizers of its associated constrained power flow problem. Moreover, we show that (i) the converter frequencies synchronize to a common synchronous frequency for each grid-forming converter, and (ii) characterize the synchronous frequency in the case of converters operating at their power limit. Specifically, this result establishes that power-limiting droop control exhibits properties similar to so-called power-sharing in conventional unconstrained droop control.</description>

      <title>Fast and interpretable electricity consumption scenario generation for individual consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable the transition from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, the low-voltage grid needs to be reinforced at a faster pace and on a larger scale than was historically the case. To efficiently plan reinforcements, one needs to estimate the currents and voltages throughout the grid, which are unknown but can be calculated from the grid layout and the electricity consumption time series of each consumer. However, for many consumers, these time series are unknown and have to be estimated from the available consumer information. We refer to this task as scenario generation. The state-of-the-art approach that generates electricity consumption scenarios is complex, resulting in a computationally expensive procedure with only limited interpretability. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a fast and interpretable scenario generation technique based on predictive clustering trees (PCTs) that does not compromise accuracy. In our experiments on three datasets from different locations, we found that our proposed approach generates time series that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art while being at least 7 times faster in training and prediction. Moreover, the interpretability of the PCT allows domain experts to gain insight into their data while simultaneously building trust in the predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>3D-Printed Dual-Polarized Magneto-Electric Dipole Antenna with Wideband High Isolation for Full-Duplex Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel dual-port dual-polarized magneto-electric dipole (MED) antenna with orthogonal Gamma and inverted-Gamma shape probes, which was fabricated by means of an additive 3D metal printing process. Electromagnetic wave simulation and RF measurement report a resonance bandwidth from 3 GHz to 4 GHz at both MED's ports with respect to a standing wave ratio of less than 2. The cross-polarization isolation (XPI) between the MED's ports was also measured to be greater than 50 dB across its entire resonance bandwidth. The paper also thoroughly examines the impact of misalignments in the polarization of the MED probes on the XPI level. The broadband resonance and excellent isolation between the MED ports make it a strong candidate for a full-duplex wireless transceiver in network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Tangled Program Graphs as an alternative to DRL-based control algorithms for UAVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is currently the most popular AI-based approach to autonomous vehicle control. An agent, trained for this purpose in simulation, can interact with the real environment with a human-level performance. Despite very good results in terms of selected metrics, this approach has some significant drawbacks: high computational requirements and low explainability. Because of that, a DRL-based agent cannot be used in some control tasks, especially when safety is the key issue. Therefore we propose to use Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) as an alternative for deep reinforcement learning in control-related tasks. In this approach, input signals are processed by simple programs that are combined in a graph structure. As a result, TPGs are less computationally demanding and their actions can be explained based on the graph structure. In this paper, we present our studies on the use of TPGs as an alternative for DRL in control-related tasks. In particular, we consider the problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through the unknown environment based solely on the on-board LiDAR sensor. The results of our work show promising prospects for the use of TPGs in control related-tasks.</description>

      <title>Large problems are not necessarily hard: A case study on distributed NMPC paying off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key motivation in the development of distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) is to widen the computational bottleneck of centralized MPC for large-scale systems. Parallelizing computations among individual subsystems, distributed MPC has the prospect of scaling well for large networks. However, the communication demand may deteriorate the performance of iterative decentralized optimization, if excessively many optimizer iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multi-core computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative distributed MPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. For the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, distributed MPC and distributed Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) scale well as the required number of iterations does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multithreaded centralized solvers show competitive performance of the considered decentralized optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Barrier Certificate-based Simplex Architecture for Systems with Approximate and Hybrid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Barrier-based Simplex (Bb-Simplex), a new, provably correct design for runtime assurance of continuous dynamical systems. Bb-Simplex is centered around the Simplex control architecture, which consists of a high-performance advanced controller that is not guaranteed to maintain safety of the plant, a verified-safe baseline controller, and a decision module that switches control of the plant between the two controllers to ensure safety without sacrificing performance. In Bb-Simplex, Barrier certificates are used to prove that the baseline controller ensures safety. Furthermore, Bb-Simplex features a new automated method for deriving, from the barrier certificate, the conditions for switching between the controllers. Our method is based on the Taylor expansion of the barrier certificate and yields computationally inexpensive switching conditions.
  We also propose extensions to Bb-Simplex to enable its use in hybrid systems, which have multiple modes each with its own dynamics, and to support its use when only approximate dynamics (not exact dynamics) are available, for both continuous-time and hybrid dynamical systems.
  We consider significant applications of Bb-Simplex to microgrids featuring advanced controllers in the form of neural networks trained using reinforcement learning. These microgrids are modeled in RTDS, an industry-standard high-fidelity, real-time power systems simulator. Our results demonstrate that Bb-Simplex can automatically derive switching conditions for complex continuous-time and hybrid systems, the switching conditions are not overly conservative, and Bb-Simplex ensures safety even in the presence of adversarial attacks on the neural controller when only approximate dynamics (with an error bound) are available.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient-based Model Free Optimal LQG Control with a Probabilistic Risk Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a model-free optimal control design that minimizes an infinite horizon average expected quadratic cost of states and control actions subject to a probabilistic risk or chance constraint using input-output data. In particular, we consider linear time-invariant systems and design an optimal controller within the class of linear state feedback control. Three different policy gradient (PG) based algorithms, natural policy gradient (NPG), Gauss-Newton policy gradient (GNPG), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), are developed, and compared with the optimal risk-neutral linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and a scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) technique via numerical simulations. The convergence properties and the accuracy of all the algorithms are compared numerically. We also establish analytical convergence properties of the NPG and GNPG algorithms under the known model scenario, while the proof of convergence for the unknown model scenario is part of our ongoing work.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Iterative Adaptation of Feedforward Controllers: an Application on Electromechanical Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromechanical switching devices such as relays, solenoid valves, and contactors offer several technical and economic advantages that make them widely used in industry. However, uncontrolled operations result in undesirable impact-related phenomena at the end of the stroke. As a solution, different soft-landing controls have been proposed. Among them, feedforward control with iterative techniques that adapt its parameters is a solution when real-time feedback is not available. However, these techniques typically require a large number of operations to converge or are computationally intensive, which limits a real implementation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the iterative adaptation that is able to eventually adapt the search coordinate system and to reduce the search dimensional size in order to accelerate convergence. Moreover, it automatically toggles between a derivative-free and a gradient-based method to balance exploration and exploitation. To demonstrate the high potential of the proposal, each novel part of the algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach via simulation.</description>

      <title>Entropy-regularized Diffusion Policy with Q-Ensembles for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents advanced techniques of training diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL). At the core is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transfers a complex action distribution into a standard Gaussian and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state with a corresponding reverse-time SDE, like a typical diffusion policy. We show that such an SDE has a solution that we can use to calculate the log probability of the policy, yielding an entropy regularizer that improves the exploration of offline datasets. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate value functions from out-of-distribution data points, we further propose to learn the lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for more robust policy improvement. By combining the entropy-regularized diffusion policy with Q-ensembles in offline RL, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks in D4RL benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/ruoqizzz/Entropy-Regularized-Diffusion-Policy-with-QEnsemble.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate &amp; Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</description>

      <title>Unmasking the Role of Remote Sensors in Comfort, Energy and Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single-zone multi-node systems (SZMRSs), temperature controls rely on a single probe near the thermostat, resulting in temperature discrepancies that cause thermal discomfort and energy waste. Augmenting smart thermostats (STs) with per-room sensors has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers. This paper leverages additional sensory information to empirically characterize the services provided by buildings, including thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and demand response (DR). Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMNSs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3{\deg}F to 2.5{\deg}F from the average. Moreover, in 95% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25%. This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMNSs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robot Navigation Policies with Task-Specific Uncertainty Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. Effectively managing this uncertainty is crucial, but the optimal approach varies depending on the specific details of the task: different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions of the environment. For instance, a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precise state estimates in open areas. This varying need for certainty in different parts of the environment, depending on the task, calls for policies that can adapt their uncertainty management strategies based on task-specific requirements. In this paper, we present a framework for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Map (TSUM), which represents acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions of the operating environment for a given task. Using TSUM, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into the robot's decision-making process. We find that conditioning policies on TSUMs provides an effective way to express task-specific uncertainty requirements and enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies without the need for explicit reward engineering to balance task completion and uncertainty management. We evaluate GUIDE on a variety of real-world navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates compared to baselines.
