      <title>BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.</description>

      <title>Contraction waves in pulsating active liquids: From pacemaker to aster dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hydrodynamic theory to examine the emergence of contraction waves in dense active liquids composed of pulsating deformable particles. Our theory couples the liquid density with a chemical phase that determines the periodic deformation of the particles. This mechanochemical coupling regulates the interplay between the flow induced by local deformation, and the resistance to pulsation stemming from steric interaction. We show that this interplay leads the emergent contraction waves to spontaneously organize into a packing of pacemakers. We reveal that the dynamics of these pacemakers is governed by a complex feedback between slow and fast topological defects that form asters in velocity flows. In fact, our defect analysis is a versatile platform for investigating the self-organization of waves in a wide range of contractile systems. Our results shed light on the key mechanisms that control the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids, with relevance for biological systems such as tissues made of confluent pulsating cells.</description>

      <title>Extending Sample Persistence Variable Reduction for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) are challenging to solve due to the exponential growth of the solution space. When tackled with Ising machines, constraints are typically enforced by the penalty function method, whose coefficients must be carefully tuned to balance feasibility and objective quality. Variable-reduction techniques such as sample persistence variable reduction (SPVAR) can mitigate hardware limitations of Ising machines, yet their behavior on CCOPs remains insufficiently understood. Building on our prior proposal, we extend and comprehensively evaluate multi-penalty SPVAR (MP-SPVAR), which fixes variables using solution persistence aggregated across multiple penalty coefficients. Experiments on benchmark problems, including the quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem, demonstrate that MP-SPVAR attains higher feasible-solution ratios while matching or improving approximation ratios relative to the conventional SPVAR algorithm. An examination of low-energy states under small penalties clarifies when feasibility degrades and how encoding choices affect the trade-off between solution quality and feasibility. These results position MP-SPVAR as a practical variable-reduction strategy for CCOPs and lay a foundation for systematic penalty tuning, broader problem classes, and integration with quantum-inspired optimization hardware as well as quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Training the classification capability of large-scale quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of a phase transition ergodicity can be broken. Here, different initial many-body configurations evolve towards one of several fixed points, which are macroscopically distinguishable through an order parameter. This mechanism enables state classification in quantum cellular automata and feed-forward quantum neural networks. We demonstrate that this capability can be efficiently learned from training data even in extremely high-dimensional state spaces. We illustrate this using a quantum cellular automaton that allows binary classification, which is closely connected to the dynamics of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Ising model with local interactions and dissipation. This approach can be generalized beyond binary classification and offers a natural framework for exploring the link between emergent many-body phenomena and the interpretation of data processing capabilities in the context of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Instability of Laughlin FQH liquids into gapless power-law correlated states with continuous exponents in ideal Chern bands: rigorous results from plasma mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of Laughlin's wave-function in ideal Chern bands which can be mapped to generalized zero Landau levels in spatially dependent magnetic fields. By exploiting its exact mapping onto a classical Coulomb gas and leveraging previous results of one-component plasmas in nonuniform neutralizing backgrounds, we demonstrate that the ideal Laughlin wave-function undergoes a phase transition from its well-known fully gapped topologically ordered plasma state into a power-law correlated dielectric state even for the fixed filling of $1/3$, as the magnetic field becomes increasingly more inhomogeneous. This dielectric state is gapless even though it does not spontaneously break translational symmetry. Remarkably, for a fixed filling $\nu=1/m$, the exponent governing density correlations in this state changes continuously as a function of the degree of spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, and can range from $4$ near a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the plasma state, up to $2 m$ in the limit of fields generated by point solenoids.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Emergent topology of optimal networks for synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for some functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet, theoretical and computational tools for identifying such optimal structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit a combination of counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any given node are highly similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These computational findings are matched by a "constructive" theory for optimal networks; a nonlinear differential equation identifies the optimal pairing of nodes for edges, whereas a variational principle prescribes optimal node-strength allocation. The resulting dynamics provably lack the traditional synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system becomes globally phase-locked, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have broad implications for real-world systems including power grids, neuromorphic computing, and coupled oscillator technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and pole skipping in two-dimensional conformal perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze pole skipping in two-dimensional field theories perturbed away from conformality by a relevant deformation. The leading-order correction to the retarded Green's function can be formally computed in conformal perturbation theory, though it results in singular expressions. We suggest a natural interpretation of these expressions and compute the resulting Green's function to leading nontrivial order in the deformation. As a check of our results, we compare the skipped poles we find to the butterfly velocity obtained from a holographic gravitational dual perturbed by a massive scalar field; we find precise agreement. We comment on extensions to subleading order, where agreement with holographic expectations would no longer be expected.</description>

      <title>Chemically Active Liquid Bridges Generate Repulsive Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets help organize cells by compartmentalizing biomolecules and by mediating mechanical interactions. When bridging two structures, such droplets generate capillary forces, which depend on surface properties and distance. While the forces exerted by passive liquid bridges are well understood, the role of active chemical reactions, which are often present in biological droplets, remains unclear. To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.</description>

      <title>Non-Lagrangian phases of matter from Wilsonian renormalization of 3D Wess-Zumino-Witten theory on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the renormalization of D-dimensional level-k Wess-Zumino-Witten theory with Stiefel-manifold target space $\mathrm{St}_{N,N-D-1} \cong \mathrm{SO}(N)/\mathrm{SO}(D+1)$, with a particular focus on $D = 3$. I investigate in particular whether such a theory admits IR-stable fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Such fixed points have been suggested to describe conformal phases of matter that do not have a known dual (super-)renormalizable Lagrangian for $N \geq 7$ in $D = 3$. They are hence of interest both from the point of view of quantum phases of matter as well as pure field theory. The $D$-dimensional expressions enable the computation, by analytic computation, of beta functions in $D = 2 + \epsilon$, at least to first non-trivial order. In $D = 2$, a stable fixed point is found, serving a generalization of the famed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory; it annihilates in $D = 2 + \epsilon$ with an unstable fixed point which splits off from the Gaussian one for $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Although the story is thus qualitatively similar to that of SO(5) deconfined (pseudo-)criticality, for $N \geqslant 6$, the annihilation appears to occur only for $\epsilon &gt; 1$, suggesting the existence of a stable phase in $D = 3$. Comparisons of the scaling dimension of the lowest singlet operator are made with known results for $N = 6$, which is dual to QED$_3$ with $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ fermion flavors. The predictions for the $N = 7$ Stiefel liquid represent to my knowledge the first computation of this kind for a Wess-Zumino-Witten theory without a known gauge theory dual.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$, a $1+1$-dimensional confining gauge theory with fundamental scalar quarks, whose meson spectrum is governed by a Bethe-Salpeter equation structurally parallel to the 't Hooft equation. Exploiting this structural analogy, we develop a nonperturbative analytic framework, based on integrability and inspired by the Fateev-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov (FLZ) method, originally devised for the 't Hooft model and later extended in our previous works. Notably, the same Bethe-Salpeter equation also arises in the description of interchain mesons in the doubled Ising model coupled via a spin-spin interaction term. Within the FLZ approach, we find spectral sums and derive a systematic large-$n$ WKB expansion for the meson spectrum. The analytic results reproduce the expected behavior in key asymptotic regimes, such as the near-critical limit $m\to g/\sqrt{\pi}$ and the heavy-quark regime $m\gg g$, and are in good agreement with numerical data. Finally, by analytically continuing the mass parameter into the complex plane, we uncover two infinite families of singularities where individual mesons become massless, suggesting a hidden connection to nontrivial Conformal Field Theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider active Brownian particles that intermittently switch between active and inactive states. Such behavior is ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to animals and in artificial active systems. We derive exact expressions for key transport properties, including velocity autocorrelations and diffusion coefficients, and demonstrate that particle dispersion is highly sensitive to minute details, such as whether the memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. Extending the model to include minimal metabolic dynamics, we show that the average survival time of the particle is maximized at (i)~an optimal stopping frequency and (ii)~a non-trivial optimal diffusivity, which itself depends on the stopping frequency.</description>

      <title>Mixed-wet percolation on a dual square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a percolation model that is inspired by recent works on immiscible two-phase flow in a mixed-wet porous medium made of a mixture of grains with two different wettability properties. The percolation model is constructed on a dual lattice where the sites on the primal lattice represent the grains of the porous medium, and the bonds on the dual lattice represent the pores in between the grains. The bonds on the dual lattice are occupied based on the two adjacent sites on the primal lattice, which represent the pores where the capillary forces average to zero. The spanning cluster of the bonds, therefore, represents the flow network through which the two immiscible fluids can flow without facing any capillary barrier. It turns out to be a percolation transition of the perimeters of a site percolation problem. We study the geometrical properties at the criticality of the perimeter system numerically. A scaling theory is developed for these properties, and their scaling relations with the respective density parameters are studied. We also verified their finite-size scaling relations. Though the site clusters and their perimeters look very different compared to ordinary percolation, the singular behaviour of the associated geometrical properties remains unchanged. The critical exponents are found to be those of the ordinary percolation.</description>

      <title>Chiral order emergence driven by quenched disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched disorder can destroy magnetic order, for example when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional Ising model. Even when an order exists in the presence of quenched disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order emerges, driven by quenched disorder. This order has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. This type of \textit{order by disorder} differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with site dilution. After analyzing the effect of a few vacancies on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the absence of vacancies.</description>

Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'&gt;t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties shows that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. The fractal phase also appears in a narrow region along the boundary between the delocalized and localized phases. An analysis of the projected wavepacket dynamics in the subsystem shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, the narrow fractal phase shows a super- to subdiffusive behavior as we go from the delocalized to localized phase. When $t'&lt;t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also an anomalous crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Beyond the ballistic phase observed at low $V$, we also identify a superdiffusive regime emerging in the limit $t'/V \ll 1$, which continuously approaches the ballistic behavior as $t' \to 0$. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} (GAA) model.</description>

      <title>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis and Social Networks</title>

Abstract: In 1955 Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou performed first numerical studies with the aim to obtain the thermalization in a chain of nonlinear oscillators from dynamical equations of motion. This model happend to have several specific features and the dynamical thermalization was established only later in other studies. In this work we study more generic models based on Random Matrix Theory and social networks with a nonlinear perturbation leading to dynamical thermalization above a certain chaos border. These systems have two integrals of motion being total energy and norm so that the theoretical Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution depends on temperature and chemical potential. We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the society wealth is associated with energy in the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. At relatively small values of total wealth or energy there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in physical systems such as multimode optical fibers. This condensation leads to a huge fraction of poor households at low wealth and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of companies at Stock Exchange of New York SE (NYSE), London and Hong Kong. It is also shown that above a chaos border the dynamical Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization takes place also in social networks with the Lorenz curves being similar to those of wealth distribution in world countries. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact large deviations and emergent long-range correlations in sequential quantum East circuits</title>

Abstract: Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpi\'nski triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation for the systems with inhomogeneous distribution of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate). In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of stochastic quantization. The difference between stochastic quantization and the present approach is that the former is well defined only for Euclidean field theories, while the latter allows to sample the causal structure of space-time. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a 1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda\ll1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this microcanonical ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a canonical-like one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi]\propto\exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a classical mechanical oscillator coupled to the simplest quantum system, a single qubit. The qubit's influence manifests as deterministic and stochastic forces, highly dependent on its initial quantum state, imprinting unique measurable quantum-induced signatures onto the oscillator's response. The present results suggest a pathway to quantum state reconstruction through classical noise spectroscopy, with potential applications to mesoscopic optomechanical experiments, quantum metrology, and tabletop tests of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</description>
