      <title>IMC-PINN-FE: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Patient-Specific Left Ventricular Finite Element Modeling with Image Motion Consistency and Biomechanical Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However, conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC) with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics. Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to 0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.</description>

      <title>One Giant Leap for Womankind: First Menstrual Cups Tested in Space Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early days of space exploration, when Sally Ride was offered 100 tampons for a week-long mission, menstrual medical devices first began to be used in space conditions. Since then, hormonal menstrual suppression has become the preferred method for managing menstruation in space, offering significant advantages. However, this is not an option for astronauts who choose to menstruate. The lack of sustainable menstrual technologies will pose challenges for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, where astronauts may spend years in space. The AstroCup mission represents the first effort to test menstrual cups in spaceflight, evaluating their durability and functionality. Through material integrity tests and functional assessments using a rheological analogue of human blood, we demonstrate the resilience of menstrual cups and discuss their implications for sustainable menstrual management in future lunar and Martian missions.</description>

      <title>Development and in silico imaging trial evaluation of a deep-learning-based transmission-less attenuation compensation method for DaT SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative measures of dopamine transporter (DaT) uptake in caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus derived from DaT-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images are being investigated as biomarkers to diagnose, assess disease status, and track the progression of Parkinsonism. Reliable quantification from DaT-SPECT images requires performing attenuation compensation (AC), typically with a separate X-ray CT scan. Such CT-based AC (CTAC) has multiple challenges, a key one being the non-availability of X-ray CT component on many clinical SPECT systems. Even when a CT is available, the additional CT scan leads to increased radiation dose, costs, and complexity, potential quantification errors due to SPECT-CT misalignment, and higher training and regulatory requirements. To overcome the challenges with the requirement of a CT scan for AC in DaT SPECT, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based transmission-less AC method for DaT-SPECT (DaT-CTLESS). An in silico imaging trial, titled ISIT-DaT, was designed to evaluate the performance of DaT-CTLESS on the regional uptake quantification task. We observed that DaT-CTLESS yielded a significantly higher correlation with CTAC than that between UAC and CTAC on the regional DaT uptake quantification task. Further, DaT-CLTESS had an excellent agreement with CTAC on this task, significantly outperformed UAC in distinguishing patients with normal versus reduced putamen SBR, yielded good generalizability across two scanners, was generally insensitive to intra-regional uptake heterogeneity, demonstrated good repeatability, exhibited robust performance even as the size of the training data was reduced, and generally outperformed the other considered DL methods on the task of quantifying regional uptake across different training dataset sizes. These results provide a strong motivation for further clinical evaluation of DaT-CTLESS.</description>

      <title>Are Ultrathin Stents Optimal for Bifurcation Lesions? Insights from Computational Modelling of Provisional and DK-Crush Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex coronary bifurcation lesions remain challenging in percutaneous coronary intervention, with stent design and deployment strategy influencing clinical outcomes. This study compares the mechanical and hemodynamic performance of the ultrathin-strut Orsiro and thin-strut Xience Sierra stent in Provisional Side Branch (PSB) and Double Kissing Crush (DKC) techniques. We used finite element analyses of bifurcation stent deployment to assess malapposition, ostium clearance, and arterial wall stress for both techniques. Computational fluid dynamics simulations quantified the luminal exposure to low Time-Averaged Endothelial Shear Stress (TAESS below 0.4 Pa) and high shear rates (above 1000 1/s). In PSB, Orsiro showed higher malapposition (13.0% vs 9.6%) but improved SB ostium clearance (77% vs 64%) and lower low-TAESS exposure (30.3% vs 33.6%) compared to Xience. Orsiro also produced higher arterial wall stresses, particularly during kissing balloon inflation. In DKC, differences in malapposition and ostium clearance diminished between stents, though Orsiro retained a hemodynamic advantage with lower low-TAESS (28.2% vs 36.3%).Stent design influenced outcomes more strongly in PSB, where anatomical interaction and platform-specific behavior impacted both structural and hemodynamic results. In DKC, procedural complexity minimized those differences, making the stenting technique the primary performance driver. Nonetheless, Orsiro consistently preserved more favorable flow conditions. These findings highlight the need to match device selection with lesion characteristics in PSB, while in DKC, optimizing procedural steps may have a greater impact than the choice of stent platform.</description>

      <title>Mapping intratumoral heterogeneity through PET-derived washout and deep learning after proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of produced isotopes during proton therapy can be imaged with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to verify dose delivery. However, biological washout, driven by tissue-dependent processes such as perfusion and cellular metabolism, reduces PET signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limits quantitative analysis. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework to improve the estimation of washout parameters in post-proton therapy PET, not only enabling accurate correction for washout effects, but also mapping intratumoral heterogeneity as a surrogate marker of tumor status and treatment response. We trained the models on Monte Carlo-simulated data from eight head-and-neck cancer patients, and tested them on four additional head-and-neck and one liver patient. Each patient was represented by 75 digital twins with distinct tumoral washout dynamics and imaged 15 minutes after treatment, when slow washout components dominate. We also introduced "washed-out" maps, quantifying the contribution of medium and fast washout components to the loss in activity between the end of treatment and the start of PET imaging. Trained models significantly improved resolution and accuracy, reducing average absolute errors by 60% and 28% for washout rate and washed-out maps, respectively. For intratumoral regions as small as 5 mL, errors predominantly fell below thresholds for differentiating vascular status, and the models generalized across anatomical areas and acquisition delays. This study shows the potential of deep learning in post-proton therapy PET to non-invasively map washout kinetics and reveal intratumoral heterogeneity, supporting dose verification, tumor characterization, and treatment personalization.

      <title>An analytical model for gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\sigma$-LEM) to predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that the number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume $V_{\mathrm{NP}} \propto R^{3}$ and that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally distributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as $D_{\text{enh}} = D_{0} \exp(\sigma Z)$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width $\sigma = \sqrt{2 \ln(1 + Kc)}$.
  By assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between survival and dose can be derived for each voxel. Although there is no closed form for the log-normal distribution, averaging over the entire domain using first and second order moments leads to three possible closed forms: a variance-only one, a mixed-term one, where simultaneous hits from enhancement and baseline can occur, and a second-order model, accurate to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{3})$. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration, mid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.
  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results, irradiated with a 100 kVp x-ray beam, taken from a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data, with deviations within acceptable limits, but presents significant changes to the results obtained with the LEM. In particular, results seem to indicate that dose enhancement is mostly $\alpha$-driven. These findings are further developed in the manuscript.
  The theoretical framework presented here collapses radiobiological outcomes to two experimentally controllable variables, beam quality, in the term $K_c$, and intracellular concentration $c$, while retaining mechanistic fidelity. Additional tests should be made to further confirm the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>A unipolar head gradient for high-field MRI without encoding ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: MRI gradients with a conventional, bipolar design generally face a trade-off between performance, encoding ambiguity, and circumventing the latter by means of RF selectivity. This problem is particularly limiting in cutting-edge brain imaging performed at field strengths &gt;= 7T and using high-performance head gradients. Methods: To address this issue, the present work proposes to fundamentally eliminate the encoding ambiguity in head gradients by using a unipolar z-gradient design that takes advantage of the signal-free range on one side of the imaging volume. This concept is demonstrated by implementation of a unipolar head gradient for operation at 7T. Results: Imaging in phantoms and in vivo demonstrates elimination of backfolding due to encoding ambiguity. At the same time, the unipolar design achieves efficiency on par with conventional bipolar design, resulting in high amplitude and slew-rate performance. Conclusion: The prospect of gradient systems based on a unipolar design holds promise for all advanced neuroimaging that demands high gradient performance. It will make the greatest difference at 7T and beyond where the absence of ambiguity removes a key concern and constraint in terms of RF behaviour and instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 2. Phase-contrast tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, quantitative aspects of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging (PBI) were investigated using theoretical and numerical approaches, as well as experimental two-dimensional PBI images collected with plane monochromatic X-rays at a synchrotron beamline. In this second part, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution and contrast are studied in connection with the radiation dose in three-dimensional PBI images of breast tissue samples obtained using propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PB-CT) with energy-integrating and photon-counting detectors. The analysis is based on the theory of PBI and PB-CT using the homogeneous Transport of Intensity equation (Paganin's method). A biomedical image quality characteristic, suitable for quantitative assessment of X-ray images of biological samples, is introduced and applied. The key factors leading to high values of the biomedical imaging quality in PBI and to relatively low values of the same quality metric in CT imaging are identified and discussed in detail. This study is aimed primarily at developing tools for quantitative assessment and optimization of medical PB-CT imaging, initially at synchrotron facilities, with the prospect of subsequent transfer of the technology to medical clinics.</description>

      <title>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.</description>
