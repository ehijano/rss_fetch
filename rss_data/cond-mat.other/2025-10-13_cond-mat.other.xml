      <title>Accelerated prediction of dielectric functions in solar cell materials with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) model for predicting dielectric functions directly from crystal structures. Trained on $\sim$7000 dielectric functions from the JARVIS-DFT database computed with a meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional, the model accurately reproduces spectral features, including peak intensities and overall line shapes, while enabling efficient high-throughput screening. Applied to the recently developed Alexandria materials database, containing over four hundred thousand insulating materials, we uncover a clear elemental trend, with vanadium emerging as a strong indicator of materials with high-spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME). In particular, vanadium-based perovskite materials show a substantially higher fraction of high-SLME compounds compared to the database average, underscoring their promise for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Hubbard-like Interactions and Emergent Dynamical Regimes Between Modulational Instability and Self-Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U &gt; 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone, and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic phases in the Kitaev candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a rich anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a previously proposed cobaltate Kitaev candidate, based on field- and temperature-dependent magnetization, specific heat, and magnetocaloric effect studies. At low temperatures, our experiments uncover a low-lying $j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ state with an antiferromagnetic ground state and pronounced in-plane versus out-of-plane anisotropy. The experimentally identified magnetic phases are theoretically characterized through classical Monte Carlo simulations within an extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model with additional ring exchange interactions. The resulting phase diagram reveals a variety of exotic field-induced magnetic phases, including double-$\textbf{q}$, $\frac{1}{3}$-AFM, zigzag, and vortex phases.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility and ferrotoroidicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of spintronics. Compared with diluted magnetic semiconductors, intrinsic room-temperature magnetic semiconductors have rarely been developed. Reported herein is a magnetic semiconductor film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. The electrical measurements show that the film exhibits typical p-type semiconductor characteristics with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2V-1s-1, which can help achieve an excellent match with the n-type semiconductor. The room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility can be attributed to the formation of ferrotoroidicity and the highly ordered transport channel. This work paves the way for the application of ferrotoroidic materials in sensing, information storage as well as flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Denjoy's anachronistic topological viewpoint on Aubry transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free discrete time crystals (DTCs) in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time first grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and is then saturated, which depends on the energy density of the initial state. Since thermalization of the effective Hamiltonian is slow, there is no typical prethermalization and PDTCs in the Floquet system before final thermalization. The robustness of DTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order</description>
