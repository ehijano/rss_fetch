      <title>The modified Camassa-Holm equation on the half line: a Riemann--Hilbert approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value (IBV) problem for the modified Camassa--Holm (mCH) equation $
\tilde m_t+\left((\tilde u^2-\tilde u_x^2+2\tilde u)\tilde m\right)_x = 0$, $\tilde m:=\tilde u-\tilde u_{xx}+1$ on the half line
  $x \ge 0$. We provide a characterization of the solution of the IBV
  problem in terms of the solution of a matrix Riemann--Hilbert (RH) factorization
  problem in the complex plane of the spectral parameter. The data of this RH problem
  are determined in terms of spectral functions associated with the initial and boundary values
  of the solution, whose compatibility is characterized in spectral terms.</description>

      <title>Blow-up suppression of the Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the use of Taylor-Couette flow in extracorporeal circulation devices [K$\ddot{\rm o}$rfer et al., 2003, 26(4): 331-338], where it leads to an accumulation of platelets and plasma proteins in the vortex center and therefore to a decreased probability of contact between platelets and material surfaces and its protein adsorption per square unit is significantly lower than laminar flow. Increased platelet adhesion or protein adsorption on the device surface can induce platelet aggregation or thrombosis, which is analogous to the ``blow-up phenomenon" in mathematical modeling. Here we mathematically analyze this stability mechanism and demonstrate that sufficiently strong flow can prevent blow-up from occurring. In details, we investigate the two-dimensional Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system in an annular domain around a Taylor-Couette flow $U(r,\theta)=A\big(r+\frac{1}{r} \big)(-\sin\theta, \cos\theta)^{T}$ with $(r,\theta)\in[1,R]\times\mathbb{S}^{1}$, and prove that the solutions are globally bounded without any smallness restriction on the initial cell mass or velocity when $A$ is large.</description>

      <title>Green functions, Hitchin's formula and curvature equations on tori II: Rectangular torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G(z)$ be the Green function on the flat torus $E_{\tau}=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau)$ with the singularity at $0$. Lin and Wang (Ann. Math. 2010) proved that $G(z)$ has either $3$ or $5$ critical points (depending on the choice of $\tau$). Here we study the sum of two Green functions which can be reduced to $G_p(z):=\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$. In Part I \cite{CFL}, we proved that for any $p$ satisfying $p\neq -p$ in $E_{\tau}$, the number of critical points of $G_p(z)$ belongs to $\{4,6,8,10\}$ (depending on the choice of $(\tau, p)$) and each number really occurs.
  In the Part II of this series, we study the important case $\tau=ib$ with $b&gt;0$, i.e. $E_{\tau}$ is a rectangular torus. By developing a completely different approach from Part I, we show the existence of $8$ real values $d_1&lt;d_2&lt;\cdots&lt;d_7&lt;d_8$ such that if $$\wp(p)\in (-\infty, d_1]\cup [d_2, d_3]\cup [d_4, d_5]\cup [d_6, d_7]\cup [d_8,+\infty),$$ then $G_p(z)$ has no nontrivial critical points; if $$\wp(p)\in (d_1, d_2)\cup (d_3, d_4)\cup (d_5, d_6)\cup (d_7, d_8),$$ then $G_p(z)$ has a unique pair of nontrivial critical points that are always non-degenerate saddle points. This allows us to study the possible distribution of the numbers of critical points of $G_p(z)$ for generic $p$. Applications to the Painlev\'{e} VI equation and the curvature equation are also given.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure related to a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a Leray's weak solution to the Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem enjoys a partial regularity which is known in the literature as the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure of a Leray's weak solution. As well, this result has been extended by some authors to the case of the IBVP. In this note, we achieve the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure by means of a new proof. Our proof is based on a priori estimates for a suitable approximating sequence. In this way our result covers a more general setting in the sense that, e.g., we can also include the case of the weak solutions furnished by Hopf for an IBVP in bounded domains without requiring an energy inequality in a strong form, but just employing a priori estimates on the Galerkin approximation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Rupture Solutions for the Elliptic MEMS Equation with H\'enon-Type Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an elliptic MEMS equation with H\'enon-type term, $\Delta u = \lambda |x|^{\alpha}/u^{p} + F$, we study rupture solutions, i.e. solutions for which $u(x_0)=0$ at some point $x_0$, also $x_0$ is called a rupture point. In this paper we focus on the special case where the rupture occurs at the origin. According to the different H\'enon-type exponents $\alpha$, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of such solutions near the origin and derive a full asymptotic expansion of arbitrary order in a neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, for both radial solutions and non-radial solutions with asymptotic radial condition, we prove the existence of rupture solutions near the rupture point by constructing it.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation from bubbles in nonconvex cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Neumann problem for the critical semilinear elliptic equation in cones. The standard bubble provides a family of radial solutions, which are known to be the only positive solutions in convex cones. For nonconvex cones, symmetry breaking may occur and the symmetry breaking is related to the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the domain $D\subset\S^{N-1}$, that spans the cone. We construct a one-parameter family of domains on the sphere whose first eigenvalue crosses the threshold at which the bubble loses stability. Under the assumption that this eigenvalue is simple, we prove, via the Crandall Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, the existence of a branch of nonradial solutions bifurcating from the standard bubble. Moreover we show that the bifurcation is global.</description>

      <title>On the formation of microstructure and the occurrence of vortices in a singularly perturbed energy related to helimagnetism: a scaling law result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, singularly perturbed energies arising from discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-models are studied. The energies under consideration consist of a non-convex bulk term and a higher-order regularizing term and are subject to incompatible boundary conditions. In contrast to existing results in the literature, in this work, admissible fields are not necessarily gradient fields, instead their curl is linked to topological singularities, so-called vortices, in the discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-model. The main result of this work is a scaling law for the minimal energy with respect to three parameters: one measuring the incompatibility of the boundary conditions, the second measuring the strength of the regularizing term, and the third being related to the interatomic distance in the discrete model. The shown result implies in particular that in certain parameter regimes, minimizers necessarily develop vortices. A key tool in the analysis is a careful modification of the celebrated ball-construction technique that, due to a lack of rigidity, considers simultaneously both the bulk energy and the regularizing term.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Fisher information in non-convex domains: one chain to rule them all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the (square root) Fisher information functional is a strong Wasserstein upper gradient of the entropy on non-convex Riemannian domains. This fills a gap in the literature by allowing one to completely dispense from $\lambda$-displacement convexity arguments. Along the way we establish a novel quantitative short-time control of the Fisher information along the Neumann heat flow, and establish an exact chain rule under stronger $AC_2$ assumptions typically satisfied by curves of measures obtained as limits of JKO schemes.</description>

      <title>Higher-order diffusion and Cahn-Hilliard-type models revisited on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve explicitly and analyze rigorously inhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems (IBVP) for several fourth-order variations of the traditional diffusion equation and the associated linearized Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) model (also Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), formulated in the spatiotemporal quarter-plane. Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of (1+2)-dimensional linear partial differential of Asian options pricing. Special cases have been used to models of financial mathematics. We carry out group classification of a class equations. In particular, the maximum dimension Lie invariance algebra within the above class is eight-dimensional. It is shown that an equation with such an algebra can be transformed into the linear Kolmogorov equation with the help of the point transformations of variables. Using the operators of invariance algebra symmetry reduction is carried out and invariant exact solutions are constructed for some equations.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp gradient estimate for the natural Green's function of a closed manifold with positive Ricci curvature. We also show that this estimate is closely related to a family of monotonicity formulae. These results extend those previously obtained by Colding and Minicozzi for open manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We further obtain several geometric applications, including a new proof of Bishop's volume comparison theorem in dimension four.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.</description>

      <title>Two-phase averaged system justification for ideal gases without conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns the mathematical justification of an averaged system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of a two-phase mixture of compressible ideal fluids, with viscosity and without conductivity, in space dimension 1 with periodic boundary conditions. The derivation is done by some homogenization procedure. The originality and the difficulty of the paper consists in the fact that both the density and temperature are allowed to oscillate (because of the absence of heat conduction), so that the limiting model is a six-equations, two-pressures, two-temperatures model. The key point is to show the strong convergence of the stress tensor in $\(L^2((0,T)\times (0, 1))\)$. The main difficulties are to obtain uniform estimates in spite of the presence of oscillating coefficients in the energy equation. It requires to look at solutions with low regularity for the density and the temperature.</description>

      <title>Another look at quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with prescribed mass via dual method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07346v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=h(u)+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N$, under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a,$ where $N\geq2$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $h$ is a nonlinear reaction term with some suitable conditions. By employing a suitable transformation $u=f(v)$, we reformulate the original problem into the equivalent form $-\Delta v =h(f(v))f'(v)+\lambda f(v)f'(v),\,\, x\in\R^N,$ with prescribed mass $ \int_{\R^N}|f(v)|^2\text{d}x=a. $ To address the challenge posed by the $L^2$-norm $\|f(v)\|^2_2$ not necessarily equaling
  $a$, we introduce a novel stretching mapping: $ v_t(x):=f^{-1}(t^{N/2}f(v(tx))). $ This construction, combined with a dual method and detailed analytical techniques, enables us to establish the following existence results:
  (1)Existence of solutions via constrained minimization using dual methods;
  (2) Existence of ground state normalized solutions under general
  $L^2$-supercritical growth conditions, along with nonexistence results, analyzed via dual methods;
  (3)Existence of normalized solutions under critical growth conditions, treated via dual methods.
  Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy obtained in {\bf(P2)}. Our results extend and refine those of Colin-Jeanjean-Squassina [Nonlinearity 20: 1353-1385, 2010], of Jeanjean-Luo-Wang [J. Differ. Equ. 259: 3894-3928, 2015], of Li-Zou [Pacific J. Math. 322: 99-138, 2023], of Zhang-Li-Wang [Topol. Math. Nonl. Anal. 61: 465-489, 2023] and so on. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of normalized solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations via the dual method.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces for the Laplacian on rough domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Laplace operator on domains subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these operators admit a bounded $H^{\infty}$-functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces, where the weights are powers of the distance to the boundary. Our analysis applies to bounded $C^{1,\lambda}$-domains with $\lambda\in[0,1]$, revealing a crucial trade-off: lower domain regularity can be compensated by enlarging the weight exponent. As a primary consequence, we establish maximal regularity for the corresponding heat equation. This extends the well-posedness theory for parabolic equations to domains with minimal smoothness, where classical methods are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>On an Analytical Criterion for Detecting Intermittent Turbulent Behaviour of Solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A main question in the study of partial differential equations is the following: how do we understand the nature of the solutions and, in particular, how do we determine if a given solution shows turbulent or non-turbulent behaviour? Being able to answer such a question would be a major advance in the comprehension of the nature of turbulence. In this paper we focus on the case of intermittent turbulence and provide an analytical criterion, based on the crest factor, which captures the essential feature of the solutions. By computing the crest factor for the solutions of some classical equations, both linear and nonlinear, we illustrate the capability of the criterion for discerning between solutions exhibiting time-intermittent turbulence behaviour and solutions which either are not turbulent or show statistically stationary turbulence, like, for example, in the case described by Kolmogorov's theory.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Dynamics of the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the results of stabilization for the Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation, a two-dimensional Korteweg--de Vries-type equation. We provide rigorous proofs using two different approaches, showing that when a damping mechanism and an internal delay term (anti-damping) are introduced, the solutions of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation exhibit both local and global exponential stabilization properties. A significant contribution of our work is the determination of the optimal constant and the minimal time required to ensure exponential decay of the energy associated with this two-dimensional system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model Dirichlet problem with concave-convex and critical nonlinearity settled in Carnot groups. Our aim is to prove the existence of two positve solutions in the spirit of a famous result by Ambrosetti, Brezis and Cerami. To this aim we use a variational Perron method combined with proper estimates of a family of functions which are minimizers of the relevant Sobolev inequality. Due to the lack of boundary regularity, we also have to be careful while proving that the first solution found is a local minimizer in the proper topology.</description>

      <title>Optimal cost for the null controllability of the Stokes system with controls having $n-1$ components and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optimal cost of null controllability for the $n$-dimensional Stokes system when the control acts on $n-1$ scalar components. We establish a novel spectral estimate for low frequencies of the Stokes operator, involving solely $n-1$ components, and use it to show that the cost of controllability with controls having $n-1$ components remains of the same order in time as in the case of controls with $n$ components, namely $O(e^{C/T})$, i.e. the cost of null controllability is not affected by the absence of one component of the control. We also give several applications of our results.</description>

Abstract: Given $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and $\rho &gt; 0$, we find solutions $(\lambda,u)$ to the problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \bigl(-\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\bigr)^m u + \lambda G'(u) = F'(u)\\ \int_{\mathbb{R}} K(u) \, \mathrm{d}x = \rho \end{cases} \end{equation*} in the following cases: $m=1$ or $2G(s) = K(s) = s^2$. In the former, we follow a bifurcation argument; in the latter, we use variational methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the practical GADI-HS iteration as a smoother in algebraic multigrid (AMG) method for solving second-order non-selfadjoint elliptic problem. Additionally, we prove the convergence of the derived algorithm and introduce a data-driven parameter learing method called Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict optimal parameters. Numerical experimental results show that using GPR to predict parameters can save a significant amount of time cost and approach the optimal parameters accurately.</description>

      <title>Discrete Superconvergence Analysis for Quantum Magnus Algorithms of Unbounded Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various applications, unbounded Hamiltonian simulation has recently garnered great attention. Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both. This approach may have broader applications in numerical analysis beyond the specific context of this work.</description>

      <title>Adapting Noise to Data: Generative Flows from 1D Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.</description>
