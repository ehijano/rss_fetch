      <title>Personalized Content Moderation and Emergent Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have implemented automated content moderation tools to preserve community norms and mitigate online hate and harassment. Recently, these platforms have started to offer Personalized Content Moderation (PCM), granting users control over moderation settings or aligning algorithms with individual user preferences. While PCM addresses the limitations of the one-size-fits-all approach and enhances user experiences, it may also impact emergent outcomes on social media platforms. Our study reveals that PCM leads to asymmetric information loss (AIL), potentially impeding the development of a shared understanding among users, crucial for healthy community dynamics. We further demonstrate that PCM tools could foster the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, resulting in increased community polarization. Our research is the first to identify AIL as a consequence of PCM and to highlight its potential negative impacts on online communities.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Hypergraphs using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial problem over graphs whose goal is to find the set of nodes in a network that spreads influence at most. Among the various methods for solving the IM problem, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been shown to be particularly effective. While the literature on the topic is particularly ample, only a few attempts have been made at solving the IM problem over higher-order networks, namely extensions of standard graphs that can capture interactions that involve more than two nodes. Hypergraphs are a valuable tool for modeling complex interaction networks in various domains; however, they require rethinking of several graph-based problems, including IM. In this work, we propose a multi-objective EA for the IM problem over hypergraphs that leverages smart initialization and hypergraph-aware mutation. While the existing methods rely on greedy or heuristic methods, to our best knowledge this is the first attempt at applying EAs to this problem. Our results over nine real-world datasets and three propagation models, compared with five baseline algorithms, reveal that our method achieves in most cases state-of-the-art results in terms of hypervolume and solution diversity.</description>

      <title>Words as Trigger Points in Social Media Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigger points are a concept introduced by Mau, Lux, and Westheuser (2023) to study qualitative focus group interviews and understand polarisation in Germany. When people communicate, trigger points represent moments when individuals feel that their understanding of what is fair, normal, or appropriate in society is questioned. In the original studies, individuals react affectively to such triggers and show strong and negative emotional responses. In this paper, we introduce the first systematic study of the large-scale effect of individual words as trigger points by analysing a large amount of social media posts. We examine online deliberations on Reddit between 2020 and 2022 and collect &gt;100 million posts from subreddits related to a set of words identified as trigger points in UK politics. We find that such trigger words affect user engagement and have noticeable consequences on animosity in online discussions. We share empirical evidence of trigger words causing animosity, and how they provide incentives for hate speech, adversarial debates, and disagreements. Our work is the first to introduce trigger points to computational studies of online communication. Our findings are relevant to researchers interested in online harms and who examine how citizens debate politics and society in light of affective polarisation.</description>

      <title>iDRAMA-Scored-2024: A Dataset of the Scored Social Media Platform from 2020 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online web communities often face bans for violating platform policies, encouraging their migration to alternative platforms. This migration, however, can result in increased toxicity and unforeseen consequences on the new platform. In recent years, researchers have collected data from many alternative platforms, indicating coordinated efforts leading to offline events, conspiracy movements, hate speech propagation, and harassment. Thus, it becomes crucial to characterize and understand these alternative platforms. To advance research in this direction, we collect and release a large-scale dataset from Scored -- an alternative Reddit platform that sheltered banned fringe communities, for example, c/TheDonald (a prominent right-wing community) and c/GreatAwakening (a conspiratorial community). Over four years, we collected approximately 57M posts from Scored, with at least 58 communities identified as migrating from Reddit and over 950 communities created since the platform's inception. Furthermore, we provide sentence embeddings of all posts in our dataset, generated through a state-of-the-art model, to further advance the field in characterizing the discussions within these communities. We aim to provide these resources to facilitate their investigations without the need for extensive data collection and processing efforts.</description>

      <title>CDRNP: Cross-Domain Recommendation to Cold-Start Users via Neural Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to tackle the user cold-start problem, which aims to make recommendations for users in the target domain by transferring the user preference derived from the source domain. Traditional CDR studies follow the embedding and mapping (EMCDR) paradigm, which transfers user representations from the source to target domain by learning a user-shared mapping function, neglecting the user-specific preference. Recent CDR studies attempt to learn user-specific mapping functions in meta-learning paradigm, which regards each user's CDR as an individual task, but neglects the preference correlations among users, limiting the beneficial information for user representations. Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios.</description>
