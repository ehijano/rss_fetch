      <title>Difference-in-Differences Estimators for Treatments Continuously Distributed at Every Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose difference-in-differences estimators in designs where the treatment is continuously distributed at every period, as is often the case when one studies the effects of taxes, tariffs, or prices. We assume that between consecutive periods, the treatment of some units, the switchers, changes, while the treatment of other units remains constant. We show that under a placebo-testable parallel-trends assumption, averages of the slopes of switchers' potential outcomes can be nonparametrically estimated. We generalize our estimators to the instrumental-variable case. We use our estimators to estimate the price-elasticity of gasoline consumption.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Bounds under Sample Selection with an Application to the Effects of Social Media on Political Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04329v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for estimation and inference for bounds for heterogeneous causal effect parameters in general sample selection models where the treatment can affect whether an outcome is observed and no exclusion restrictions are available. The method provides conditional effect bounds as functions of policy relevant pre-treatment variables. It allows for conducting valid statistical inference on the unidentified conditional effects. We use a flexible debiased/double machine learning approach that can accommodate non-linear functional forms and high-dimensional confounders. Easily verifiable high-level conditions for estimation, misspecification robust confidence intervals, and uniform confidence bands are provided as well. We re-analyze data from a large scale field experiment on Facebook on counter-attitudinal news subscription with attrition. Our method yields substantially tighter effect bounds compared to conventional methods and suggests depolarization effects for younger users.</description>

      <title>Two-way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences Estimators in Heterogeneous Adoption Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation under a parallel trends assumption, in designs where no unit is treated at period one, all units receive a strictly positive dose at period two, and the dose varies across units. There are therefore no true control groups in such cases. First, we develop a test of the assumption that the treatment effect is mean independent of the treatment, under which the commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects estimator is consistent. When this test is rejected or lacks power, we propose alternative estimators, robust to heterogeneous effects. If there are units with a period-two treatment arbitrarily close to zero, the robust estimator is a difference-in-difference using units with a period-two treatment below a bandwidth as controls. Without such units, we propose non-parametric bounds, and an estimator relying on a parametric specification of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We use our results to revisit Pierce and Schott (2016) and Enikolopov et al. (2011).</description>
