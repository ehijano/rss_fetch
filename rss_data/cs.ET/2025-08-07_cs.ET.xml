      <title>Injection Locking and Coupling Dynamics in Superconducting Nanowire based Cryogenic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillators designed to function at cryogenic temperatures play a critical role in superconducting electronics and quantum computing by providing stable, low noise signals with minimal energy loss.Here we present a comprehensive numerical study of injection locking and mutual coupling dynamics in superconducting nanowire based cryogenic oscillators.Using the design space of standalone ScNW based oscillator, we investigate two critical mechanisms that govern frequency synchronization and signal coordination in cryogenic computing architectures.First, an injection locking induced by an external AC signal with a frequency near the oscillators natural frequency, and second, the mutual coupling dynamics between two ScNW oscillators under varying coupling strengths.We identify key design parameters such as shunt resistance, nanowire inductance, and coupling strength that govern the locking range.Additionally, we examine how the amplitude of the injected signal affects the amplitude of the locked oscillation, offering valuable insights for power aware oscillator synchronization.Furthermore, we analyze mutual synchronization between coupled ScNW oscillators using capacitive and resistive coupling elements.Our results reveal that the phase difference between oscillators can be precisely controlled by tuning the coupling strength, enabling programmable phase encoded information processing.These findings could enable building ScNW based oscillatory neural networks, synchronized cryogenic logic blocks, and on chip cryogenic resonator arrays.</description>

      <title>Wave Computing based on Dynamical Networks: Applications in Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a computing framework that leverages wave propagation within an interconnected network, where nodes and edges possess wave manipulation capabilities, such as frequency mixing or time delay. This computing paradigm can not only achieve intrinsic parallelism like existing works by the exploration of an exponential number of possibilities simultaneously with very small number of hardware units, but also extend this unique characteristic to a multidimensional space including spatial, temporal and frequency domains, making it particularly effective for addressing NP-hard problems. The proposed architecture has been validated through SPICE simulations, demonstrating its potential capability in solving several NP-hard problems, such as the Number Partitioning Problem, the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, and the Traveling Salesman Problem.</description>

      <title>QFOR: A Fidelity-aware Orchestrator for Quantum Computing Environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cloud computing enables remote access to quantum processors, yet the heterogeneity and noise of available quantum hardware create significant challenges for efficient resource orchestration. These issues complicate the optimization of quantum task allocation and scheduling, as existing heuristic methods fall short in adapting to dynamic conditions or effectively balancing execution fidelity and time. Here, we propose QFOR, a Quantum Fidelity-aware Orchestration of tasks across heterogeneous quantum nodes in cloud-based environments using Deep Reinforcement learning. We model the quantum task orchestration as a Markov Decision Process and employ the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to learn adaptive scheduling policies, using IBM quantum processor calibration data for noise-aware performance estimation. Our configurable framework balances overall quantum task execution fidelity and time, enabling adaptation to different operational priorities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that QFOR is adaptive and achieves significant performance with 29.5-84% improvements in relative fidelity performance over heuristic baselines. Furthermore, it maintains comparable quantum execution times, contributing to cost-efficient use of quantum computation resources.</description>

      <title>Salt-Rock Creep Deformation Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks and Analytical Models for Subsurface Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data. Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a 15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models, effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.</description>

      <title>RACE-IT: A Reconfigurable Analog Computing Engine for In-Memory Transformer Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models represent the cutting edge of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and excel in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, processing these models demands significant computational resources and results in a substantial memory footprint. While In-memory Computing (IMC)offers promise for accelerating Vector-Matrix Multiplications(VMMs) with high computational parallelism and minimal data movement, employing it for other crucial DNN operators remains a formidable task. This challenge is exacerbated by the extensive use of complex activation functions, Softmax, and data-dependent matrix multiplications (DMMuls) within Transformer models. To address this challenge, we introduce a Reconfigurable Analog Computing Engine (RACE) by enhancing Analog Content Addressable Memories (ACAMs) to support broader operations. Based on the RACE, we propose the RACE-IT accelerator (meaning RACE for In-memory Transformers) to enable efficient analog-domain execution of all core operations of Transformer models. Given the flexibility of our proposed RACE in supporting arbitrary computations, RACE-IT is well-suited for adapting to emerging and non-traditional DNN architectures without requiring hardware modifications. We compare RACE-IT with various accelerators. Results show that RACE-IT increases performance by 453x and 15x, and reduces energy by 354x and 122x over the state-of-the-art GPUs and existing Transformer-specific IMC accelerators, respectively.</description>

      <title>WeatherEdit: Controllable Weather Editing with 4D Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

      <title>Neuromorphic Cybersecurity with Semi-supervised Lifelong Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.</description>
