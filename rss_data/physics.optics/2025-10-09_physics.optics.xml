      <title>Strong interlayer coupling and chiral flat-band cascades in twisted bilayer gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Airy Resonances in Photonic Crystal Superpotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airy wavefunctions are associated with one of the simplest scenarios in wave mechanics: a quantum bouncing ball. In other words, they are the eigenstates of the time-independent Schrodinger equation with a linear potential. In the domain of optics, laser beams that are spatially shaped as Airy functions (`Airy beams') have been shown to exhibit a prominent lobe that follows a curved path, rather than propagating in a straight line, and which has self-healing properties in the presence of obstacles. Here, we observe the presence of Airy resonances in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a lattice of holes in a silicon slab. Analogously to electrons in a linear potential, these Airy resonances arise due to a linear spatial variation in the lattice constant of the holes. We map the electromagnetic description of the photonic crystal onto a 2D non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation with a linear potential, which we call a `superpotential'. The non-Hermiticity appears in the form of a complex effective mass due to out-of-plane radiation and fundamentally alters the collective optical response of the Airy resonances.</description>

      <title>High-Q and Compact Fabry-Perot Microresonators on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has played a pivotal role in the advancement of integrated photonics, by supporting a diverse range of applications including nonlinear optics, electro-optics, and piezo-optomechanics. The effective realization and enhancement of these interactions rely heavily on the implementation of high quality photonic microresonators. The pursuit of novel resonator architectures with optimized properties thus represents a central research area in TFLN photonics. In this work, we design and fabricate TFLN Fabry-Perot microresonators, by placing a straight section of waveguide between a pair of tapered photonic crystal mirrors. The resonator features a high quality factor of 600k at 1530 nm and a compact length of 100 um. The functionality of the device is further demonstrated by integrating on-chip electrodes for high-frequency piezo-optomechanical modulation. Our device can serve as an appealing candidate for developing high-performance photonic components on the TFLN platform.</description>

      <title>Observation of Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \&amp; $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) are widely used across physics, microscopy, neuroscience, and laser engineering, providing fast, precise, and non-mechanical control of light. While conventional AODs naturally support multiplexing in one and two dimensions, no analogous device has existed for three-dimensional control, leaving a critical gap in rapid focus tuning and 3D beam shaping. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional AOD system capable of multiplexed axial and lateral beam control with high speed and large dynamic range. We achieve this by combining a double-pass AOD with a diffraction grating in the Littrow configuration to realize a compact frequency-tunable lens with multiplexing capability. Our device enables axial scanning over more than twenty Rayleigh ranges with switching rates up to 100 kHz, while simultaneous multi-tone driving produces arbitrary multi-focal beam profiles. By integrating the axial module with lateral deflection, we generate reconfigurable 3D optical patterns. This approach establishes a broadly applicable platform for multiplexed 3D beam control, with potential applications from high-resolution microscopy and laser processing to scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Q chalcogenide micro-racetrack resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality factor microresonators are an attractive platform for the study of nonlinear photonics, with diverse applications in communications, sensing, and quantum metrology. The characterization of loss mechanisms and nonlinear properties in a microresonator is a necessity for the development of photonic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate a high-quality chalcogenide ($Ge_{23}Sb_{7}S_{70}$) micro-racetrack resonator utilizing Euler curves. The racetrack geometry is studied to minimize loss at both the straight-curved waveguide junction and through the waveguide curve. The material absorption, intrinsic quality factor, and nonlinear index are extracted by a comprehensive model fit to laser wavelength resonance scans. The micro-racetrack resonator possesses an absorption loss of $0.43 dB/m$, an intrinsic quality factor of $4.5 \times 10^6$, and nonlinear index of $1.28 \times 10^{-18} m^2/W$, in a waveguide cross-section less than $1 {\mu}m^2$. Our results yield state-of-the-art nonlinear microresonators and establish $Ge_{23}Sb_{7}S_{70}$ as a low-loss PIC platform.</description>

      <title>Twisted bi-layer magnetic photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photonics, twisted bi-layer systems have demonstrated unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, primarily through the modulation of photonic band structures and the formation of Moir\'e patterns. Meanwhile, magnetic photonic crystals have served as cornerstone platforms for manipulating light propagation, facilitating key applications such as Faraday rotation-based isolators and non-reciprocal devices. Nevertheless, the synergistic integration of twist engineering and magneto-optical effects in bi-layer architectures remains unexplored. This work introduces twisted magnetic bi-layer photonic crystal slabs as a novel platform to unify these degrees of freedom. By continuously tuning the twist angle between two magneto-active photonic layers, the giant circular dichroism is observed, and the transmitted waves can be perfectly linearly polarized and rotated. These effects arise from the interplay between resonant properties of the Moir\'e cell and magnetization-dependent coupling of circularly polarized states. This work establishes a foundation for magnetic topological photonics, bridging twistronics and magneto-optics to unlock new mechanisms for dynamic light control in compact and reconfigurable devices.</description>

      <title>Voxel-scale quantum state control in nanorod ensembles using reconfigurable needle beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely addressing single nanostructures inside dense ensembles remains a bottleneck for scalable photonic and quantum information devices. Here we demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited, offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip slow-light components.</description>

      <title>Super resolving binary-source hypothesis testing with a double-clad fiber coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for binary spatial mode demultiplexing, using a double-clad fiber coupler as an optical mode sorter, for hypothesis testing for one or two point sources in an incident optical field. By directly coupling an optical field through a double-clad fiber coupler, we demultiplex the field into the fundamental mode and a superposition of higher-order modes. We use the ratio of multi-mode to single-mode power to distinguish between single and double point sources. In a tabletop demonstration of the technique, we demonstrate the capability to accurately identify the presence of two sources separated below the Rayleigh limit for relative brightnesses from 0 dB to -20 dB. For sources with less than 5 dB difference in their relative powers, our imaging protocol can correctly determine the presence of a second optical source even when the two sources have separations 50x smaller than the Rayleigh limit. These results highlight the potential of this technique as a simple tool for super-resolving classification of a pair of point emitters, especially in the context of astronomical imaging for binary systems.</description>

      <title>Upscaling Tomographic Volumetric 3D Printing via Virtual Stitching of Coordinated Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic volumetric 3D printing offers layer free, rapid fabrication of objects with high design freedom, but is limited to relatively small curing volumes because of the optical constraints imposed by an assumed need for telecentricity. We present a method to virtually stitch multiple projections from different light sources to build a single workpiece. To avoid the built in requirement for telecentricity and thus the need for an index matching vat, projections are produced by a graphics processing unit accelerated raytracing solver. The method accounts for non ideal light propagation, including nontelecentricity, reflection, refraction, attenuation, as well as any output power mismatch among projectors.Tomographic volumetric 3D printing offers layer free, rapid fabrication of objects with high design freedom, but is limited to relatively small curing volumes because of the optical constraints imposed by an assumed need for telecentricity.

      <title>Hot-carrier generation in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Noise-Robust Wavefront Reconstruction with an Optical Vortex Wavefront Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term wavefront sensor refers to the entire class of devices capable of measuring the optical wavefront of the incoming beam. Although numerous solutions have been proposed so far, recent advances in structured light have opened new development possibilities through controlled modification of optical field amplitude and phase. We present an alternative approach to angle-based sensing, introducing optical vortices stable phase singularities within each subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann (S-H) architecture. Rather than changing the fundamental angle-based operating principle, it transforms the tracked quantity and its detection method. The presence of a singularity enables a dedicated tracking algorithm that outperforms conventional methods without increasing computational complexity. We evaluated its performance against the conventional S-H across a broad SNR range (from 2 to 22), corresponding to shot noise limited to high saturation regimes, demonstrating lower mean residual phase variance across all conditions. This work demonstrates that structured beam shaping can extend the capabilities of traditional S-H architectures without requiring fundamental redesign.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of graphene via the saddle point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</description>

      <title>Broadband, robust, and tunable beam splitter based on topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam splitters are pivotal components in integrated microwave and photonic systems. However, conventional designs based on directional coupling or multi-mode interference often suffer from back scattering, frequency-dependent splitting ratios, and limited bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, here, we propose a new physical mechanism to achieve a broadband, robust, and tunable beam splitter by manipulating the mode coupling of the topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons (USMP) at the input and output waveguides. We show that the beam splitter not only exhibits strong robustness against obstacles but also achieves a broad bandwidth across nearly the entire USMP band with arbitrarily tunable and frequency- independent splitting ratios. Moreover, the operating band of the beam splitter can be actively tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field, while its robust and broadband characteristics are retained. Our results extend the research frontier of beam splitters and may have potential applications in integrated photonic devices and modern communication systems.</description>

This study investigates the optical Kerr effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index, reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance, characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement maintaining less than 5\% variation for moderate polarization angles and tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections. Compared to bound states in the continuum (BIC), the non-BIC trapped mode demonstrates superior robustness to structural disorder while achieving comparable nonlinear enhancement. These findings suggest promising applications in reflective nonlinear optics, particularly for high harmonic generation and polarization-insensitive photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Kirigami-based Flexible Metasurface with Reconfigurable Intrinsic Chirality from Zero to Near-unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate on sapphire provides an excellent platform for simultaneously confining acoustic and optical modes without suspended structures, enabling efficient acousto-optic modulation through strong piezoelectric coupling. Here, we identify the challenges in realizing the forward Brillouin interaction at visible wavelengths, and overcome the limitation by introducing a quasi-phase-matching scheme through periodic waveguide width modulation. We predict a complete inter-modal optical conversion over 1.1 mm using only 1 mW acoustic power. Our study paves the way for high-performance visible-wavelength acousto-optic devices on integrated platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Sagnac interferometers in the form of active ring lasers have emerged as unique rotation sensors in the geosciences, where their sensitivity allows to detect geodetic and seismological signals. The passive laser gyroscope variant, however, is still at a stage of development, and adequate laser frequency stabilization techniques are explored to reach the desired levels of sensitivity and stability. Here, we present the first H\"ansch-Couillaud locked passive laser gyroscope. We employ a lock-in scheme to overcome the flicker floor to achieve a sensitivity of \SI{3.1}{\nano\radian/\second}, corresponding to a fraction of \SI{7.7e-5}{} in the Earth's rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Circular Dichroism without absorption in isolated chiral dielectric Mie particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effect phenomenologically analogous to circular dichroism can arise even for dielectric and isotropic chiral spherical particles. By analyzing the polarimetry of light scattered from a chiral, lossless microsphere illuminated with linearly polarized light, we show that the scattered light becomes nearly circularly polarized, exhibiting large, nonresonant values of the Stokes parameter $S_3$ for a broad range of visible frequencies. This phenomenon occurs only in the Mie regime, with the microsphere radius comparable to the wavelength, and provided that the scattered light is collected by a high-NA objective lens, including non-paraxial Fourier components. Altogether, our findings offer a theoretical framework and motivation for an experimental demonstration of a novel chiroptical effect with isolated dielectric particles, with potential applications in enantioselection and characterization of single microparticles, each and every one with its own chiral response.</description>

      <title>SEPhIA: &lt;1 laser/neuron Spiking Electro-Photonic Integrated Multi-Tiled Architecture for Scalable Optical Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into optical spiking neural networks (SNNs) has primarily focused on spiking devices, networks of excitable lasers or numerical modelling of large architectures, often overlooking key constraints such as limited optical power, crosstalk and footprint. We introduce SEPhIA, a photonic-electronic, multi-tiled SNN architecture emphasizing implementation feasibility and realistic scaling. SEPhIA leverages microring resonator modulators (MRMs) and multi-wavelength sources to achieve effective sub-one-laser-per-spiking neuron efficiency. We validate SEPhIA at both device and architecture levels by time-domain co-simulating excitable CMOS-MRR coupled circuits and by devising a physics-aware, trainable optoelectronic SNN model, with both approaches utilizing experimentally derived device parameters. The multi-layer optoelectronic SNN achieves classification accuracies over 90% on a four-class spike-encoded dataset, closely comparable to software models. A design space study further quantifies how photonic device parameters impact SNN performance under constrained signal-to-noise conditions. SEPhIA offers a scalable, expressive, physically grounded solution for neuromorphic photonic computing, capable of addressing spike-encoded tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Far-field radiation of bulk, edge and corner eigenmodes from a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger plasmonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.</description>

      <title>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</description>

      <title>Selective high-order topological states and tunable chiral emission in atomic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic metasurfaces (AMs) provide a powerful nanophotonic platform for integrating topological effects into quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate the quantum optical and topological properties of a two-dimensional Kagome AM, going beyond the tight-binding approximation and incorporating all-to-all interactions. We reveal selective higher-order topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light sources and photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ring laser is defined by its perimeter, which directly enters the conversion factor between measured Sagnac frequency and the actual rotation rate. Large ring lasers employed in geodesy and fundamental physics require stability of the perimeter at or below the parts-per-billion level. We present two complementary approaches to actively control the perimeter length of such ring lasers, reaching a relative length stability of $4\times 10^{-10}$. One of these approaches is based on a phase detection between the beat of two resonances of different longitudinal mode index and a stable local oscillator. The other approach employs a highly stable wavelength meter to measure the absolute frequency of the laser light. These methods can readily be implemented and bring the stability of heterolithic devices on par with monolithic designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully stabilized 1-GHz Yb-fiber laser frequency comb built on silica substrates, utilizing "optical cubes" to house all optical components, ensuring long-term stability and practical operation. Both the femtosecond laser and f-to-2f interferometer are constructed to silica bricks, with a compact footprint of 290 mm * 250 mm, and a total weight of 1.8 kg. This system provides a stable repetition rate, offset frequency, and a supercontinuum spanning 460-1560 nm without requiring amplification. The carrier-envelop offset frequency exhibits exceptional in-loop stability, with a fractional frequency instability of 3.07* 10^(-18) at a 1 second averaging time, improving to 2.12*10^(-20) at a 10,000 second, maintaining uninterrupted operation for over 60 hours. This work demonstrates a high-performance GHz fiber-based frequency comb, paving the way for applications beyond laboratory environments, including dual-comb spectroscopy, astronomical spectrograph calibration, and portable optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Geometric Shifts in Wave Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the {\it phase} of an evolving wave has become fundamental in physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave states. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be applied to a broad range of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time varying media with moving interfaces unlock new ways to manipulate electromagnetic waves. Yet, analytical solutions have been mostly limited to interfaces moving at constant velocity or constant proper acceleration. Here, we present exact scattering solutions for an arbitrarily accelerating interface, derived directly in the laboratory frame through a suitable change of variables. We show that acceleration introduces rich effects that do not occur with uniform motion, including transitions between multiple velocity regimes, multiple scattering events and generalized frequency chirping. We also solve the inverse problem of designing an interface trajectory that produces a desired chirping profile, demonstrating how tailored acceleration can synthesize complex frequency modulations. These results provide a fundamental framework to understand and control wave interactions with accelerated boundaries, opening pathways for advanced applications in space-time signal processing and dynamic pulse shaping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenCAL is a low cost CAL based printing and post processing platform developed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and standard rapid prototyping tools. The system incorporates recent advancements in VAM, including Optical Scattering Tomography (OST), and is designed with modularity to support future technological integration. The post processing systems developed include standardized procedures for solvent based removal of uncured resin and a centrifugal cleaning module for enhanced material recovery.
  To support the continued advancement of this technology, multiple community engagement pathways have been established to foster the collaborative development of the OpenCAL ecosystem. A primary deployment environment for OpenCAL is academic makerspaces, where the system is specifically designed to leverage the rapid prototyping tools typically available in these facilities. OpenCAL not only introduces advanced volumetric additive manufacturing capabilities to makerspaces but also serves as a platform for hands on education in emerging manufacturing technologies, photopolymer science, and computational imaging. By lowering the barriers to entry for volumetric printing research, OpenCAL enables a broader range of students, from undergraduate to graduate levels, to engage directly in experimental research, contribute to the refinement of open source CAL technologies, and participate in interdisciplinary projects spanning materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer science. In doing so, OpenCAL has the potential to significantly expand the technical capabilities of academic makerspaces, transforming them into hubs for next generation manufacturing innovation and research driven learning.</description>

The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping and skin solitons in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic lattices with asymmetric couplings offer rich possibilities for controlling wave localization, through the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect at lattice corners or sides. Incorporating optical nonlinearity fundamentally alters these boundary-localization characteristics. Here we show that in a two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with Kerr nonlinearity, the interplay between self-trapping and directional propagation leads to position dependent amplitude thresholds. Single-site excitations having above a critical amplitude become confined to their initial position, with lower thresholds near the position where the linear eigenmodes are localized and higher thresholds within the lattice's bulk. Additionally, we study the differences of this dynamical interplay, for wider initial excitations, between the focusing and defocusing Kerr-nonlinearity regimes. Lastly, we identify skin soliton solutions in a variety of two-dimensional lattice geometries featuring coupling asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to future cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Quantized decay charges in non-Hermitian networks characterized by directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes-eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks</description>

      <title>An optical centrifuge with zero rotational acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</description>
