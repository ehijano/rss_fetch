      <title>Cognitive Load and Situational Interest in Physics Laboratories: A Comparative Study Across Three Instructional Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how an instructional approach shapes student's cognitive resources and engagement is central to improving undergraduate physics education especially for novice learners. This study examines how three instructional modalities (Inquiry-based, Design-based, and Game-based learning) affect cognitive load and situational interest in physics laboratories for non-STEM majors. Guided by the revised Cognitive Load Theory framework, two experiments were conducted across two physics domains: mechanics and electrical circuits. In each experiment, students completed three laboratory sessions, one in each instructional modality, followed by surveys measuring cognitive load and situational interest. One-way ANOVA analyses revealed significant differences across the three modalities in both experiments. Game-based laboratories consistently yielded the lowest cognitive load and the highest situational interest, while inquiry-based and design-based labs imposed higher cognitive demands, with their relative effects varying by domain. Overall, situational interest exhibited an inverse relationship with cognitive load, suggesting that reduced cognitive demands support greater engagement. These findings emphasize the value of strategically selecting and combining instructional modalities to balance cognitive load and foster meaningful engagement in physics laboratories for novice learners.</description>

      <title>When AI Evaluates Its Own Work: Validating Learner-Initiated, AI-Generated Physics Practice Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now generate physics practice problems in real time, yet the educational value of these items hinges on rapid, reliable post-generation vetting. In this exploratory study, we investigated which automated checks are both technically feasible and pedagogically meaningful when exercises are produced on demand within a chatbot interface. A cohort of 34 introductory-physics students generated and attempted 543 practice problems during exam preparation. Each item was labeled by an expert on a wide range of quality attributes and presented to the learners in pairs to record their preference. We then (i) benchmarked three commodity LLMs as ``judges'' against the expert labels, (ii) quantified which attributes predict student choice via random-forest models, and (iii) triangulated these results with free-form exit surveys. Only a small subset of the original metric items proved necessary to reliably address student preferences either directly or by proxy. The study demonstrates that scalable formative assessment does not require exhaustive scoring: a carefully curated core of structural and learner-visible checks is sufficient to ensure both technical soundness and user appeal. The findings provide a practical blueprint for deploying real-time, AI-generated practice in physics and other quantitative disciplines.</description>

      <title>A portable LED-based diamond magnetometer for outreach and teaching labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a compact, low-cost version of an NV center diamond magnetometer which replaces the standard green laser with a high-power LED. This modification improves safety, reduces cost, and allows the green excitation and red photoluminescence to be viewed directly during demonstrations. The device is simple to assemble and suitable for outreach activities and undergraduate laboratories. We show that it can produce ODMR spectra and respond to nearby magnetic objects, with a sensitivity on the order of 1 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Supplementary material provides details of the construction and suggestions for student investigations to support use in teaching laboratories.</description>

      <title>The meaning of closeness to women and/or LGBTQ+ physicists: a social network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 'Closeness' is well-defined as a quantitative measure of centrality in social network analysis (SNA), but it is not as well defined qualitatively as a description of social relationships. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of 'closeness' as it is defined both implicitly and explicitly in interviews with 100 women and/or LGBTQ+ PhD physicists. The interviews include a social network construction component, and we define a quantitative network parameter that serves as a proxy for closeness, which we examine in relation to attributes of network members. We find that physicists in this sample see trust, relaxed boundaries, reliance, and support as concepts that most directly define closeness in their relationships. Consistent interaction, positive affect, and commonalities are also often present in (and in some cases, defining of) these relationships. From the quantitative analysis, we find that these physicists tend to view family and partners, friends, and professional friends as comprising their closest relationships. These results are consistent with other studies which have sought to define closeness qualitatively, but the prevalence of trust in this dataset in particular suggests that these physicists see the ability to confide as uniquely important in their relationships. We make recommendations to institutions supporting and employing physicists on how to better support gender and sexual minority (GSM) physicists going forward, and we believe these results help us gain a better understanding of how GSM physicists find success in physics despite the barriers they face due to their identities.</description>
