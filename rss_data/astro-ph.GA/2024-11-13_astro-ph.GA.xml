      <title>The Variability Structure Function of the Highest-Luminosity Quasars on Short Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic photometric variability of quasars is known to follow a random-walk phenomenology on emission timescales of months to years. Some high-cadence restframe optical monitoring in the past has hinted at a suppression of variability amplitudes on shorter timescales of a few days or weeks, opening the question of what drives the suppression and how it might scale with quasar properties. Here, we study a few thousand of the highest-luminosity quasars in the sky, mostly in the luminosity range of $L_{\rm bol}=[46.4, 47.3]$ and redshift range of $z=[0.7, 2.4]$. We use a dataset from the NASA/ATLAS facility with nightly cadence, weather permitting, which has been used before to quantify strong regularity in longer-term restframe-UV variability. As we focus on a careful treatment of short timescales across the sample, we find that a linear function is sufficient to describe the UV variability structure function. Although the result can not rule out the existence of breaks in some groups completely, a simpler model is usually favoured under this circumstance. In conclusion, the data is consistent with a single-slope random walk across restframe timescales of $\Delta t=[10, 250]$ days.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. In fact, cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between infall lookback time and log binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites, as well as of the galaxies previously accreted by the Milky Way, which can, for the first time, be compared to cosmological simulations. We find that the infall lookback time vs. binding energy relation found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events, once the simulated MW total mass within 21 kpc is rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses, in good agreement with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this re-scaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them have been accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also find that some cosmological simulations show too dynamically hot sub-halo systems when compared to identified MW substructures, leading to overestimate the impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Star Formation and Feedback Recipes on the Stellar Mass and Interstellar Medium of High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of $\geq 80$ atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a $10^9\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$ halo at $z=6$, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic $z=0$ galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at $z=0$ does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final $z=6$ stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for $&gt;1,000$ high-redshift galaxies are now available.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamics of the stellar component of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy I: observed properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Recently, both the presence of multiple stellar chemo-kinematic components and rotation in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy have been put into question. Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy making use of the best spectroscopic data-set available containing both line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars. Methods. We carry out a detailed, quantitative analysis on the recent spectroscopic data-set from Tolstoy et al. (2023) that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assess whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with different mean metallicity, spatial distribution and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic data-set. Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-populations model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of around 15 km/s in its average l.o.s. velocity (vlos) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a vlos gradient of 4.0 +1.5 -1.5 km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Confirmation of a Massive Protocluster with Two Substructures at $z \simeq 3.1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a Keck and NOEMA spectroscopic survey of 507 galaxies, where we confirm the presence of two massive overdensities at $z = 3.090 - 3.110$ and $z = 3.133 - 3.155$ in the neighborhood of the GOODS-N, each with over a dozen spectroscopically confirmed members. We find that both of these have galaxy overdensities of NIR-detected galaxies of $\delta_{\rm gal, obs} = 6 - 9$ within corrected volumes of $(6 - 7) \times 10^3~{\rm cMpc}^3$. We estimate the properties of the $z = 0$ descendants of these overdensities using a spherical collapse model and find that both should virialize by $z \simeq 0.5 - 0.8$, with total masses of $M_{\rm tot} \simeq (6 - 7) \times 10^{14}~{\rm M}_\odot$. The same spherical collapse calculations, as well as a clustering-of-clusters statistical analysis, suggest a &gt;80% likelihood that the two overdensities will collapse into a single cluster with $M_{\rm tot} = (1.0 - 1.5) \times 10^{15}~{\rm M}_\odot$ by $z \sim 0.1-0.4$. The $z = 3.14$ substructure contains a core of four bright dusty star-forming galaxies with $\Sigma {\rm SFR} = 2700 \pm 700~{\rm M}_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ in a volume of only 280 ${\rm cMpc}^3$.</description>

      <title>PICZL: Image-based Photometric Redshifts for AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering &gt; 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.</description>

      <title>Disk kinematics at high redshift: DysmalPy's extension to 3D modeling and comparison with different approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-resolved emission line kinematics are invaluable to investigating fundamental galaxy properties and have become increasingly accessible for galaxies at $z\gtrsim0.5$ through sensitive near-infrared imaging spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. Kinematic modeling is at the core of the analysis and interpretation of such data sets, which at high-z present challenges due to lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and resolution compared to data of local galaxies. We present and test the 3D fitting functionality of DysmalPy, examining how well it recovers intrinsic disk rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, using a large suite of axisymmetric models, covering a range of galaxy properties and observational parameters typical of $z\sim1$-$3$ star-forming galaxies. We also compare DysmalPy's recovery performance to that of two other commonly used codes, GalPak3D and 3DBarolo, which we use in turn to create additional sets of models to benchmark DysmalPy. Over the ranges of S/N, resolution, mass, and velocity dispersion explored, the rotation velocity is accurately recovered by all tools. The velocity dispersion is recovered well at high S/N, but the impact of methodology differences is more apparent. In particular, template differences for parametric tools and S/N sensitivity for the non-parametric tool can lead to differences up to a factor of 2. Our tests highlight and the importance of deep, high-resolution data and the need for careful consideration of: (1) the choice of priors (parametric approaches), (2) the masking (all approaches) and, more generally, evaluating the suitability of each approach to the specific data at hand. This paper accompanies the public release of DysmalPy.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 Orbital History: Did the Local Group evolve in isolation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use new measurements of the M31 proper motion to examine the Milky Way (MW) - M31 orbit and angular momentum. For Local Group (LG) mass consistent with measured values, and assuming the system evolves in isolation, we show a wide range of orbits is possible. We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in the Illustris simulation and find that $\sim 13\%$ of these pairs have undergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how accurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show that $\sim 10\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an orbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a lower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z \approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular momentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly explained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet recent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated two-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a major merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of DDO68 'Northern Ring' SF regions during years 2016-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96-7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called 'Northern Ring', in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016--2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988-2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached ~0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached ~0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the chi^{2} confidence level of alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are ~0.09, ~0.13, ~0.11, ~0.08 and ~0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of ~3.0 mag.</description>

The LVDB includes positional, structural, kinematic, chemical, and dynamical parameters for dwarf galaxies and star clusters. I discuss the motivation, structure, construction, and future expansion plans of the LVDB. I highlight catalogs on faint and compact ambiguous Milky Way systems, new Milky Way globular clusters and candidates, and globular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies. The LVDB is complete for known dwarf galaxies within $\sim 3 ~{\rm Mpc}$ and current efforts are underway to expand the database to resolved star systems in the Local Volume. I present publicly available examples and use cases of the LVDB focused on the census and population-level properties of the Local Group and discuss some theoretical avenues. The next decade will be an exciting era for near-field cosmology with many upcoming surveys and facilities, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that will both discover new dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Volume and characterize known dwarf galaxies and star clusters in more detail than ever before. The LVDB will be continually updated and is built to support and enable future dwarf galaxy and star cluster research in this data-rich era. The LVDB catalogs and package are publicly available as a GitHub repository, $\texttt{local_volume_database}$, and community use and contributions via GitHub are encouraged.</description>

      <title>Size Growth on Short Timescales of Star-Forming Galaxies: Insights from Size Variation with Rest-Frame Wavelength with JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate size variation with rest-frame wavelength for star-forming galaxies based on the second JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey data release. Star-forming galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelength from UV-to-NIR at $z&lt;3.5$, especially for more massive galaxies, indicating the inside-out assembly with in-situ star formation if ignoring dust attenuation. The size variation with wavelength shows strong dependence on stellar mass, and shows little or no dependence on redshift, specific star formation rate and galaxy environment. This suggests that the size growth of star-forming galaxies is a self-regulated process primarily governed by stellar mass. We model size as a function of both mass and redshift simultaneously, obtaining $R_{\rm e} \propto M_*^{0.23} (1+z)^{-1.04}$ at a wavelength of 0.45 ${\mu \mathrm{m}}$, and $R_{\rm e} \propto M_*^{0.20} (1+z)^{-1.08}$ at 1.0 ${\mu \mathrm{m}}$. Based on this size evolution and the star formation main sequence from the literature, we obtain the locus of typical size growth for individual galaxies of different masses on the mass-size plane. The moving trend of galaxies on the mass-size plane, which indicates the slopes of their locus, strongly correlates with the size ratio between 0.45 ${\mu \mathrm{m}}$ and 1.0 ${\mu \mathrm{m}}$, supporting the idea that the size variation with wavelength provides important information on size growth of galaxies on short timescales.</description>

      <title>Combining neural networks with galaxy light subtraction for discovering strong lenses in the HSC SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications. Strong lensing galaxies are rare, so efficient search methods, such as convolutional neural networks, are often used on large imaging datasets. In this work, we apply a new technique to improve the performance of supervised neural networks by subtracting the central (lensing) galaxy light from both the training and test datasets. We use multiband imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) as our training and test datasets. By subtracting the lensing galaxy light, we increase the contrast of the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. We also apply the light subtraction to non-lenses in order to compare them to the light-subtracted lenses. Residual features resulting from poor light subtraction can adversely affect the performance of networks trained on the subtracted images alone. We find that combining the light-subtracted images with the original gri-band images for training and classification can overcome this and improve the overall classification accuracy. We find the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved to 0.841 using the combination of the fiducial images and light-subtracted images, compared to 0.808 for the fiducial imaging dataset alone. This may be a promising technique for improving future lens searches using CNNs.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xu \&amp; Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass (\(M_h\)) and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index (\(n\)), at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of \(11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7\), using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on \(n\), we confirm a positive correlation between \(n\) and \(M_h\), and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of \(n\) and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between \(M_h\) and \(n\). Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive \(n-M_h\) relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Measures of luminous and dark matter in galaxies across time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is one of the pillars of the current standard model of structure formation: it is assumed to constitute most of the matter in the Universe. However, it can so far only be probed indirectly through its gravitational effects, and its nature remains elusive. In this focus meeting, we discussed different methods used to estimate galaxies' visible and dark matter masses in the nearby and distant Universe. We reviewed successes of the standard model relying on cold dark matter, confronted observations with simulations, and highlighted inconsistencies between the two. We discussed how robust mass measurements can help plan, perform, and refine particle dark matter searches. We further exchanged about alternatives to cold dark matter, such as warm, self-interacting, and fuzzy dark matter, as well as modified gravity. Finally, we discussed prospects and strategies that could be implemented to reveal the nature of this crucial component of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric identification of single-lined binary candidates in young clusters using single-epoch spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant H$_\mathrm{II}$ region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: ISM properties and metal enrichment in a merger-driven starburst during the Epoch of Reionisation probed with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and ALMA [CII]$\lambda$158$\mu$m observations of COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z$\sim$6.85, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. Both G395H (R$\sim$ 2700) and PRISM (R$\sim$ 100) NIRSpec observations revealed that COS-3018 is comprised of three separate components detected in [OIII]$\lambda$5008, which we dub as Main, North and East, with stellar masses of 10$^{9.4 \pm 0.1}$, 10$^{9.2 \pm 0.07}$, 10$^{7.7 \pm 0.15}$ M$_{\odot}$. We detect [OIII]$\lambda$5008, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$3727,29 and multiple Balmer lines in all three components together with [OIII]$\lambda$4363 in the Main and North components. This allows us to measure an ISM temperature of T$_{e}$= 1.27$\pm0.07\times 10^4$ and T$_{e}$= 1.6$\pm0.14\times 10^4$ K with densities of $n_{e}$ = 1250$\pm$250 and $n_{e}$ = 700$\pm$200 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. These deep observations allow us to measure an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.9--8.2 for the three components with the T$_{e}$-method. We do not find any significant evidence of metallicity gradients between the components. Furthermore, we also detect [NII]$\lambda$6585, one of the highest redshift detections of this emission line. We find that in a small, metal-poor clump 0.2 arcsec west of the North component, N/O is elevated compared to other regions, indicating that nitrogen enrichment originates from smaller substructures, possibly proto-globular clusters. [OIII]$\lambda$5008 kinematics show that this system is merging, which is probably driving the ongoing, luminous starburst.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Gas Nature in the Sub-parsec Region of the Active Galactic Nuclei. III. Eddington Ratio Dependence on the Structures of Dusty and Dust-free Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of the Eddington ratio on sub-parsec-scale outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) masses of $10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. When the range of Eddington ratio, $\gamma_{\rm Edd} &gt; 10^{-3}$, the radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and larger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows is a time-dependence phenomena, our simulations demonstrated that the radial distributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically symmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is influenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by the dynamical equilibrium condition. Although significantly affecting the outflow velocity, the Eddington ratio exerts minimal effects on temperature and number density distribution. Furthermore, our analytical solutions highlight the importance of the dust sublimation scale as a crucial determinant of terminal velocity and column density in dusty outflows. Through comparisons of our numerical model with the obscuring fraction observed in nearby AGNs, we revealed insights into the Eddington ratio dependence and the tendency towards the large obscuring fraction of the dusty and dust-free gases. The analytical solutions are expected to facilitate an understanding of the dynamical structure and radiation structures along the line of sight and their viewing angles from observations of ionized outflows.</description>

      <title>Broad-Line Region Characterization in Dozens of Active Galactic Nuclei Using Small-Aperture Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a nearly decade-long photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) survey of the H$\alpha$ emission line in nearby ($0.01\lesssim z \lesssim0.05$) Seyfert-Galaxies using small ($15\,\mathrm{cm}-40\,\mathrm{cm}$) telescopes. Broad-band filters were used to trace the continuum emission, while narrow-band filters tracked the H$\alpha$-line signal. We introduce a new PRM formalism to determine the time delay between continuum and line emission using combinations of auto- and cross-correlation functions. We obtain robust delays for 33/80 objects, allowing us to estimate the broad-line region (BLR) size. Additionally, we measure multi-epoch delays for 6 objects whose scatter per source is smaller than the scatter in the BLR size-luminosity relation. Our study enhances the existing H$\alpha$ size-luminosity relation by adding high-quality results for 31 objects, whose nuclear luminosities were estimated using the flux-variation gradient method, resulting in a scatter of 0.26dex within our sample. The scatter reduces to 0.17dex when the 6 lowest luminosity sources are discarded, which is comparable to that found for the H$\beta$ line. Single-epoch spectra enable us to estimate black hole masses using the H$\alpha$ line and derive mass accretion rates from the iron-blend feature adjacent to H$\beta$. A similar trend, as previously reported for the H$\beta$ line, is implied whereby highly accreting objects tend to lie below the size-luminosity relation of the general population. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of small telescopes in conducting high-fidelity PRM campaigns of prominent emission lines in bright active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\delta(\vec{x})$, and $v_{\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\sim$10.2\% and $\sim$9.2\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.</description>

      <title>The Hubble constant anchor galaxy NGC 4258: metallicity and distance from blue supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative spectroscopic study of blue supergiant stars in the Hubble constant anchor galaxy NGC 4258 is presented. The non-LTE analysis of Keck I telescope LRIS spectra yields a central logarithmic metallicity (in units of the solar value) of [Z] = -0.05\pm0.05 and a very shallow gradient of -(0.09\pm0.11)r/r25 with respect to galactocentric distance in units of the isophotal radius. Good agreement with the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies based on stellar absorption line studies is found. A comparison with HII region oxygen abundances obtained from the analysis of strong emission lines shows reasonable agreement when the Pettini &amp; Pagel (2004) calibration is used, while the Zaritsky et al. (1994) calibration yields values that are 0.2 to 0.3 dex larger. These results allow to put the metallicity calibration of the Cepheid Period--Luminosity relation in this anchor galaxy on a purely stellar basis. Interstellar reddening and extinction are determined using HST and JWST photometry. Based on extinction-corrected magnitudes, combined with the stellar effective temperatures and gravities we determine, we use the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship (FGLR) to estimate an independent spectroscopic distance. We obtain a distance modulus m-M = 29.38\pm0.12 mag, in agreement with the geometrical distance derived from the analysis of the water maser orbits in the galaxy's central circumnuclear disk.</description>

      <title>What drives the HI content of central galaxies -- A comparison between hydrodynamic simulations and observations using Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the driving mechanisms for the HI gas content in star-forming central galaxies at low redshift, by examining the HI-to-stelalr mass ratio ($M_{\rm HI}/M_\ast$) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the correlations of $M_{\rm HI}/M_\ast$ with a variety of galaxy properties using the random forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two simulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase metallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked mildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in real galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in TNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result can be understood from the fact that the HI gas is regulated mainly by thermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although neither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real galaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the observationally top-ranked property, $u-r$, is also highly ranked in EAGLE. This result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN feedback in driving the HI gas content of low-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Scale Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium: Observed and Simulated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.</description>

      <title>Simulating continuum-based redshift measurement in the \textit{Roman's} High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey</title>

Abstract: We investigate the capability of the \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's (Roman)} Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) G150 slitless grism to detect red, quiescent galaxies based on the current reference survey. We simulate dispersed images for \textit{Roman} reference High-Latitude Spectroscopic Survey (HLSS) and analyze two-dimensional spectroscopic data using the grism Redshift and Line Analysis (\verb|Grizli|) software. This study focus on assessing \textit{Roman} grism's capability for continuum-level redshift measurement for a redshift range of $0.5 \leq z \leq 2.5$. The redshift recovery is assessed by setting three requirements of: $\sigma_z = \frac{\left|z-z_{\mathrm{true}}\right|}{1+z}\leq0.01$, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) $\geq 5$ and the presence of a single dominant peak in redshift likelihood function. We find that, for quiescent galxaies, the reference HLSS can reach a redshift recovery completeness of $\geq50\%$ for F158 magnitude brighter than 20.2 mag. We also explore how different survey parameters, such as exposure time and the number of exposures, influence the accuracy and completeness of redshift recovery, providing insights that could optimize future survey strategies and enhance the scientific yield of the \textit{Roman} in cosmological research.</description>

      <title>Cosmography from accurate mass modeling of the lens group SDSS J0100+1818: five sources at three different redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems where multiple sources at different redshifts are strongly lensed by the same deflector allow one to directly investigate the evolution of the angular diameter distances with redshift, and thus to learn about the geometry of the Universe. We present measurements of the values of the total matter density, $\Omega_m$, and of the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$, through a strong lensing analysis of SDSSJ0100+1818, a group-scale system at $z=0.581$ with five lensed sources, from $z=1.698$ to $4.95$. We use new MUSE data to securely measure the redshift of 65 sources, including the five multiply imaged background sources (lensed into a total of 18 multiple images) and 19 galaxies on the deflector plane (the brightest group galaxy, BGG, and 18 fainter members), all employed to build robust strong lensing models with the software GLEE. We measure $\Omega_m = 0.14^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$ in a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) model, and $\Omega_m = 0.19^{+0.17}_{-0.10}$ and $w=-1.27_{-0.48}^{+0.43}$ in a flat $w$CDM model. We quantify, through a multi-plane approach, the impact of different sources angularly close in projection on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters. We obtain consistent median values, with uncertainties for only $\Omega_m$ increasing by a factor of 1.5. We accurately measure a total mass of $(1.55 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ within 50 kpc and a stellar over total mass profile decreasing from $45.6^{+8.7}_{-8.3}\%$ at the BGG effective radius to $(6.6\pm 1.1)\%$ at $R\approx 77$ kpc. Our results confirm that SDSSJ0100+1818 is one of the most massive (lens) galaxies known at intermediate redshift and that group-scale systems that act as lenses for $\geq 3$ background sources at different redshifts enable to estimate the values of the cosmological parameters with an accuracy that is competitive with that obtained from lens galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The formation of multiples in small-$N$ subclusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of $N$ stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between $N=$ 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of $N$ with mean $\mu_{_{N}}\sim4.8$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{_N}\sim2.4$. This fit is obtained when $\sim 50\%$ of the subcluster's internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and $\sim 50\%$ in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of $N$ are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. $N=$ 1 or 2), very similar values ($N=4.3\pm0.4$ and $N=4.5\pm1.9$) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.</description>

      <title>The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat $\Lambda$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between $\Lambda = 0$ and $10^5$ times the observed value, $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at $\sim$27% for $0.01 \lesssim \Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs} \lesssim 1$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of $\Lambda$ is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as $\Lambda$ increases, falling below 5% only for $\Lambda&gt;100 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on $\Lambda$, the median posterior value of $\Lambda$ is $539 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Furthermore, the probability of observing $\Lambda\leq \Lambda_{\rm obs}$ is only $0.5\%$. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with $\Lambda&lt;0$, the indication is thus that $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than $\Lambda$ alone must vary within the ensemble.</description>

      <title>The Relation between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era: I. Seyferts at Cosmic Noon are Obscured and Disturbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology of a galaxy reflects the mix of physical processes occurring within and around it, offering indirect clues to its formation and evolution. We apply both visual classification and computer vision to test the suspected connection between galaxy mergers and AGN activity, as evidenced by a close/merging galaxy pair, or tidal features surrounding an apparently singular system. We use JADES JWST/NIRCam imagery of a complete, mutliwavelength AGN sample recently expanded with JWST/MIRI photometry. This 0.9-25 $\mu$m dataset enables constraints on the host galaxy morphologies of a broad range of AGN beyond z$\sim$1, including heavily obscured examples missing from previous studies. Our primary AGN sample consists of 243 lightly to highly obscured X-ray-selected AGN and 138 presumed Compton-thick, mid-infrared-bright/X-ray-faint AGN revealed by MIRI. Utilizing the shape asymmetry morphology indicator, $A_S$, as the metric for disturbance, we find that 88% of the Seyferts sampled are strongly spatially disturbed ($A_S&gt;0.2$). The experimental design we employ reveals a $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ obscuration-merger ($N_H$-$A_S$) correlation at $0.6&lt;z&lt;2.4$, and also recovers a physical distinction between the X-ray- and mid-IR-detected AGN suggestive of their link to a common evolutionary scenario. Placing the observed pattern of disturbances in the context of the other average host galaxy properties, we conclude that mergers are common amongst obscured AGN. This finding presents tension with the leading model on AGN fueling that requires Seyfert AGN with sub-quasar luminosities ($L_{bol} &lt; 10^{45}$ ergs/s) to evolve only through non-merger mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Double Red Giant Branch and Red Clump features of Galactic disc stellar populations with Gaia GSPspec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To disentangle the different competing physical processes at play in Galactic evolution, a detailed chrono chemicalkinematical, and dynamical characterisation of the disc bimodality is necessary, including high number statistics. Here we make use of an extremely precise subsample of the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue of stellar chemophysical parameters. The selected database is composed of 408 800 stars with a median uncertainty of 10 K, 0.03 and 0.01 dex in Teff , log(g) and [M/H], respectively. The stellar parameter precision allows to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of disc stars. For the first time, the disc bimodality in the Kiel diagramme of giant stars is observed, getting rid of interstellar absortion issues. This bimodality produces double Red Giant Branch sequences and Red Clump features for mono-metallicity populations. A comparison with BaSTI isochrones allows to demonstrate that an age gap is needed to explain the evolutionary sequences separation, in agreement with previous age-metallicity relations obtained using sub-giant stars. A bimodal distribution in the stellar mass-[alpha/Fe] plane is observed at constant metallicity. Finally, a selection of stars with [M/H]=0.45 \pm 0.03 dex shows that the most metal-rich population in the Milky Way disc presents an important proportion of stars with ages in the range 5-13 Gyr. This old, extremely metal-rich population is possibly a mix of migrated stars from the internal Galactic regions, and old disc stars formed before the last major merger of the Milky Way. The Gaia GSP-Spec Kiel diagrammes of disc mono-abundance stellar populations reveal a complex, non linear age-metallicity relation crafted by internal and external processes of Galactic evolution. Their detailed analysis opens new opportunities to reconstruct the puzzle of the Milky Way disc bimodality.</description>

      <title>[X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights to its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from APOGEE DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.066 \pm 0.0004$ dex/kpc and a vertical metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.164 \pm 0.001$ dex/kpc. We find azimuthal variations ($\pm0.1$ dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in iron; older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the $\pm0.05$ dex-level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations. These results suggest that the spiral arms of the Galaxy are not solely responsible for azimuthal metallicity variations and other Galactic processes are at play.</description>

      <title>Direct-method metallicity gradients derived from spectral stacking with SDSS-IV MaNGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical abundances are key tracers of the cycle of baryons driving the evolution of galaxies. Most measurements of interstellar medium (ISM) abundance and metallicity gradients in galaxies are based, however, on model-dependent strong-line methods. Direct chemical abundances can be obtained via the detection of weak auroral lines, but such lines are too faint to be detected across large spectroscopic surveys of the local Universe. In this work we overcome this limitation and obtain metallicity gradients from direct method abundances by stacking spectra from the MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey. In particular we stack 4140 star-forming galaxies across the star formation rate-stellar mass (SFR-M$_\star$) plane and across six radial bins. We calculate electron temperatures for [OII], [SII], [NII], [SIII] and [OIII] across the majority of stacks. We find that the T[OII] $\sim$ T[SII] $\sim$ T[OII], as expected since these ions all trace the low-ionization zone of nebulae. The [OIII] temperatures become substantially larger than those of other ions at high metallicity, indicating potentially unaccounted for spectral contamination or additional physics. In light of this uncertainty we base our abundance calculation on the temperatures of [SIII] and the low-ionization ions. We recover a mass-metallicity relation (MZR) similar to that obtained with different empirical calibrations. We do not find evidence, however, for a secondary dependence on SFR using direct metallicities. Finally, we derive metallicity gradients that becomes steeper with stellar mass for $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &lt; 10.5$. At higher masses, the gradients flatten again, confirming with auroral line determinations the trends previously defined with strong-line calibrators.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt CorinoS (ECHOS) II. The puzzling chemistry of isomers as revealed by the HNCS/HSCN ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t&lt;10^4 yr) and low (Tg&lt;20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma, which is of fundamental interest to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, can be described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions that resolve long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on the continuous spectra, discrete Landau eigenmodes, and the decay of plasma echoes. We retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles (crucial for the plasma echo) and discrete modes that describe coherent oscillations of the entire system. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects or wave-particle interactions (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions, but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by the diffusion of particle velocities and occurs cubic exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the damping of velocities and diffusion of positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This slow exponential decay damps perturbations the most on scales $\lambda$ comparable to the mean free path $\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but very slowly on larger scales. This establishes local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit, and enhances the detectability of the plasma echo. The long-term decay is driven by the discrete modes for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but, by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped mode for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>

Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which is orbit averaged and accounts for loss cone events through a sink term. This formulation can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. The relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space has a simple analytic form, and it predicts accurately the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption, better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions - that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation. This allows to explore in a simple way dynamical effects that might affect tidal disruption events rates, tackling the expected vs observed rate tension and the over-representation of E+A galaxies.</description>
