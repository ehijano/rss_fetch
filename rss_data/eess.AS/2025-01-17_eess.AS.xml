      <title>persoDA: Personalized Data Augmentation forPersonalized ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is ubiquitously used in training of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. DA offers increased data variability, robustness and generalization against different acoustic distortions. Recently, personalization of ASR models on mobile devices has been shown to improve Word Error Rate (WER). This paper evaluates data augmentation in this context and proposes persoDA; a DA method driven by user's data utilized to personalize ASR. persoDA aims to augment training with data specifically tuned towards acoustic characteristics of the end-user, as opposed to standard augmentation based on Multi-Condition Training (MCT) that applies random reverberation and noises. Our evaluation with an ASR conformer-based baseline trained on Librispeech and personalized for VOICES shows that persoDA achieves a 13.9% relative WER reduction over using standard data augmentation (using random noise &amp; reverberation). Furthermore, persoDA shows 16% to 20% faster convergence over MCT.</description>

      <title>Towards detecting the pathological subharmonic voicing with fully convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many voice disorders induce subharmonic phonation, but voice signal analysis is currently lacking a technique to detect the presence of subharmonics reliably. Distinguishing subharmonic phonation from normal phonation is a challenging task as both are nearly periodic phenomena. Subharmonic phonation adds cyclical variations to the normal glottal cycles. Hence, the estimation of subharmonic period requires a wholistic analysis of the signals. Deep learning is an effective solution to this type of complex problem. This paper describes fully convolutional neural networks which are trained with synthesized subharmonic voice signals to classify the subharmonic periods. Synthetic evaluation shows over 98% classification accuracy, and assessment of sustained vowel recordings demonstrates encouraging outcomes as well as the areas for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Beyond Speaker Identity: Text Guided Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) traditionally relies on explicit clues about the speaker's identity like enrollment audio, face images, or videos, which may not always be available. In this paper, we propose a text-guided TSE model StyleTSE that uses natural language descriptions of speaking style in addition to the audio clue to extract the desired speech from a given mixture. Our model integrates a speech separation network adapted from SepFormer with a bi-modality clue network that flexibly processes both audio and text clues. To train and evaluate our model, we introduce a new dataset TextrolMix with speech mixtures and natural language descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively separates speech based not only on who is speaking, but also on how they are speaking, enhancing TSE in scenarios where traditional audio clues are absent. Demos are at: https://mingyue66.github.io/TextrolMix/demo/</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Transformers for Robust Acoustic Scene Classification in IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices equipped with acoustic sensors necessitates robust acoustic scene classification (ASC) capabilities, even in noisy and data-limited environments. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to generalize effectively under such conditions. To address this, we introduce Q-ASC, a novel Quantum-Inspired Acoustic Scene Classifier that leverages the power of quantum-inspired transformers. By integrating quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, Q-ASC achieves superior feature learning and enhanced noise resilience compared to classical models. Furthermore, we introduce a Quantum Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) based data augmentation technique to mitigate the challenge of limited labeled data in IoT deployments. Extensive evaluations on the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) Acoustic Scenes 2016 benchmark dataset demonstrate that Q-ASC achieves remarkable accuracy between 68.3% and 88.5% under challenging conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 5% in the best case. This research paves the way for deploying intelligent acoustic sensing in IoT networks, with potential applications in smart homes, industrial monitoring, and environmental surveillance, even in adverse acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>A Non-autoregressive Model for Joint STT and TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a step towards jointly modeling automatic speech recognition (STT) and speech synthesis (TTS) in a fully non-autoregressive way. We develop a novel multimodal framework capable of handling the speech and text modalities as input either individually or together. The proposed model can also be trained with unpaired speech or text data owing to its multimodal nature. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy to improve the STT and TTS performance of our model such that the partial hypothesis at the output can be fed back to the input of our model, thus iteratively improving both STT and TTS predictions. We show that our joint model can effectively perform both STT and TTS tasks, outperforming the STT-specific baseline in all tasks and performing competitively with the TTS-specific baseline across a wide range of evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Tessellated Linear Model for Age Prediction from Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice biometric tasks, such as age estimation require modeling the often complex relationship between voice features and the biometric variable. While deep learning models can handle such complexity, they typically require large amounts of accurately labeled data to perform well. Such data are often scarce for biometric tasks such as voice-based age prediction. On the other hand, simpler models like linear regression can work with smaller datasets but often fail to generalize to the underlying non-linear patterns present in the data. In this paper we propose the Tessellated Linear Model (TLM), a piecewise linear approach that combines the simplicity of linear models with the capacity of non-linear functions. TLM tessellates the feature space into convex regions and fits a linear model within each region. We optimize the tessellation and the linear models using a hierarchical greedy partitioning. We evaluated TLM on the TIMIT dataset on the task of age prediction from voice, where it outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Delayed Fusion: Integrating Large Language Models into First-Pass Decoding in End-to-end Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient decoding approach for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Although shallow fusion is the most common approach to incorporate language models into E2E-ASR decoding, we face two practical problems with LLMs. (1) LLM inference is computationally costly. (2) There may be a vocabulary mismatch between the ASR model and the LLM. To resolve this mismatch, we need to retrain the ASR model and/or the LLM, which is at best time-consuming and in many cases not feasible. We propose "delayed fusion," which applies LLM scores to ASR hypotheses with a delay during decoding and enables easier use of pre-trained LLMs in ASR tasks. This method can reduce not only the number of hypotheses scored by the LLM but also the number of LLM inference calls. It also allows re-tokenizion of ASR hypotheses during decoding if ASR and LLM employ different tokenizations. We demonstrate that delayed fusion provides improved decoding speed and accuracy compared to shallow fusion and N-best rescoring using the LibriHeavy ASR corpus and three public LLMs, OpenLLaMA 3B &amp; 7B and Mistral 7B.</description>

      <title>LAVCap: LLM-based Audio-Visual Captioning using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

      <title>Multimodal Marvels of Deep Learning in Medical Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive review of the potential of multimodal deep learning (DL) in medical diagnosis, using COVID-19 as a case example. Motivated by the success of artificial intelligence applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, this research aims to uncover the capabilities of DL in disease screening, prediction, and classification, and to derive insights that enhance the resilience, sustainability, and inclusiveness of science, technology, and innovation systems. Adopting a systematic approach, we investigate the fundamental methodologies, data sources, preprocessing steps, and challenges encountered in various studies and implementations. We explore the architecture of deep learning models, emphasising their data-specific structures and underlying algorithms. Subsequently, we compare different deep learning strategies utilised in COVID-19 analysis, evaluating them based on methodology, data, performance, and prerequisites for future research. By examining diverse data types and diagnostic modalities, this research contributes to scientific understanding and knowledge of the multimodal application of DL and its effectiveness in diagnosis. We have implemented and analysed 11 deep learning models using COVID-19 image, text, and speech (ie, cough) data. Our analysis revealed that the MobileNet model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.97% for COVID-19 image data and 93.73% for speech data (i.e., cough). However, the BiGRU model demonstrated superior performance in COVID-19 text classification with an accuracy of 99.89%. The broader implications of this research suggest potential benefits for other domains and disciplines that could leverage deep learning techniques for image, text, and speech analysis.</description>

      <title>Metric Learning with Progressive Self-Distillation for Audio-Visual Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric learning projects samples into an embedded space, where similarities and dissimilarities are quantified based on their learned representations. However, existing methods often rely on label-guided representation learning, where representations of different modalities, such as audio and visual data, are aligned based on annotated labels. This approach tends to underutilize latent complex features and potential relationships inherent in the distributions of audio and visual data that are not directly tied to the labels, resulting in suboptimal performance in audio-visual embedding learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture that integrates cross-modal triplet loss with progressive self-distillation. Our method enhances representation learning by leveraging inherent distributions and dynamically refining soft audio-visual alignments -- probabilistic alignments between audio and visual data that capture the inherent relationships beyond explicit labels. Specifically, the model distills audio-visual distribution-based knowledge from annotated labels in a subset of each batch. This self-distilled knowledge is used t</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional expression of speech for various applications, such as human-machine interaction. Previous deep learning-based approaches using generative adversarial networks and autoencoder models have shown promise but suffer from quality degradation and limited emotion control. To address these issues, a novel diffusion-based EVC framework with disentangled loss and expressive guidance is proposed. Our method separates speaker and emotional features to maintain speech quality while improving emotional expressiveness. Tested on real-world and acted-out datasets, the approach achieved significant improvements in emotion classification accuracy for both in-the-wild and act-out datasets and showed reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to enable the use of large, single-speaker ASR models, such as Whisper, for target speaker ASR. The key claim of this method is that it is much easier to model relative differences among speakers by learning to condition on frame-level diarization outputs than to learn the space of all speaker embeddings. We find that adding even a single bias term per diarization output type before the first transformer block can transform single-speaker ASR models into target-speaker ASR models. Our approach also supports speaker-attributed ASR by sequentially generating transcripts for each speaker in a diarization output. This simplified method outperforms baseline speech separation and diarization cascade by 12.9 % absolute ORC-WER on the NOTSOFAR-1 dataset.</description>

      <title>Editing Music with Melody and Text: Using ControlNet for Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the significant progress in controllable music generation and editing, challenges remain in the quality and length of generated music due to the use of Mel-spectrogram representations and UNet-based model structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) augmented with an additional control branch using ControlNet. This allows for long-form and variable-length music generation and editing controlled by text and melody prompts. For more precise and fine-grained melody control, we introduce a novel top-$k$ constant-Q Transform representation as the melody prompt, reducing ambiguity compared to previous representations (e.g., chroma), particularly for music with multiple tracks or a wide range of pitch values. To effectively balance the control signals from text and melody prompts, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy that progressively masks the melody prompt, resulting in a more stable training process. Experiments have been performed on text-to-music generation and music-style transfer tasks using open-source instrumental recording data. The results demonstrate that by extending StableAudio, a pre-trained text-controlled DiT model, our approach enables superior melody-controlled editing while retaining good text-to-music generation performance. These results outperform a strong MusicGen baseline in terms of both text-based generation and melody preservation for editing. Audio examples can be found at https://stable-audio-control.github.io.</description>

      <title>USED: Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker extraction and diarization are two enabling techniques for real-world speech applications. Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating `who spoke when'. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about `who spoke what and when', which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixtures with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. We further validate the diarization performance on CALLHOME, a dataset based on real recordings, and experimental results indicate that our model surpasses recently proposed approaches.</description>

Abstract: Speech encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to content, paralinguistic, and environmental information. This comprehensive nature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for human-computer interaction. Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle multi-modal inputs, including speech. Although these models can be adept at recognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating appropriate responses. We argue that this is due to the lack of principles on task definition and model development, which requires open-source datasets and metrics suitable for model evaluation. To bridge the gap, we present SD-Eval, a benchmark dataset aimed at multidimensional evaluation of spoken dialogue understanding and generation. SD-Eval focuses on paralinguistic and environmental information and includes 7,303 utterances, amounting to 8.76 hours of speech data. The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound. To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a process similar to that of SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses. Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics. We open-source SD-Eval at https://github.com/amphionspace/SD-Eval.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-Variant Responses of Optical Compressors with Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling optical dynamic range compressors using deep neural networks with Selective State Space models. The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.</description>

      <title>Sines, Transient, Noise Neural Modeling of Piano Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sines, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.</description>

      <title>AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench. The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/AudioBERT}.</description>

      <title>Frechet Music Distance: A Metric For Generative Symbolic Music Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Frechet Music Distance (FMD), a novel evaluation metric for generative symbolic music models, inspired by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in computer vision and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) in generative audio. FMD calculates the distance between distributions of reference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical features. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate that FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific metric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a reproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.</description>

      <title>VITA-1.5: Towards GPT-4o Level Real-Time Vision and Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.</description>
