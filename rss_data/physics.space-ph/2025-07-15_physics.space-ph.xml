      <title>Studying Ionospheric Phase Structure Functions Using Wide-Band uGMRT (Band-4) Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1~GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Reliability of the AfriTEC Model During the Descending Phase of Solar Cycle 24 Across East Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the reliability of the African Regional Ionospheric Total Electron Content (AfriTEC) model during the descending phase of Solar Cycle 24 (2016-2017) across East Africa. Using GNSS-derived TEC data from five equatorial and low-latitude stations MOIU, MAL2, ZAMB, ADIS, and MBAR the model's performance is assessed through statistical metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficient r. Results indicate that the AfriTEC model effectively captures the diurnal and seasonal behavior of TEC, particularly during equinoxes, with MAE values generally below 1.5 TECU and correlation coefficients exceeding 0.80. However, discrepancies emerge during solstice periods and post-sunset hours, reflecting the model's limitations in representing complex ionospheric processes such as the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA). To benchmark its performance, AfriTEC is also compared against the widely used NeQuick model. AfriTEC demonstrates superior regional adaptability and reduced error under most conditions, though it remains sensitive to localized ionospheric disturbances. These findings suggest that while AfriTEC is a valuable tool for ionospheric modeling in whole Africa especially at East African sector, enhancements incorporating real-time solar and geomagnetic indices could further improve its predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Generation of Surface Sausage Oscillations of a Current Sheet and Propagating Magnetoacoustic Waves by Impulsive Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate. Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves. Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet, for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the parameters of our experiment.</description>

      <title>Cometary ion dynamics at 67P: A collisional test-particle approach with Rosetta data comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rosetta spacecraft escorted comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for two years, gathering a rich and variable dataset. Amongst the data from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) suite of instruments are measurements of the total electron density from the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and Langmuir Probe (LAP).
  At low outgassing, the plasma density measurements can be explained by a simple balance between the production through ionisation and loss through transport. Ions are assumed to travel radially at the outflow speed of the neutral gas. Near perihelion, the assumptions of this field-free chemistry-free model are no longer valid, and plasma density is overestimated. This can be explained by enhanced ion transport by an ambipolar electric field inside the diamagnetic cavity, where the interplanetary magnetic field does not reach.
  In this study, we explore the transition between these two regimes, at intermediate outgassing ($5.4 \times10^{26}~\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), when the interaction between the cometary and solar wind plasma influences the transport of the ions. We use a 3D collisional test-particle model, adapted from Stephenson et al. 2022 to model the cometary ions with input electric and magnetic fields from a hybrid simulation for 2.5-3 au. The total plasma density from this model is then compared to data from MIP/LAP and to the field-free chemistry-free model. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of the hybrid approach and demonstrate the importance of modelling collisional cooling of the electrons to understand the ion dynamics close to the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of real-time astronomy, citizen scientists play an increasingly important role in the discovery and follow-up of transient astrophysical phenomena. From local astronomical societies to global initiatives, amateur astronomers contribute valuable observational data that complement professional efforts. Astro-COLIBRI facilitates these contributions by providing a user-friendly platform that integrates real-time alerts, data visualization tools, and collaborative features to support astronomers at all levels.
  The Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program provides engagement opportunities across multiple scales. At the grassroots level, we collaborate with local astronomy clubs, equipping them with accessible tools for transient event monitoring. National and international networks, such as RAPAS in France, leverage Astro-COLIBRI's real-time capabilities for coordinated observations. On a global scale, we actively participate in high-impact citizen science and capacity building initiatives, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Citizen Science Program and the "Open Universe" initiative led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). These collaborations enhance the accessibility of real-time astrophysical data and foster inclusive participation in cutting-edge astronomy.
  In this contribution, we will present the Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program, highlighting its technical framework, community impact, and case studies of successful amateur contributions. We will showcase how our platform facilitates the rapid exchange of information between professional and amateur astronomers, democratizing access to multi-messenger astrophysics and enabling the global community to contribute meaningfully to time-domain discoveries.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Voyager Magnetic Field Beyond the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulations and Observations: New Insights into Galaxy Formation Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is often assumed recently that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection, when the magnetic null point is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are usually strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb.</description>
