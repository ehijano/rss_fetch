      <title>Technical assessment of a novel vertical CT system for upright radiotherapy simulation and treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To characterize image quality, imaging dose, and dose calculation accuracy for an upright CT scanner with a six-degree-of-freedom patient positioning system. Methods: Imaging dose (CTDIvol) was measured at 120 kVp and 200 mAs. Image quality was evaluated using an ACR-464 phantom. Mean CT number accuracy was assessed within inserts of known material and uniformity as the difference in values at the center and periphery of uniform phantoms. High-contrast resolution was assessed by visible line pairs and modulation transfer function (MTF). Low-contrast performance was quantified by contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR). Spatial integrity was evaluated between fiducials 100 mm apart. Hounsfield unit to mass density and stopping-power-ratio calibrations were performed. Proton and photon treatment plans were optimized on upright CT scans of a thorax phantom in heterogenous and homogeneous regions. Dose was forward computed on a registered recumbent CT scan and agreement evaluated using 3D gamma analysis. Results: CT imaging dose (CTDIvol) was 23.5 mGy for the 16 cm head phantom and 10.1 mGy for the 32 cm body phantom. Mean CT numbers (HU) were within the expected range for water (1.7) and acrylic (120.8). CT numbers were slightly (5-27 HU) out-of-range for air (-950.4), polyethylene (-78.8), and bone (823.0). Image uniformity was 20.2 HU and 35.0 HU for 20 cm and 48 cm diameter phantoms, respectively. Eight high-contrast line pairs were visualized. The MTF equaled 4.4 cm-1 at 50% and 7.1 cm-1 at 10%. The median CNR was 0.93, below the 1.0 tolerance. Spatial integrity was 0.36 mm. Gamma pass rates were 99.8% for photon and 90.6% for proton plans with 1%/1mm criteria, and greater than or equal to 98.0% for all plans with 3%/2mm criteria. Conclusion: Upright CT image quality and dose calculation accuracy are acceptable for photon and proton radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Cross-Section-Based Scaling Method for Material-Specific Cluster Dose Calculations - A Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-section data unavailability for non-water materials in track structure simulation software necessitates nanodosimetric quantity transformation from water to other materials. Cluster dose calculation transformation initially employed mass-density-based scaling - an approach resulting in a physically unrealistic material-independence of the cluster dose equation. This study introduces an alternative scaling method based on material-specific ionization cross-sections. The mean free path ratio of the materials for both the primary particles of the track structure simulation and for the secondary electrons served as the scaling factor. The approach was demonstrated through a cluster dose calculation for a carbon ion beam in a realistic head geometry and compared to the previous scaling method. The proposed cross-section-based scaling method resulted in a physically expected increase in cluster dose values for denser materials, which was not visible in the original scaling approach. The introduced scaling approach can be used to determine cluster dose distributions in heterogeneous geometries, a fundamental requirement for its integration into radiotherapy treatment planning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>

      <title>Group-Level and Personalized Optimization for the Insula and Hippocampus Focal Electric Field in Transcranial Temporal Interferential Stimulation: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) for focal targeting of the insula and hippocampus, which are clinically relevant yet anatomically difficult to stimulate. Individualized and group-level electrode optimizations were compared to determine whether generalized montages can provide reliable targeting with reduced modeling demands. Sixty high-resolution head models (30 individuals and their mirrored counterparts) were constructed from T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Electric fields (EFs) were computed using the scalar-potential finite-difference method. Electrode montages and current ratios were optimized to minimize the root-mean-square error between simulated and target EF envelope (EFE) distributions, with a threshold of 0.3 V/m. Subsampling analysis was performed to estimate the number of models required for stable group-level outcomes. For the insula, a montage combining T7-P7 and Fp1-Fp2 achieved the highest focality, comparable to individualized results with reduced variability. For the hippocampus, the F7-T7 and T8-P8 montage gave the best group-level focality, though individualized optimization improved off-target suppression. Stable group-level patterns were obtained using 20 models for the insula and 9 for the hippocampus. Optimal tTIS montages depend on target depth. Group-level optimization suffices for cortical regions like the insula, whereas individualized tuning remains preferable for deeper targets such as the hippocampus.</description>

      <title>Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge for CT Reconstruction from Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work, we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score. In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.</description>

      <title>Over four minutes relaxation of pyruvate using chemically and physically induced deceleration of relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [1-13C]pyruvate is the most widely used tracer for hyperpolarized metabolic magnetic resonance imaging, with profound applications in tumor and inflammation diagnosis as well as treatment monitoring. The most fundamental hurdle to broader application, however, remains the rapid polarization relaxation and the associated signal loss. Here, we report a method to address this challenge. Studying the nuclear spin relaxation dispersion of [1-13C]pyruvate across magnetic fields from 8 {\mu}T to 9.4 T, as a function of additives, solvents, and preparation methods, allowed us to achieve relaxation times of up to four minutes. Such a long time could enable reliable quality control and nearly polarization loss-free transport, further boosting the power of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI.</description>

      <title>Zero Echo Time Functional MRI in Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Conventional echo planar imaging(EPI) based functional MRI(fMRI) uses the BOLD contrast to map activity changes in human brains. Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Novel Quantitative Multiparametric MR Sequence for Radiation Therapy Treatment Response Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate a Deep-Learning-enhanced MUlti-PArametric MR sequence (DL-MUPA) for treatment response assessment for brain metastases patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and head-and-neck (HnN) cancer patients undergoing conventionally fractionation adaptive radiation therapy. Methods: DL-MUPA derives quantitative T1 and T2 maps from a single 4-6-minute scan denoised via DL method using dictionary fitting. Phantom benchmarking was performed on a NIST-ISMRM phantom. Longitudinal patient data were acquired on a 1.5T MR-simulator, including pre-treatment (PreTx) and every 3 months after SRS (PostTx) in brain, and PreTx, mid-treatment and 3 months PostTx in HnN. Changes of mean T1 and T2 values were calculated within gross tumor volumes (GTVs), residual disease (RD, HnN), parotids, and submandibular glands (HnN) for treatment response assessment. Uninvolved normal tissues (normal appearing white matter in brain, masseter in HnN) were evaluated to as control. Results: Phantom benchmarking showed excellent inter-session repeatability (coefficient of variance &lt;1% for T1, &lt;7% for T2). Uninvolved normal tissue suggested acceptable in-vivo repeatability (brain |$\Delta$|&lt;6%, HnN |$\Delta$T1|&lt;7%, |$\Delta$T2|&lt;18% (4ms)). Remarkable changes were noted in resolved brain metastasis ($\Delta$T1=14%) and necrotic settings ($\Delta$T1=18-40%, $\Delta$T2=9-41%). In HnN, two primary tumors showed T2 increase (PostTx GTV $\Delta$T2&gt;13%, RD $\Delta$T2&gt;18%). A nodal disease resolved PostTx (GTV $\Delta$T1=-40%, $\Delta$T2=-33%, RD $\Delta$T1=-29%, $\Delta$T2=-35%). Enhancement was found in involved parotids (PostTx $\Delta$T1&gt;12%, $\Delta$T2&gt;13%) and submandibular glands (PostTx $\Delta$T1&gt;15%, $\Delta$T2&gt;35%) while the uninvolved organs remained stable. Conclusions: DL-MUPA shows promise for treatment response assessment and identifying potential endpoints for functional sparing.</description>

      <title>Dipolar order mapping based on spin-lock magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) effect reflects dipolar order with a dipolar relaxation time ($T_{1D}$), specific to motion-restricted macromolecules. We aim to quantify $T_{1D}$ using spin-lock MRI implemented with a novel rotary-echo sequence. Methods: In proposed method, we defined a relaxation rate $R_{dosl}$ that is specific to dipolar order and obtained as the difference of dual-frequency $R_{1rho}^{dual}$ relaxation and single-frequency $R_{1rho}^{single}$ relaxation. A novel rotary-echo spin-lock sequence was developed to enable dual-frequency acquisition. We derive the framework to estimate $T_{1D}$ from $R_{dosl}$ under macromolecular pool fraction (MPF) map constraints. The proposed approach was validated via Bloch-McConnell-Provotorov simulation, phantom studies, and in-vivo white matter studies on a 3T scanner. Results: Simulations demonstrated that $R_{dosl}$ exhibits an approximately linear relationship with $T_{1D}$. Phantom experiments showed robust ihMT contrast in $R_{dosl}$ and confirmed the feasibility and reliability of $T_{1D}$ quantification via $R_{dosl}$. In vivo white-matter studies further supported the clinical potential of this $T_{1D}$ mapping approach. Conclusion: We propose a novel, clinical feasible method for $T_{1D}$ quantification based on spin-lock MRI. This method requires substantially fewer contrast-prepared images compared to the conventional $T_{1D}$ quantification approach. This technique provides a promising pathway for robust MPF and $T_{1D}$ quantification in a single rapid scan with reduced confounds.</description>
