      <title>Extremes of the zero-average Gaussian Free Field on random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extreme value statistics of the zero-average Gaussian free field (GFF) on random $r$-regular graphs and the Gaussian free field on $r$-regular trees. For random $r$-regular graphs of diverging size, for every fixed $r\ge3$, we show that the rescaled extremal point process of the field is asymptotically distributed, in the annealed sense, as a Poisson point process on the line with intensity $e^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x$. The same limit behaviour is obeyed by the restriction of the GFF on $r$-regular trees to finite subsets of vertices. Our approach relies on a direct Gaussian comparison argument and precise Green function estimates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Ordering for Bernoulli and Normal Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(S_n^p)_{n\geq 0}$ be a Bernoulli random walk where each of the independent increments is either $1$ or $-1$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$. For $p'$ and $p'' \in [0,1]$ with $|p'-1/2|&gt;|p''-1/2|$, we show that $(|S_n^{p''}|)_{n\geq 0}$ is stochastically smaller than $(|S_n^{p'}|)_{n\geq 0}$. In other words, $(|S_n^{p}|)_{n\geq 0}$ is stochastically decreasing in $p \in [0,1/2]$ and increasing in $p\in [1/2,1]$. An analogous result is also given for the family of normal random walks indexed by $\mu \in R$ where each of the independent increments is normally distributed with common mean $\mu$ and variance $1$. Extension to Brownian motion then follows by a limiting argument. As an application, these results are used to easily derive stochastic ordering properties for stopping times of Bernoulli and normal random walks.</description>

      <title>Martingale Characterizations of Non-Homogeneous Counting Processes and Their Fractional Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the martingale characterizations of non-homogeneous counting processes and their fractional generalizations. We show that the weighted sum of non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NPPs) is the non-homogeneous generalized counting process (NGCP). Both the compensated and exponential forms of martingale characterization for NGCP are obtained, and are shown to be equivalent. Moreover, we provide martingale characterizations for various time-changed variants of the NGCP and their Skellam versions using stable and/or inverse stable subordinators.</description>

      <title>Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Stability of storage processes with general release rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper quantifies the ergodicity and the rate of decay of the tail of the stationary distribution for a broad class of storage models, encompassing constant, linear, and power-type release rates with both finite and infinite activity input process. Our results are expressed in terms of the asymptotics of the release rate, the tail-decay rate of the L\'evy measure of the input process and its (possibly infinite) first moment. Our framework unifies and significantly extends classical results on the stability of storage models. Under certain regularity assumptions, we also provide upper bounds on the stability in the Wasserstein distance.</description>

  p_\varepsilon(x)=(2\pi\varepsilon)^{-d/2}e^{|x|^2/2\varepsilon},x\in\mathbb{R}^d, d\geq2 is the heat kernel, exits in L^2 sense if and only if H&lt;\frac{3}{2(1+d)} and satisfies three different central limit theorems when normalized by \varepsilon^{\frac d2+1-\frac1H} for H&gt;\frac12 and d\geq2, normalized by \varepsilon^{\frac d2+\frac12-\frac 3{4H}} for \frac{3}{2(1+d)}&lt;H&lt;\frac12 and d\geq3, and normalized by \log(1/\varepsilon)^{-\frac12} for the critical case H=\frac{3}{2(1+d)} and d\geq3.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review paper, we describe the use of couplings in several different mathematical problems. We consider the total variation norm, maximal coupling, and the $\bar{d}$-distance. We present a detailed proof of a result recently proved: the dual of the Ruelle operator is a contraction with respect to $1$-Wasserstein distance. We also show exponential convergence to equilibrium in the state space for finite-state Markov chains when the transition matrix $\mathcal{P}$ has all entries positive.}
  In this new version, we describe in more detail the line of reasoning followed in the work previously published as a chapter in ``Modeling, Dynamics, Optimization and Bioeconomics II'', Springer Verlag (2017).</description>

Abstract: A random number of items each independently marked with one of a collection of colours gives rise to the multinomial marking, which generalises binomial thinning. A multivariate version, where previously marked items are then re-marked, has similar properties to taking a linear transformation of a random vector.</description>

      <title>A weak convergence approach to the large deviations of the dynamic Schr\"odinger problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider large deviations for dynamical Schr\"odinger problems, using the variational approach developed by Dupuis, Ellis, Budhiraja, and others. Recent results on scaled families of Schr\"odinger problems, in particular by Bernton, Ghosal, and Nutz, and the authors, have established large deviation principles for the static problem. For the dynamic problem, only the case with a scaled Brownian motion reference process has been explored by Kato.
  Here, we derive large deviation results using the variational approach, with the aim of going beyond the Brownian reference dynamics considered by Kato. Specifically, we develop a uniform on compacts Laplace principle for bridge processes conditioned on their endpoints. When combined with existing results for the static problem, this leads to a large deviation principle for the corresponding (dynamic) Schr\"odinger bridge. In addition to the specific results of the paper, our work puts such large deviation questions into the weak convergence framework, and we conjecture that the results can be extended to cover also more involved types of reference dynamics. Specifically, we provide an outlook on applying the result to reflected Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Density Shaping Model Predictive Gust Load Alleviation Control of a Compliant Wing Subjected to Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.</description>

      <title>Hashpower allocation in Pay-per-Share blockchain mining pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining blocks in a blockchain using the \textit{Proof-of-Work} consensus protocol involves significant risk, as network participants face continuous operational costs while earning infrequent capital gains upon successfully mining a block. A common risk mitigation strategy is to join a mining pool, which combines the computing resources of multiple miners to provide a more stable income. This article examines a Pay-per-Share (PPS) reward system, where the pool manager can adjust both the share difficulty and the management fee. Using a simplified wealth model for miners, we explore how miners should allocate their computing resources among different mining pools, considering the trade-off between risk transfer to the manager and management fees.</description>

      <title>Efficient reconstruction of multidimensional random field models with heterogeneous data using stochastic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of stochastic differential equations driven by White Gaussian noise sources whose solutions can be drawn from skewed Gaussian probability laws, here referred as skew-Normal diffusion (SKN) processes. The non-Gaussian character results from implementing a nonlinear and time-inhomogneous drift constructed via ad-hoc changes of probability measure (i.e. Doob's $h$-transform). The SKN processes can be alternatively constructed as dynamic censoring models. While explicitly non-Gaussian, the SKN processes share several properties of Gaussian processes, in particular the invariance under linear transformations. This result allows us to discuss analytically the characteristics of this class of stochastic dynamics. As an illustration, we show how linear noisy monitoring of SKN processes yields a solvable finite dimensional and non-linear stochastic filtering which naturally extends the Kalman-Bucy Gaussian case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish basic properties of the heat flow on entire holomorphic functions that have order at most 2. We then look specifically at the action of the heat flow on the Gaussian analytic function (GAF). We show that applying the heat flow to a GAF and then rescaling and multiplying by an exponential of a quadratic function gives another GAF. It follows that the zeros of the GAF are invariant in distribution under the heat flow, up to a simple rescaling.
  We then show that the zeros of the GAF evolve under the heat flow approximately along straight lines, with an error whose distribution is independent of the starting point. Finally, we connect the heat flow on the GAF to the metaplectic representation of the double cover of the group $SL(2;\mathbb{R}).$</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a pathogen with two allelic types infecting a population of hosts, where within-host type frequencies evolve in discrete time. Our framework is built on a two-parameter family of transition kernels on [0,1], which describe one-step updates of type frequencies. In the absence of host interaction, the single-host type-frequency process admits, for a broad class of parameters, a moment dual with a branching-coalescing structure reminiscent of the Ancestral Selection Graph. Under suitable parameter and time scalings, it converges to a Wright--Fisher diffusion with drift. To incorporate interactions among hosts, we introduce a mean-field mechanism whereby within-host dynamics depend on the empirical type distribution across the population. We prove uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, comparing the dynamics in a typical host with a corresponding non-linear Markov chain. Under appropriate scaling, this non-linear chain converges to a McKean--Vlasov Wright--Fisher diffusion. As an illustration, we analyse a model where mutation rates depend on the current type distribution across hosts and establish uniform-in-time propagation of chaos together with ergodicity of the limiting McKean--Vlasov equation.</description>

      <title>High-degree cubature on Wiener space through unshuffle expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilising classical results on the structure of Hopf algebras, we develop a novel approach for the construction of cubature formulae on Wiener space based on unshuffle expansions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by constructing the first explicit degree-7 cubature formula on $d$-dimensional Wiener space with drift, in the sense of Lyons and Victoir. The support of our degree-7 formula is significantly smaller than that of currently implemented or proposed constructions.</description>

      <title>Queueing models with random resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study some queueing models with random resetting, including Markovian and non--Markovian models. The Markovian models include M/M/1, M/M/$\infty$, M/M/r and M/M/1+M queues with random resetting, in which a continuous-time Markov chain is formulated, with transitions including a resetting to state zero in addition to arrivals and services. Hence the chains are no longer a birth and death process as in the classical models. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the queueing processes in these models. The M/M/1, M/M/$\infty$ and M/M/2 models with random resetting have been studied as models with catastrophes; our methods and analysis complements that literature. In particular, the proof techniques are different and the formulas for M/M/$\infty$ and M/M/2 models have alternative and concise expressions. The non--Markovian models include GI/GI/1, GI/GI/$r$ and GI/GI/$\infty$ queues with random resetting to state zero. For GI/GI/1 and GI/GI/$r$ queues, we consider random resetting at arrival times, and introduce modified Lindley recursions and Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursions, respectively. Using an operator representation for these recursions, we characterize the stationary distributions via convergent series, as solutions to the modified Wiener--Hopf equations. For GI/GI/1 queues with random resetting, a particularly interesting case is when the difference of the service and interarrival times is positive, for which an explicit characterization of the stationary distribution of the delay/waiting time is provided via the associated characteristic functions. For GI/GI/$\infty$ queues, we also consider random resettings at arrival times, by utilizing a version of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursion motivated from that for GI/GI/$r$ queues, and also characterize the corresponding stationary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to extend the Sample-Path Large Deviation Principle for the urn model of Hill, Lane and Sudderth to the case in which the increment of the urn is not a binary variable. In particular, we sketch how to modify the Theorem 1 given in [Stochastic Processes and their Applications 127 (2017) 3372-3411] to include also urn processes with increments taking more than two values.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a&gt;0 is the 'multiplicity' of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H&gt;1,0&lt;H&lt;1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Detecting practically significant dependencies in metric spaces via distance correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a different look at the problem of testing the independence of two metric-space-valued random variables using the distance correlation. Instead of testing if the distance correlation vanishes exactly, we are interested in the hypothesis that it does not exceed a certain threshold. Our testing problem is motivated by the observation that in many cases it is more reasonable to test for a practically significant dependency since it is rare that a hypothesis of perfect independence is exactly satisfied. This point of view also reflects statistical practice, where one often classifies the strength of the association in categories such as `small', `medium' and `large' and the precise definitions depend on the specific application. To address these problems we develop a pivotal test for the hypothesis that the distance correlation between two random variables does not exceed a pre-specified threshold $\Delta$. We also determine a minimum value $\hat \Delta_\alpha$ from the data such that the hypothesis is rejected for all $\Delta \leq \hat \Delta_\alpha$ at controlled type I error $\alpha$. This quantity can be interpreted as a measure of evidence against the hypothesis that the distance correlation is less or equal than $\Delta$. The new test is applicable to processes taking values in separable metric spaces of strong negative type, covering Euclidean as well as functional data. We do not assume independent observations, and instead prove our results for absolutely regular sample generating processes, which includes many time series such as ARMA and GARCH models. Our approach is based on a new functional limit theorem for the sequential distance correlation process, and can also be used to construct confidence intervals for the distance correlation without the need for resampling.</description>

      <title>The random $k$-SAT Gibbs uniqueness threshold revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of a Passive Scalar Transported by Locally Supported White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic perturbations of transport type are a common and widely accepted way of representing turbulent effects in fluid dynamics models. In many known examples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as \emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the topic is the so-called \emph{It\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting Stratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can show that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology, to an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order elliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector. In this work, we deal with a passive scalar model with molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Starting from the results in [Flandoli \emph{et al.}, 2022, \emph{Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent and compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of stratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq models. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the limit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in literature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order elliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from Homogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective diffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in the $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number of vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally, we provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity, discovering a nonlinear behavior for $\kappa \rightarrow 0$, in some regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Time Derivative of the KL Divergence for a Generalized Langevin Annealing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Langevin diffusion process $\mathrm{d} X_t = \nabla \log p_t(X_t) + \sqrt{2}\mathrm{d} W_t$ guided by the time-dependent probability density $p_t(x)$. Let $q_t$ be the density of $X_t$. Recently, in order to analyze convergence in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the time derivative of $t\mapsto \mathrm{KL}(q_t|p_t)$ has been used in several works without investigating in detail when such a derivative exists. In this short manuscript we provide a rigorous derivation of the quantity $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\mathrm{KL}(q_t|p_t)$.</description>
