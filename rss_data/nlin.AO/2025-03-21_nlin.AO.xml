      <title>Noise equals endogenous control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>

      <title>Machine learning identifies nullclines in oscillatory dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CLINE (Computational Learning and Identification of Nullclines), a neural network-based method that uncovers the hidden structure of nullclines from oscillatory time series data. Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph reconstruction from dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of methods have been developed in the past two decades to infer the underlying network structure of an interconnected system from its collective dynamics. However, methods capable of inferring nonpairwise interactions are only starting to appear. Here, we develop an inference algorithm based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to reconstruct hypergraphs and simplicial complexes from time-series data. Our model-free method does not require information about node dynamics or coupling functions, making it applicable to complex systems that do not have a reliable mathematical description. We first benchmark the new method on synthetic data generated from Kuramoto and Lorenz dynamics. We then use it to infer the effective connectivity in the brain from resting-state EEG data, which reveals significant contributions from non-pairwise interactions in shaping the macroscopic brain dynamics.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>
