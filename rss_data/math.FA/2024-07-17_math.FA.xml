      <title>Frequently recurrent backward shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study frequently recurrent unilateral and bilateral backward shift operators on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. We prove that if a backward shift admits a non-zero frequently recurrent vector, then it supports a dense set of such vectors, so that the operator is frequently recurrent. As a consequence, we provide two different characterizations for frequently recurrent backward shift operators and we show dense lineability of the set of the set of frequently recurrent vectors.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz estimates in the Besov settings for Young and rough differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a set of techniques that enable us to effectively recover Besov rough analysis from p-variation rough analysis. Central to our approach are new metric groups, in which some objects in rough path theory that have been previously viewed as two-parameter can be considered as path increments. Furthermore, we develop highly precise Lipschitz estimates for Young and rough differential equations, both in the variation and Besov scale.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Fourier Quasicrystals from Lee-Yang Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Fourier quasicrystals with unit masses in arbitrary dimensions. This generalizes a one-dimensional construction of Kurasov and Sarnak. To do this, we employ a class of complex algebraic varieties avoiding certain regions in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which generalize hypersurfaces defined by Lee-Yang polynomials. We show that these are Delone almost periodic sets that have at most finite intersection with every discrete periodic set.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative probability, joint distributions, conditioning, and the associated polymorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <title>Growth estimates on optimal transport maps via concentration inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof and some extensions of results of Carlier, Figalli and Santambrogio on polynomial upper bounds on the Brenier map between probability measures under various conditions on the densities. The proofs are based on the monotonicity of the map and various concentration inequalities, as already used by Colombo and Fathi to prove quadratic growth for transport maps from the standard Gaussian onto log-concave measures.</description>

      <title>Isometric dilation and Sarason's commutant lifting theorem in several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article deals with isometric dilation and commutant lifting for a class of $n$-tuples $(n \geq 3)$ of commuting contractions. We show that operator tuples in the class dilate to tuples of commuting isometries of BCL type. As a consequence of such an explicit dilation, we show that their von Neumann inequality holds on a one dimensional variety of the closed unit polydisc. On the basis of such a dilation, we prove a commutant lifting theorem of Sarason's type by establishing that every commutant can be lifted to the dilation space in a commuting and norm preserving manner. This further leads us to find yet another class of $n$-tuples $(n\geq 3)$ of commuting contractions each of which possesses isometric dilation.</description>

      <title>Invariant Differential Operators and the Radon Transform on the Horocycle Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the range theorem for the Radon transform for double fibrations of the horocycle spaces for the semisimple symmetric spaces by the invariant differential operators or the invariant system of differential operators constructed from the action of the transformation group. This theorem also implies the range theorem for the Radon transform for double fibrations of non-symmetric compact homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and scattering for wave equations on hyperbolic spaces with singular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave and Klein-Gordon equations on the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ ($n \geq2$) in a framework based on weak-$L^{p}$ spaces. First, we establish dispersive estimates on Lorentz spaces in the context of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Then, employing those estimates, we prove global well-posedness of solutions and an exponential asymptotic stability property. Moreover, we develop a scattering theory and construct wave operators in such singular framework.</description>
