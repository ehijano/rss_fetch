      <title>Special Hermitian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability at blow-up and deformations of a class of Hermitian metrics whose fundamental two-form $\omega$ satisfies the condition $\partial \bar \partial \omega^k=0$, for any $k$ between 1 and $n-1$ (where $n$ is the complex dimension of the manifold). We are motivated by the existence of compact complex manifold supporting such metrics.</description>

      <title>From $\lambda$-connections to $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-opers with apparent singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of diffeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>A note on the scattering theory of Kato-Ricci manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove a new $L^1$ criterion for the existence and completeness of the wave operators corresponding to the Laplace-Beltrami operators corresponding to two Riemannian metrics on a fixed noncompact manifold. Our result relies on recent estimates on the heat semigroup and its derivative, that are valid if the negative part of the Ricci curvature is in the Kato class - so called Kato-Ricci manifolds.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the number of fixed points for circle actions on 10-dimensional almost complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a circle action on a compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, the lower bound on the number of fixed points is known in dimension up to 12 except 10. In this paper, we show that if the circle group acts on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, then there are at least 6 fixed points. This minimum is attained by $\mathbb{CP}^5$ and $S^6 \times \mathbb{CP}^2$. We establish this lower bound by showing that there does not exist a circle action on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with 4 fixed points.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the prescribed zero scalar curvature and mean curvature problem on the n-dimensional Euclidean ball for $n \geq 3$. Given a rotationally symmetric function $H:\partial B^{n}\rightarrow R$, in this work, we will prove that if $H'(r)$ changes signs where $H&gt;0$ and $H(r)$ also satisfies a flatness condition then there exists a metric $g$ conformal to the Euclidean metric, with zero scalar curvature in the ball and mean curvature $H$ on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Ancient Ricci flows of bounded girth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $n\ge 3$, we construct a 'pancake-like', $O(2)\times O(n-1)$-invariant ancient Ricci flow with positive curvature operator and bounded "girth", and we determine its asymptotic limits backwards in time. This solution is new even in dimension three. The construction hinges on the Ricci flow invariance of certain conditions on the curvature and its spatial derivatives under this symmetry regime, whose proof does not follow from Hamilton's tensor maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Flow: Shi-Type Estimates and Long-time Existence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the long-time existence of the anomaly flow on a compact complex $3$-fold with general slope parameter $\alpha'$. In particular, we obtain integral Shi-type estimates for the flow by adapting a integration-by-parts type argument instead of the usual maximum principle techniques. Following this, we prescribe a sufficient smallness condition on $\alpha'$ in order to extend the flow on $[0,\tau)$ to $[0,\tau + \epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>The dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by the method of curvature flows and obtained the existence of smooth even solutions. In addition, the smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem $w. r. t$ $q$-torsional rigidity were given by Zhao et al. \cite{ZX} through a Gauss curvature flow.
  The dual curvature measure and the dual Minkowski problem were first posed and considered by Huang, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang in \cite{HY}. The dual Minkowski problem is a very important problem, which has greatly contributed to the development of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory and extended the other types dual Minkowski problem.
  To the best of our knowledge, the dual Minkowski problem $w. r. t$ ($q$) torsional rigidity is still open because the dual ($q$) torsional measure is blank. Thus, it is a natural problem to consider the dual Minkowski problem for ($q$) torsional rigidity. In this paper, we introduce the $p$-th dual $q$-torsional measure by the variational method and propose the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$. Then we confirm the existence of smooth even solutions for $p&lt;n$ ($p\neq 0$) to the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity by method of a Gauss curvature flow. Specially, we also obtain the smooth non-even solutions with $p&lt;0$ to this problem.</description>

      <title>Basic curvature and the Atiyah cocycle in gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated from target space covariant formulations of topological sigma models and from a graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theory, we study connections on Lie and Courant algebroids and on their description as differential graded (dg) manifolds. We revisit the notion of basic curvature for a connection on a Lie algebroid, which measures its compatibility with the Lie bracket and it appears in the BV-BRST differential of 2D gauge theories such as (twisted) Poisson and Dirac sigma models. We define a basic curvature tensor for connections on Courant algebroids and we show that in the description of a Courant algebroid as a QP2 manifold it appears naturally as part of the homological vector field together with the Gualtieri torsion of an induced generalised connection. Furthermore, we consider connections on dg manifolds and revisit the structure of gauge transformations in the graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theories from a manifestly covariant perspective. We argue that it is governed by the brackets of a Kapranov L$_{\infty}[1]$ algebra, whose binary bracket is given by the Atiyah cocycle that measures the compatibility of the connection with the homological vector field. We also revisit some aspects of the derived bracket construction and show how to extend it to connections and tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study homological monodromy of a Lagrangian submanifold. First, we show that homological Lagrangian monodromy is trivial if Hofer energy of a Hamiltonian isotopy is smaller than the minimum energy of J-holomorphic spheres and discs. Next, we show that monodromy of Lagrangian Floer homology is trivial. The proof relies on a Morse or Floer theoretic approach to Wang exact sequence.</description>
