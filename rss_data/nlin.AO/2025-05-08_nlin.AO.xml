      <title>Tipping in an adaptive climate network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rising global temperatures Earth's tipping elements are becoming increasingly more vulnerable to crossing their critical thresholds. The reaching of such tipping points does not only impact other tipping elements through their connections, but can also have further effect on the global mean surface temperature (GMT) itself, either increasing or decreasing the probability of further tipping points being reached. Recently, a numerical study analyzing the risk of tipping cascades has been conducted, using a conceptual model describing the dynamics of a tipping element with its interactions with other tipping elements taken into account [1]. Here, we extend the model substantially by including adaptation, so that the GMT-feedback induced by the crossing of a tipping point is incorporated as well. We find that although the adaptive mechanism does not impact the risk for the occurrence of tipping events, large tipping cascades are less probable due to the negative GMT-feedback of the ocean circulation systems. Furthermore, several tipping elements can play a different role in cascades in the adaptive model. In particular, the Amazon rainforest could be a trigger in a tipping cascade. Overall, the adaptation mechanism tends to slightly stabilize the network.</description>

      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>

Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>

Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>
