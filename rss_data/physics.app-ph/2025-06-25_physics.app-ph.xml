      <title>Aluminium fast neutron leakage spectrum validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum is a crucial material in the nuclear industry, valued for its ability to perform reliably over time. The manuscript focuses on validating aluminum neutron transport libraries. The validation was conducted by activating samples in different positions, and measuring the fast neutron spectrum in the energy range of 0.1 MeV to 1.3 MeV by means of a proportional detector filled with hydrogen and, in the energy range of 1-12 MeV using a scintillation stilbene detector. Validation experiments were performed on the aluminium block with a central hole which was assembled from smaller aluminum plates. The dosimetric reactions studied for validation purposes were 58Ni(n,p)58Co, 197Au(n,g)198Au, 63Cu(n,g)64Cu, 181Ta(n,g)182Ta, 92Mo(n,p)92mNb, natTi(n,X)46Sc, and natTi(n,X)47Sc. All experimental data were compared to MCNP6.2 simulations using the ENDF/B-VIII.0, JEFF-3.3, and JENDL-5 neutron transport libraries. Activation cross sections were taken from IRDFF-II library. Concerning activation reactions results, unsatisfactory results are achieved for 197Au(n,g)198Au reaction regardless of thickness and library. All other results are reasonable regardless on library. JEFF-3.3 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 fast neutron flux calculations are similar.</description>

      <title>Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.</description>

      <title>Gear-based Metamaterials for Extraordinary Bandgap Tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials can be engineered with tunable bandgaps to adapt to dynamic and complex environments, particularly for controlling elastic waves and vibration. However, achieving wide-range, seamless, reversible, in-situ and robust tunability remains challenging and often impractical due to limitations in bandgap mechanisms and design principles. Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by 3-7 times (e.g. shifting from 250-430 Hz to 1400-2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in-situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.</description>

      <title>A novel plate-type phononic crystal for efficient vibration and noise attenuation performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating low-frequency vibration or noise is of vital importance to both human health and mechanical engineering. Two-dimensional phononic crystal (PC) structures were proposed by attaching rubber and metallic cylinders on one or both sides of a thin plate to attenuate low-frequency vibration via the local resonance mechanism. The finite element method was employed to evaluate the band structure and associated vibration modes of the proposed PC structures. It was found that the bandgap of the single-sided PC structure is narrower than that of the double-sided configuration. The formation mechanism of the flexural wave bandgap was analyzed based on the vibration modes. In particular, the influence of structural and material parameters on the band structure was systematically investigated. Finally, the accuracy of the calculated band structure and the effectiveness of the vibration and noise reduction performance were verified through simulations of vibration transmission characteristics and sound insulation curves. The results indicate that the proposed PC generates a relatively wide flexural wave bandgap in the low-frequency range, whose width and position can be flexibly tuned by adjusting structural and material parameters. These findings provide a novel approach for controlling low-frequency vibration and noise.</description>

      <title>Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials in Superconducting and Cryogenic Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers based on superconducting circuits faces critical challenges in qubit coherence, connectivity, and scalability. This review establishes metamaterials, artificial structures with on-demand electromagnetic properties, as a transformative solution. By engineering the photonic density of states, metamaterials can suppress decoherence via the Purcell effect and create multi-mode quantum buses for hardware-efficient control and long-range qubit coupling. We provide a comprehensive overview, from foundational principles and Hamiltonian engineering to the materials science of high-coherence devices. We survey state-of-the-art performance, highlighting record coherence times and coupling strengths achieved through metamaterial design. Furthermore, we explore advanced applications where engineered environments give rise to exotic excitations and topologically protected states, enabling novel error correction schemes and qubit architectures. Ultimately, we argue that metamaterials are evolving from passive components into the core architectural element of next-generation quantum technologies, paving a viable path toward scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of displacements with stabilized GKP states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how recent protocols developed for the stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states can be used for the estimation of two-quadrature displacement sensing, with sensitivities approaching the multivariate quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Thanks to the stabilization, this sensor is backaction evading and can function continuously without reset, making it well suited for the detection of itinerant signals. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations showing that the protocol can unconditionally surpass the Gaussian limit of displacement sensing with prior information, even in the presence of realistic noise. Our work shows how reservoir engineering in bosonic systems can be leveraged for quantum metrology, with potential applications in force sensing, waveform estimation and quantum channel learning.</description>

      <title>Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes at MHz frequencies. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5x10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for direct coupling to qubits or in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits or low-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger edge modes for water waves in linear and nonlinear regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates topologically protected edge modes in a water wave channel through a direct geometric mapping to the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By designing a periodic channel with alternating widths, we replicate the key features of the SSH model, leading to the emergence of robust zero-energy sloshing edge modes localized at the boundaries. Experimental data show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, supported by two-dimensional numerical simulations. In the nonlinear regime, two distinct bifurcations are observed, indicating the appearance of secondary resonances. This study highlights the relevance of the SSH model for water wave systems and provides an accessible method to explore topological edge states in classical wave systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</description>

      <title>Heliometric stereo: a new frontier in surface profilometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable measurements of three-dimensional surface structures are important for a broad range of technological and research applications, including materials science, nanotechnology, and biomedical research. Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) uses low-energy (64 meV) neutral helium atoms as the imaging probe particles, providing a highly sensitive and delicate approach to measuring surface topography. To date, topographic SHeM measurements have been largely qualitative, but with the advent of the heliometric stereo method - a technique that combines multiple images to create a 3D representation of a surface - quantitative maps of surface topography may now be acquired with SHeM. Here, we present and discuss two different implementations of heliometric stereo on two separate instruments, a single detector SHeM and a multiple-detector SHeM. Both implementations show good accuracy (5% and 10% respectively) for recovering the shape of a surface. Additionally, we discuss where heliometric stereo is most applicable, identify contrast features that can limit its accuracy, and discuss how to mitigate these limitations with careful design and sample choices that be readily implemented on current instruments.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>

Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>
