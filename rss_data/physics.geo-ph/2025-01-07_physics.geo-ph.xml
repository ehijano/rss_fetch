      <title>Vulnerability Liquefaction Mapping in Padang City Based on Cloud Computing Using Optical Satellite Imagery Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquefaction is a significant geological hazard in earthquake-prone locations like Padang City, Indonesia. The phenomenon happens when saturated soil loses strength owing to seismic shaking, resulting in substantial infrastructure damage. Accurate identification of sensitive locations is critical to catastrophe mitigation. This study aims to map water distribution using optical satellite data and estimate its importance as a crucial element in determining liquefaction vulnerability. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to assess water and vegetation indexes, taking advantage of its sensitivity to water content in varied land surfaces. We recommended using the NIR (near-infrared) and SWIR (short wave infrared) bands with 832.8 nm and 2202.4 nm, respectively, which are sensitive to soil water content. High-resolution satellite data were used to create NDWI maps, highlighting locations with high water saturation. These findings were combined with geological and seismic data to identify liquefaction-prone zones. The study found that locations with high water content, as measured by NDWI, are highly associated with greater liquefaction susceptibility. The findings highlight the importance of water distribution in determining soil behavior during seismic occurrences. This study highlights the value of NDWI as a low-cost and efficient tool for measuring liquefaction vulnerability at the regional level. The technique offers insights into Padang City's urban planning, catastrophe risk reduction, and community preparedness.</description>

      <title>A simulation study of the impact of fracture networks on the co-production of geothermal energy and lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-production of geothermal energy and lithium is an emerging opportunity with the potential to enhance the economic potential of geothermal operations. The economic reward of extracting lithium from geothermal brine is determined by how the lithium concentration evolves during brine production. In the initial stage, production will target lithium contained in the brine resident close to the production well. While lithium recharge, in the form of rock dissolution and inflow from other parts of the reservoir, is possible, the efficiency of such recharge depends on the geology of the reservoir. In this work, we study how structural heterogeneities in the form of fractures impact the flow of lithium-carrying brine. Using a numerical simulation tool that gives high resolution of flow and transport in fractures and the host rock, we study how the presence of fractures influences energy and lithium production. Our simulations show that, due to heat conduction and the lack of mineral recharge from the rock, differences in fracture network geometries have a much larger impact on lithium production than energy production. The simulations thus confirm that in addition to the geochemical characterisation of lithium in geothermal brines, understanding fracture characterisation and its impact on production is highly important for lithium production.</description>

      <title>Observations and Theoretical Calculations of 11-Year Cyclic Variations in Lower-Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations and quantitative understanding of spatio-temporary variations in lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature can provide fingerprints for the mechanisms of ozone depletion and play an important role in testing the impact of non-halogen greenhouse gases on the ozone layer in climate models. Here we report from ground-based ozonesonde and satellite-based measurements since the 1960s and 1979 respectively that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature display pronounced 11-year cyclic variations over Antarctica and mid-latitudes, while no apparent cyclic variations over the tropics. These observations were unexpected from the chemistry-climate models (CCMs) but predicted by the cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) model of ozone depletion. Remarkably, no-parameter CRE theoretical calculations give the ozone loss vertical profile in perfect agreement with observations at the Antarctic Syowa station and excellently reproduce time-series variations of both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature in all global regions. Furthermore, the large lower-stratospheric ozone depletion over the tropics in the 1980s and 1990s is also reproduced by CRE calculations. Moreover, CRE calculations exhibit complex phenomena in future trends of lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature, which are strongly affected by the future trends of cosmic-ray fluxes. The latter might even lead to almost no recovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica and no returning to the 1980 level over the tropics by 2100. The results also strikingly demonstrate that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature are controlled by cosmic rays and ozone-depleting substances only. This study greatly improves quantitative understanding of ozone depletion and climate in the global lower stratosphere and offers new predictions on future trends.</description>

      <title>Modeling measurements for quantitative imaging subsurface targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar measurements of scattering by targets located below a rough air-soil interface. By considering the inherent space/angle limitations of this imaging modality, we introduce a simplified model for measurements. This model assumes (i) first-order interactions between the target and the air-soil interface, (ii) scattering by the target below a flat air-soil interface, and (iii) a point target model. Using the method of fundamental solutions to simulate two-dimensional simulations of scalar waves for the direct scattering problem, we systematically study each of these data modeling assumptions. To test and validate these assumptions, we apply principal component analysis to approximately remove ground bounce signals from measurements and then apply Kirchhoff migration on that processed data to produce images. We show that images using this modeled data are nearly identical to those that use simulated measurements from the full direct scattering problem. In that way, we show that this model contains the essential information contained in measurements. Consequently, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding how inherent space/angle limitations affect subsurface imaging systems.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Effect in Earth's Dayside Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence and with matching temporal characteristics. During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Reconciling aging and slip state evolutions from laboratory-derived canons of rate-and-state friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aging law and the slip law are two representative evolution laws of the rate- and state-dependent friction (RSF) law, based on canonical behaviors in three types of laboratory experiments: slide-hold-slide (SHS), velocity-step (VS), and steady-state (SS) tests. The aging law explains the SHS canon but contradicts the VS canon, and vice versa for the slip law. The later proposed composite law, which switches these two laws according to the slip rate $V$, explains both canons but contradicts the SS canon. The present study constructs evolution laws satisfying all three canons throughout the range of variables where experiments have confirmed the canons. By recompiling the three canons, we have derived constraints on the evolution law and found that the evolution rates in the strengthening phases of the SHS and VS canons are so different that complete reconciliation throughout the entire range of variables is mathematically impossible. However, for the limited range of variables probed by experiments so far, we have found that the SHS and VS canons can be reconciled without violating the SS canon by switching the evolution function according to $\Omega$, the ratio of the state $\theta$ to its steady-state value $\theta_{\rm SS}$ for the instantaneous slip rate. We could generally show that, as long as the state evolution rate $\dot \theta$ depends only on the instantaneous values of $V$ and $\theta$, simultaneous reproduction of the three canons, throughout the experimentally confirmed range, requires the aging-law-like evolution for $\Omega$ sufficiently below a threshold $\beta$ and the slip-law-like evolution for $\Omega$ sufficiently above $\beta$. The validity of the canons in existing experiments suggests $\beta \lesssim 0.01$.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>

      <title>LASSE: Learning Active Sampling for Storm Tide Extremes in Non-Stationary Climate Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they "generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate 100% precision in retrieving rare destructive storms using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.</description>
