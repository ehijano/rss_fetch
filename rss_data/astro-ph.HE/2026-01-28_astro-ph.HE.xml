      <title>Energetic Ceilings of Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave (GWB) is limited by the amount of rest mass available to be converted into gravitational radiation. Here we derive a population-agnostic scaling law that places an absolute energetic ceiling on stochastic backgrounds across the entire GW frequency spectrum, from nanoHertz to kilohertz. We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1\sigma$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $\Omega_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.</description>

      <title>Induced Scattering of Fast Radio Bursts in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate induced Compton/Brillouin scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma by verifying kinetic theory with Particle-in-Cell simulations. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering--although suppressed by the magnetic field--inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>AT2018cow Powered by a Shock in Aspherical Circumstellar Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative model for the luminous fast blue optical transient AT2018cow in which a shock propagating through an aspherical circumstellar medium (CSM) produces the X-ray and UV/optical/NIR emission. X-rays are emitted from hot post-shock electrons, and soft X-ray photons are reprocessed into optical/UV emission in the cool downstream. This naturally explains two previously puzzling features: (i) the coordinated evolution of the optical and soft X-ray after day 20, (ii) the hard X-ray hump above 10 keV that disappears around day 15 as the Thomson optical depth transitions from $\tau_T \gg1$ to $\tau_T \sim 1$.
  Our model is over-constrained, and it quantitatively reproduces the bolometric luminosity evolution, soft X-ray spectrum, and time-dependent soft/hard X-ray and soft X-ray/optical luminosity ratios. It also explains additional puzzles: X-ray fluctuations with $\sim4-10$ day timescales arise from a global radiative shock instability, while the NIR excess and the apparent receding blackbody radius result from reprocessed X-rays in matter far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio is naturally explained as originating from a shock driven by the same ejecta in the more dilute CSM. The light curve steepening after $\sim 40$ days likely indicates the shock reaches the edge of the dense CSM at $\sim {\rm few} \times 10^{15}$ cm. We infer explosion energy $\sim 1-5 \times 10^{50}$ erg, carried by an ejecta at $\sim 0.1c$ and a mass of $0.01-0.05 M_\odot$, in a dense asymmetric CSM with $\sim 0.3 M_\odot$, embedded in a more dilute CSM.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Analysis of Six Luminous, Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiwavelength observations and analysis of six luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) discovered in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data. We identified these LFBOTs from their fast light-curve evolution ($t_{1/2}\leq 12 $d), blue colors at peak brightness ($g-r\leq-0.5 $mag), a visible host galaxy, high optical luminosity ($M_g&lt;-20$), and an X-ray or radio detection.
  With the exception of AT2024aehp (ZTF24abygbss), these transients exhibit peaks in their $10\,$GHz radio light curves at $t_{\text{rest}} \approx 50-100$ d, with peak radio luminosities ranging from $10^{38}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Modeling the radio emission as synchrotron radiation indicates a fast ($v=0.1-0.3c$) shock in a dense ($n_e\approx10^{3}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) medium. The X-ray emission varies by $\approx2$ orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at $t_{\text{rest}}\sim20 $d.
  Analysis of the host-galaxy photometry and spectroscopy for each transient shows that they are predominantly nonnuclear (a few kpc offset) with star-forming host galaxies of stellar masses $10^{9}-10^{11} ,M_\odot$.
  Unlike all other LFBOTs to date, AT2024aehp exhibited a luminous ($M&lt;-19 $mag) plateau in the optical light curve; spectra during this plateau phase showed a featureless blue continuum. The $6-15$ GHz radio emission of AT2024aehp brightened by over an order of magnitude from $t_{\text{rest}} \approx70 $d to $t_{\mathrm{rest}} \approx130 $d.
  The mostly consistent radio behavior between optically selected LFBOTs implies a similar circumburst medium, leading us to prefer a progenitor scenario in which mass is lost in a consistent way shortly prior to the terminal event, such as a massive star merging with a compact object.</description>

      <title>Progenitor of the recoiling super-massive black hole RBH-1 identified using HST/JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$~Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (``wet'') merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength view of the nearby Calcium-Strong Transient SN 2025coe in the X-Ray, Near-Infrared, and Radio Wavebands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium-strong transients (CaSTs) are a subclass of faint and rapidly evolving supernovae (SNe) that exhibit strong calcium features and notably weak oxygen features. The small but growing population of CaSTs exhibits some aspects similar to thermonuclear supernovae and others that are similar to massive star core-collapse events, leading to intriguing questions on the physical origins of CaSTs. SN 2025coe is one of the most nearby CaSTs discovered to date, and our coordinated multi-wavelength observations obtained days to weeks post-explosion reveal new insights on these enigmatic transients. With the most robust NIR spectroscopic time-series of a CaST collected to date, SN 2025coe shows spectral signatures characteristic of Type Ib SNe (SNe Ib, i.e. He-rich stripped-envelope SNe). SN~2025coe is the third X-ray detected CaST and our analysis of the \textit{Swift} X-ray data suggest interaction with 0.12 $\pm\,0.11\ M_{\odot}$ of circumstellar material (CSM) extending to at least $2 \times 10^{15} $cm ($\sim 30,000\ R_{\odot}$), while our analysis of the 1-240 GHz radio non-detections gives an outer radius of that CSM of at most $\sim 4\times 10^{15}$ cm. This inferred nearby high-density CSM extending out to $3\pm 1 \times10^{15}$ cm is similar to that seen in the other two X-ray detected CaSTs, and its presence suggests that either intensive mass-loss or some polluting mechanism may be a common feature of this subclass. Our work also expands upon recent studies on the optical properties of SN 2025coe and explores our current understanding of different progenitor systems that could possibly produce CaSTs.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles Accelerated in GRB Afterglow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</description>

      <title>Latent characterisation of the complete BATSE gamma ray bursts catalogue using Gaussian mixture of factor analysers and model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability.</description>

      <title>Constraining FRB Microstructure with Polarised Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FIRES, a polarised shot-noise framework that models fast radio burst (FRB) dynamic spectra as the incoherent superposition of Gaussian microshots. Applied to the CRAFT bursts FRB 20191001A and FRB 20240318A, FIRES reproduces key spectro-polarimetric behaviours: scattering suppresses position-angle (PA) variability on the trailing edge, while the leading edge preferentially retains intrinsic structure when sufficient signal-to-noise is present. We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\mathcal{R}_\psi$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $\Pi_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $\sigma_\psi$, and intrinsic linear fraction $\Pi_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB~20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $\sigma_\psi \sim 10^\circ$--$30^\circ$ and $N \sim 5$--$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB~20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($\sigma_\psi \sim 15$--$23^\circ$), depending on $\Pi_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs.</description>

      <title>STONKS first results: Long-term transients in the XMM-Newton Galactic plane survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of astronomical transients at high energies provides insights into some of the most extreme physical events in the universe; however, carrying out their detection and fast follow-up studies are limited by instrumental constraints. Search for Transient Object in New observations using Known Sources (STONKS) is a near-real-time transient detection system for XMM-Newton offering the capability to detect transients in XMM-Newton observations at fainter fluxes than can be achieved with wide survey instruments. We present the transients detected with the STONKS pipeline found in an XMM-Newton multi-year heritage survey of the Galactic plane to identify and classify highly variable X-ray sources that have recently been reported in this region. We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $\gamma$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations. It will enable the community to detect transient and highly variable sources at fainter fluxes than with any other X-ray transient detection systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with equal and near-equal mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of GW230529_181500 suggested the existence of more symmetric black hole-neutron star mergers where the black hole mass can be as low as 2.6 times that of the neutron star. Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \in \{1, 1/2, 1/3\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc.</description>

Abstract: The origin of accretion disc winds remains disputed to date. High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin.</description>

      <title>On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

      <title>Fading Echoes of Interaction: Probing Centuries of Mass-Loss in Four Old Type IIn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim4\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim2 \times 10^{-3}~\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\rm{\dot M&lt;2\times10^{-3}~M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Beyond FINDCHIRP: Breaking the memory wall and optimal FFTs for Gravitational-Wave Matched-Filter Searches with Ratio-Filter Dechirping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $&gt;10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Inside the cocoon: a comprehensive explanation of the spectra of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of compact galaxies in the early Universe with broad emission lines and strong Balmer breaks; among them the so-called ''little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature remains uncertain with hypotheses including exotic phenomena. We assemble a sample of LRD-like objects at $z&gt;3$ and use self-consistent radiative-transfer calculations to show that a supermassive black hole accreting from a dense gas cocoon accurately reproduces the detailed spectra. We show that the cocoons must be non-spherical, with comparable amounts of inflowing and outflowing material. And we predict correlations between Balmer break strength, Balmer line-absorption and scattering line width, which we confirm in our observed sample. We reproduce all LRD-like properties without requiring star-like atmospheres and we determine the typical black hole in our sample to be of order a million solar masses, with ionized cocoon masses of tens of solar masses potentially supplied from a much larger cold-gas reservoir.</description>

      <title>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part II. Weak instabilities and their resonant behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flavor instabilities in dense neutrino media trigger exponential growth of flavor waves, yet their nonlinear saturation remains poorly understood. We examine a simple proxy for this effect in the form of a single-wave solution of an axially symmetric fast flavor system. When the angular crossing is shallow and the growth rate of the instability correspondingly small, the flavor wave primarily affects resonant neutrinos that move in phase with it. The evolution of these resonant neutrinos becomes periodic, undergoing cycles of full flavor reversal. They feed power into the unstable wave, and subsequently return to their initial state, draining power back out. This new flavor pendulum captures the dynamics of weak, nearly monochromatic fast flavor instabilities. Since weakly unstable distributions always exhibit a narrow range of unstable wavenumbers, our model likely describes the earliest development of a flavor instability when it first appears. When the instability is not weak, the linear phase of a single-wave excitation does not connect to a regular nonlinear solution, unless the angle distribution consists of only two beams.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the consistent use of precessing, higher order multipole models for gravitational wave analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of gravitational-wave (GW) observations allows for constraints to be placed on the underlying population of black holes; current estimates show that black hole spins are small, with binaries more likely to have comparable component masses. Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated "worst-case" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\sim 20\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power.</description>

      <title>Energy partition in collisionless counterstreaming plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, counter-streaming plasma outflows drive magnetic field amplification, plasma heating, and particle acceleration in numerous astrophysical environments, from supernova remnant shocks to active galactic nuclei jets. Understanding how, in the absence of Coulomb collisions, energy is redistributed between the different plasma species remains a fundamental open question. We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. For electron-proton flows, the electron thermal energy only reaches up to a few percent of the initial ion kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Spiral Density Waves and Torque Balance in the Kerr Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs are a key science target for the upcoming LISA mission. Existing models of disc-EMRI interactions typically rely on crude dynamical friction or Newtonian planetary migration prescriptions, which fail to capture the relativistic fluid response induced by the binary potential. In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Formalism for Impurity-Induced Resonances in Sub-barrier Proton-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from Galactic Diffuse Synchrotron Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of constraining primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$ through Galactic diffuse synchrotron emissions. Due to Hawking radiation, these types of PBHs are expected to be stable sources of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons with energies below $\mathcal{O}(10\,\mathrm{MeV})$. In many CR propagation models with diffusive re-acceleration characterized by a significant Alfv\'{e}n velocity $V_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{km/s}$, the energies of the evaporated electrons/positrons can be further enhanced to $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{MeV}$ through their scattering with the Galactic random magnetic fields. Consequently, the observation of Galactic synchrotron emissions at frequencies above $\sim 20\,\mathrm{MHz}$ can provide useful constraints on the abundance of PBHs. Using the AMS-02 and Voyager-1 data on the boron-to-carbon nuclei flux ratio, we confirm that a significant Alfv\'{e}n velocity $V_a \sim 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$ is favored in several benchmark diffusive re-acceleration models. We show that, in this scenario, the observed low-frequency synchrotron emissions (from 22 MHz to 1.4 GHz) can provide stringent constraints on PBH abundance. The obtained conservative constraints are stronger than those derived from the Voyager-1 all-electron (electron plus positron) data by more than one order of magnitude for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$, and also stronger than our previous constraints derived from the AMS-02 positron data for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 2\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-metricity provides a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, yet its experimental signatures remain largely unexplored. In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and observational properties of weakly Proca-charged black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_{\gamma}&lt;10^{-48}\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $\mu \leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 &lt; \mathrm{Q} &lt; 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Highly Asymmetric Neutron-Star Matter from Liquid Drop Model and Meson Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified description of dense matter and neutron-star structure based on simple but physically motivated models. Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $\beta$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</description>

      <title>A sudden dramatic change and recovery of magneto-environment of a repeating fast radio burst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or binary configuration. We report an abrupt magneto-ionic variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift $0.1839 \pm 0.0001$. Initially, the Faraday rotation measure (RM) had a median of $17~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ and a scatter of $101~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1977 \pm 84~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, and returned to typical values within two weeks. This drastic RM variation suggests that a dense magnetized clump enters and exits the line of sight in week timescales. One plausible scenario invokes a coronal mass ejection from a companion star, while other scenarios invoking extreme turbulence or binary orbital motion are also possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars as compared to purely nucleonic systems. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation $R(M)$ is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass \lambda(M) points to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M) and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative to the maximum mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.</description>

      <title>Convection signatures in early-time gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers.
  This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star.
  We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results.
  Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a nearby massive galaxy cluster that spans several degrees. We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond, although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of the X-ray sky background and foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn, serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma.
  Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a "snake biting its tail". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system might be important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines. In this work, we analyze a sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations ($T_{50}$, $T_{90}$), and moderate positive correlations with peak photon flux proxies ($P_{pk1}$--$P_{pk3}$). By contrast, the standard spectral parameters (including the low-energy index $\alpha$) show no evidence for a linear dependence on the Hurst index in our sample. We do not find a clear monotonic weakening of the correlation strength from 64 ms to 1024 ms peak-flux measures; rather, the correlation coefficients for $P_{pk1}$--$P_{pk3}$ are comparable within uncertainties. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining black hole spin in PG 1535+547 amidst complex multi-layered absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\Gamma\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R&gt;7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a&gt;0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of the interstellar medium associated with the two middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) W41 and G22.7-0.2, both detected in TeV gamma-rays. Using high-angular-resolution $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) data from the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and HI data from the VLA, we investigated the spatial and kinematic properties of molecular and atomic gas that interact with the SNRs. We identified associated clouds in the velocity ranges of +50-+80 km s$^{-1}$ for W41 and +76-+110 km s$^{-1}$ for G22.7-0.2. Column density analysis indicates that target protons are dominated by molecular hydrogen, while atomic hydrogen contributes less than $\sim$10-15% even after correction for self-absorption. The mean proton densities are $\sim$1.2$\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for W41 and $\sim$5.3$\times$10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for G22.7-0.2. From the gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total energy of accelerated cosmic-ray protons as $W_\mathrm{p}$ $\sim$3$\times$10$^{47}$~erg for W41 and $\sim$1$\times$10$^{48}$ erg for G22.7-0.2, corresponding to 0.03-0.1% of the canonical supernova explosion energy. hese $W_\mathrm{p}$ values agree with the decreasing trend in $W_\mathrm{p}$ observed in the middle-aged SNRs within the previously reported SNR age-$W_\mathrm{p}$ relation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the neutron star-black hole merger rate</title>

Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. Current searches may therefore miss a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. When focusing on a potentially precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers, the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. We then show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the overall rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nuclei do not exhibit strictly sinusoidal brightness variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on apparently stable sinusoidal variability in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic and sinusoidal AGN variability is exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting it on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple sinusoidal periodicity.</description>

      <title>Decaying vector dark matter with low reheating temperature for KM3NeT signal and its impact on gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

      <title>A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational-wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>
