      <title>Multidimensional Territorial Attractiveness: an Application to European Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Regional Economics, the attractiveness of regions for capital, migrants, tourists, and other kinds of flows is a relevant topic. Usually, studies in this field have mainly explored single flows, characterizing the dimensions of territorial attractiveness separately, rarely considering the interwoven effect of flows. Here we investigate attractiveness from a multi-dimensional perspective (i.e., dealing with different flows), asking how various types of regional flows collectively shape the attractiveness dynamics of European regions. We analyze eight distinct flow types across NUTS2 regions from 2010 to 2018, employing a multilayer network approach. Notably, the multilayer approach unveils insights that would be missed in single-layer analyses. Community detection reveals complex structures that demonstrate the cohesive power of national borders and the existence of strong cross-border ties in specific regions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of regional attractiveness, with implications for targeted policy interventions in regional development and European cohesion.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Letters of Recommendation in Astronomy and Astrophysics Graduate Admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Letters of recommendation are a common tool used in graduate admissions. Most admissions systems require three letters for each applicant, burdening both letter writers and admissions committees with a heavy work load that may not be time well-spent. Most applicants do not have three research advisors who can comment meaningfully on research readiness, adding a large number of letters that are not useful. Ideally, letters of recommendation will showcase the students' promise for a research career, but in practice, the letters often do not fulfill this purpose.
  As a group of early and mid-career faculty who write dozens of letters every year for promising undergraduates, we are concerned and overburdened by the inefficiencies of the current system. In this open letter to the AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force, we offer an alternative to the current use of letters of recommendation: a portfolio submitted by the student, which highlights e.g., a paper, plot, or presentation that represents their past work and readiness for grad school, uploaded to a centralized system used by astronomy and astrophysics PhD programs. While we argue that we could eliminate letters in this new paradigm, it may instead be advisable to limit the number of letters of recommendation to one per applicant.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional covariance matrix estimators on simulated portfolios with complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the allocation of synthetic portfolios under hierarchical nested, one-factor, and diagonal structures of the population covariance matrix in a high-dimensional scenario. The noise reduction approaches for the sample realizations are based on random matrices, free probability, deterministic equivalents, and their combination with a data science hierarchical method known as two-step covariance estimators. The financial performance metrics from the simulations are compared with empirical data from companies comprising the S&amp;P 500 index using a moving window and walk-forward analysis. The portfolio allocation strategies analyzed include the minimum variance portfolio (both with and without short-selling constraints) and the hierarchical risk parity approach. Our proposed hierarchical nested covariance model shows signatures of complex system interactions. The empirical financial data reproduces stylized portfolio facts observed in the complex and one-factor covariance models. The two-step estimators proposed here improve several financial metrics under the analyzed investment strategies. The results pave the way for new risk management and diversification approaches when the number of assets is of the same order as the number of transaction days in the investment portfolio.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in pandemic spread and fractal containment policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although pandemics are often studied as if populations are well-mixed, disease transmission networks exhibit a multi-scale structure stretching from the individual all the way up to the entire globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an intense debate about whether interventions should prioritize public health or the economy, leading to a surge of studies analyzing the health and economic costs of various response strategies. Here we show that describing disease transmission in a self-similar (fractal) manner across multiple geographic scales allows for the design of multi-scale containment measures that substantially reduce both these costs. We characterize response strategies using multi-scale reproduction numbers -- a generalization of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ -- that describe pandemic spread at multiple levels of scale and provide robust upper bounds on disease transmission. Stable elimination is guaranteed if there exists a scale such that the reproduction number among regions of that scale is less than $1$, even if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is greater than $1$. We support our theoretical results using simulations of a heterogeneous SIS model for disease spread in the United States constructed using county-level commuting, air travel, and population data.</description>
