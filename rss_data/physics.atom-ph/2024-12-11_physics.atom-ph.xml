      <title>Atomic-optical interferometry in fractured loops: a general solution for Rydberg radio frequency receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07632v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>

      <title>Control, competition and coexistence of effective magnetic orders by interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates with high-Q cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atom systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</description>

      <title>High-ellipticity resonant below-threshold harmonic generation by a helium atom driven by a moderately intense elliptically polarized laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The below-threshold harmonic generation in the multiphoton ionization regime for a helium atom driven by the elliptically polarized laser field is studied numerically within the framework of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models. It is shown that, regardless of the specific type of atomic potential and the model dimensionality, there is a set of laser frequencies, at which the harmonic generation efficiency increases dramatically with a simultaneous increase of their ellipticity. In these cases, the harmonic ellipticity can exceed the laser ellipticity by 2 or more times in absolute value. It is shown that the efficiency of harmonic generation in this interaction regime depends weakly or almost does not depend on the laser ellipticity. The pathways leading to resonant emission of intense harmonics with increased ellipticities are identified. The enhancement of the ellipticity of these harmonics is explained in terms of relative probabilities of resonant transitions in an elliptically polarized laser field for different values of the magnetic quantum number.</description>

      <title>Lattice Bose polarons at strong coupling and quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical framework for exploring a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a highly correlated bath of bosons in the quantum critical regime of a Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) quantum phase transition. Our framework is based on a powerful quantum Gutzwiller (QGW) description of the bosonic bath combined with diagrammatic field theory for the impurity-bath interactions. By resumming a selected class of diagrams to infinite order, a rich picture emerges where the impurity is dressed by the fundamental modes of the bath, which change character from gapped particle-hole excitations in the MI to Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes in the SF. This gives rise to the existence of several quasiparticle (polaron) branches with properties reflecting the strongly correlated environment. In particular, one polaron branch exhibits a sharp cusp in its energy, while a new ground-state polaron emerges at the $O(2)$ quantum phase transition point for integer filling, which reflects the nonanalytic behavior at the transition and the appearance of the Goldstone mode in the SF phase. Smooth versions of these features are inherited in the polaron spectrum away from integer filling because of the varying ``Mottness" of the bosonic bath. We furthermore compare our diagrammatic results with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, obtaining excellent agreement. This accuracy is quite remarkable for such a highly non-trivial case of strong interactions between the impurity and bosons in a maximally correlated quantum critical regime, and it establishes the utility of our framework. Finally, our results show how impurities can be used as quantum sensors and highlight fundamental differences between experiments performed at a fixed particle number or a fixed chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Isolating Pure Quadratic Zeeman Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetic interactions provide access to complex quantum spin dynamics and thus enable the study of intriguing physical phenomena. However, these interactions are often dominated by the linear Zeeman effect, which can complicate system dynamics and make their analysis more challenging. In this article, we theoretically and experimentally introduce a method to induce the quadratic Zeeman effect while effectively compensating for its linear counterpart. By isolating the quadratic Zeeman contributions, we demonstrate and analyze controlled superposition generation between specific magnetic sublevels in room-temperature rubidium-87 atoms. This study opens avenues for controlling any spin system, regardless of its total angular momentum, which we plan to explore further in the context of quantum-state tomography and engineering (e.g., spin squeezing).</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Operation and Materials Science with Neutral Atom Logical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the fault-tolerant operation of logical qubits on a neutral atom quantum computer, with logical performance surpassing physical performance for multiple circuits including Bell states (12x error reduction), random circuits (15x), and a prototype Anderson Impurity Model ground state solver for materials science applications (up to 6x, non-fault-tolerantly). The logical qubits are implemented via the [[4, 2, 2]] code (C4). Our work constitutes the first complete realization of the benchmarking protocol proposed by Gottesman 2016 [1] demonstrating results consistent with fault-tolerance. In light of recent advances on applying concatenated C4/C6 detection codes to achieve error correction with high code rates and thresholds, our work can be regarded as a building block towards a practical scheme for fault tolerant quantum computation. Our demonstration of a materials science application with logical qubits particularly demonstrates the immediate value of these techniques on current experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for low-noise detection of atoms using resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy in cold atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy has been previously used as a highly-sensitive method for measuring the output of cold atom interferometers. Using a detailed model that accounts for optical saturation, laser intensities and atomic densities that vary spatially, and radiation pressure on the atoms, we theoretically investigate under what parameter regimes the optimum signal-to-noise ratio is found under experimentally realistic conditions. We compare this technique to the standard method of fluorescence imaging and find that it outperforms fluorescence imaging for compact interferometers using condensed atomic sources or where the photon collection efficiency is limited. However, we find that fluorescence imaging is likely to be the preferred method when using squeezed atomic sources due to limited atom number.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Inverse Turbulent-Wave Cascade in a Driven Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate, we drive the gas isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size, and observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution. At lengthscales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we reveal the complete qualitative picture of how the steady-state cascade forms.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven method to discover the latent space and learn the corresponding latent dynamics for a collisional-radiative (CR) model in radiative plasma simulations. The CR model, consisting of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), must be solved at each grid point in the configuration space, leading to significant computational costs in plasma simulations. Our method employs a physics-assisted autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional latent representation of the original CR system. A flow map neural network is then used to learn the latent dynamics. Once trained, the reduced surrogate model predicts the entire latent dynamics given only the initial condition by iteratively applying the flow map. The radiative power loss is then reconstructed using a decoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the radiative power loss rate.</description>
