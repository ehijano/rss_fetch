      <title>Learning Latent Space Dynamics with Model-Form Uncertainties: A Stochastic Reduced-Order Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to represent and quantify model-form uncertainties in the reduced-order modeling of complex systems using operator inference techniques. Such uncertainties can arise in the selection of an appropriate state-space representation, in the projection step that underlies many reduced-order modeling methods, or as a byproduct of considerations made during training, to name a few. Following previous works in the literature, the proposed method captures these uncertainties by expanding the approximation space through the randomization of the projection matrix. This is achieved by combining Riemannian projection and retraction operators - acting on a subset of the Stiefel manifold - with an information-theoretic formulation. The efficacy of the approach is assessed on canonical problems in fluid mechanics by identifying and quantifying the impact of model-form uncertainties on the inferred operators.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Combinatorial Bandits for Budget Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's top advertisers typically manage hundreds of campaigns simultaneously and consistently launch new ones throughout the year. A crucial challenge for marketing managers is determining the optimal allocation of limited budgets across various ad lines in each campaign to maximize cumulative returns, especially given the huge uncertainty in return outcomes. In this paper, we propose to formulate budget allocation as a multi-task combinatorial bandit problem and introduce a novel online budget allocation system. The proposed system: i) integrates a Bayesian hierarchical model to intelligently utilize the metadata of campaigns and ad lines and budget size, ensuring efficient information sharing; ii) provides the flexibility to incorporate diverse modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Gaussian Processes, and Neural Networks, catering to diverse environmental complexities; and iii) employs the Thompson sampling (TS) technique to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. Through offline evaluation and online experiments, our system demonstrates robustness and adaptability, effectively maximizing the overall cumulative returns. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MCMAB.</description>

      <title>On the optimal approximation of Sobolev and Besov functions using deep ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of how efficiently functions in the Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{s,q}([0,1]^d)$ and Besov spaces $\mathcal{B}^s_{q,r}([0,1]^d)$ can be approximated by deep ReLU neural networks with width $W$ and depth $L$, when the error is measured in the $L^p([0,1]^d)$ norm. This problem has been studied by several recent works, which obtained the approximation rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ up to logarithmic factors when $p=q=\infty$, and the rate $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2s/d})$ for networks with fixed width when the Sobolev embedding condition $1/q -1/p&lt;s/d$ holds. We generalize these results by showing that the rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ indeed holds under the Sobolev embedding condition. It is known that this rate is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The key tool in our proof is a novel encoding of sparse vectors by using deep ReLU neural networks with varied width and depth, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>EnsLoss: Stochastic Calibrated Loss Ensembles for Preventing Overfitting in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00908v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) with a computationally feasible surrogate loss is a widely accepted approach for classification. Notably, the convexity and calibration (CC) properties of a loss function ensure consistency of ERM in maximizing accuracy, thereby offering a wide range of options for surrogate losses. In this article, we propose a novel ensemble method, namely EnsLoss, which extends the ensemble learning concept to combine loss functions within the ERM framework. A key feature of our method is the consideration on preserving the "legitimacy" of the combined losses, i.e., ensuring the CC properties. Specifically, we first transform the CC conditions of losses into loss-derivatives, thereby bypassing the need for explicit loss functions and directly generating calibrated loss-derivatives. Therefore, inspired by Dropout, EnsLoss enables loss ensembles through one training process with doubly stochastic gradient descent (i.e., random batch samples and random calibrated loss-derivatives). We theoretically establish the statistical consistency of our approach and provide insights into its benefits. The numerical effectiveness of EnsLoss compared to fixed loss methods is demonstrated through experiments on a broad range of 14 OpenML tabular datasets and 46 image datasets with various deep learning architectures. Python repository and source code are available on GitHub at https://github.com/statmlben/ensloss.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap SGD: Algorithmic Stability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper some methods to use the empirical bootstrap approach for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the empirical risk over a separable Hilbert space are investigated from the view point of algorithmic stability and statistical robustness. The first two types of approaches are based on averages and are investigated from a theoretical point of view. A generalization analysis for bootstrap SGD of Type 1 and Type 2 based on algorithmic stability is done. Another type of bootstrap SGD is proposed to demonstrate that it is possible to construct purely distribution-free pointwise confidence intervals of the median curve using bootstrap SGD.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) method, which constructs exact, non-asymptotic confidence regions for the true system parameters under mild statistical assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. The standard version of SPS deals with linear regression problems, however, it can be generalized to stochastic linear (dynamical) systems, even with closed-loop setups, and to nonlinear and nonparametric problems, as well. Although the strong consistency of the method was rigorously proven, the sample complexity of the algorithm was only analyzed so far for scalar linear regression problems. In this paper we study the sample complexity of SPS for general linear regression problems. We establish high probability upper bounds for the diameters of SPS confidence regions for finite sample sizes and show that the SPS regions shrink at the same, optimal rate as the classical asymptotic confidence ellipsoids. Finally, the difference between the theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of SPS confidence regions is investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>Stein transport for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Stein transport}$, a novel methodology for Bayesian inference designed to efficiently push an ensemble of particles along a predefined curve of tempered probability distributions. The driving vector field is chosen from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can be derived either through a suitable kernel ridge regression formulation or as an infinitesimal optimal transport map in the Stein geometry. The update equations of Stein transport resemble those of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), but introduce a time-varying score function as well as specific weights attached to the particles. While SVGD relies on convergence in the long-time limit, Stein transport reaches its posterior approximation at finite time $t=1$. Studying the mean-field limit, we discuss the errors incurred by regularisation and finite-particle effects, and we connect Stein transport to birth-death dynamics and Fisher-Rao gradient flows. In a series of experiments, we show that in comparison to SVGD, Stein transport not only often reaches more accurate posterior approximations with a significantly reduced computational budget, but that it also effectively mitigates the variance collapse phenomenon commonly observed in SVGD.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of Persistent Homology with Neural Networks for Time-Series Prediction: A Case Study in Wave Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series prediction is an active area of research across various fields, often challenged by the fluctuating influence of short-term and long-term factors. In this study, we introduce a feature engineering method that enhances the predictive performance of neural network models. Specifically, we leverage computational topology techniques to derive valuable topological features from input data, boosting the predictive accuracy of our models. Our focus is on predicting wave heights, utilizing models based on topological features within feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and RNNs with gated recurrent units (GRU). For time-ahead predictions, the enhancements in $R^2$ score were significant for FNNs, RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models. Additionally, these models also showed significant reductions in maximum errors and mean squared errors.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Robust Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase retrieval problem in the presence of noise aims to recover the signal vector of interest from a set of quadratic measurements with infrequent but arbitrary corruptions, and it plays an important role in many scientific applications. However, the essential geometric structure of the nonconvex robust phase retrieval based on the $\ell_1$-loss is largely unknown to study spurious local solutions, even under the ideal noiseless setting, and its intrinsic nonsmooth nature also impacts the efficiency of optimization algorithms. This paper introduces the smoothed robust phase retrieval (SRPR) based on a family of convolution-type smoothed loss functions. Theoretically, we prove that the SRPR enjoys a benign geometric structure with high probability: (1) under the noiseless situation, the SRPR has no spurious local solutions, and the target signals are global solutions, and (2) under the infrequent but arbitrary corruptions, we characterize the stationary points of the SRPR and prove its benign landscape, which is the first landscape analysis of phase retrieval with corruption in the literature. Moreover, we prove the local linear convergence rate of gradient descent for solving the SRPR under the noiseless situation. Experiments on both simulated datasets and image recovery are provided to demonstrate the numerical performance of the SRPR.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graphon is the limit of a converging graph sequence. Graphons of dense graphs are useful as they can act as a blueprint and generate graphs of arbitrary size with similar properties. But for sparse graphs this is not the case. Sparse graphs converge to the zero graphon, making the generated graphs empty or edgeless. Thus, the classical graphon definition fails for sparse graphs. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation and to understand sparse graphs more deeply. However, the fragile nature of sparse graphs makes these methods mathematically complex. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a certain subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. Line graphs map edges to vertices and connects edges when edges in the original graph share a vertex. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>A sparse PAC-Bayesian approach for high-dimensional quantile prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantile regression, a robust method for estimating conditional quantiles, has advanced significantly in fields such as econometrics, statistics, and machine learning. In high-dimensional settings, where the number of covariates exceeds sample size, penalized methods like lasso have been developed to address sparsity challenges. Bayesian methods, initially connected to quantile regression via the asymmetric Laplace likelihood, have also evolved, though issues with posterior variance have led to new approaches, including pseudo/score likelihoods. This paper presents a novel probabilistic machine learning approach for high-dimensional quantile prediction. It uses a pseudo-Bayesian framework with a scaled Student-t prior and Langevin Monte Carlo for efficient computation. The method demonstrates strong theoretical guarantees, through PAC-Bayes bounds, that establish non-asymptotic oracle inequalities, showing minimax-optimal prediction error and adaptability to unknown sparsity. Its effectiveness is validated through simulations and real-world data, where it performs competitively against established frequentist and Bayesian techniques.</description>

      <title>Deep non-parametric logistic model with case-control data and external summary information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The case-control sampling design serves as a pivotal strategy in mitigating the imbalanced structure observed in binary data. We consider the estimation of a non-parametric logistic model with the case-control data supplemented by external summary information. The incorporation of external summary information ensures the identifiability of the model. We propose a two-step estimation procedure. In the first step, the external information is utilized to estimate the marginal case proportion. In the second step, the estimated proportion is used to construct a weighted objective function for parameter training. A deep neural network architecture is employed for functional approximation. We further derive the non-asymptotic error bound of the proposed estimator. Following this the convergence rate is obtained and is shown to reach the optimal speed of the non-parametric regression estimation. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the theoretical findings of the proposed method. A real data example is analyzed for illustration.</description>

      <title>Beyond Unconstrained Features: Neural Collapse for Shallow Neural Networks with General Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural collapse (NC) is a phenomenon that emerges at the terminal phase of the training (TPT) of deep neural networks (DNNs). The features of the data in the same class collapse to their respective sample means and the sample means exhibit a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). In the past few years, there has been a surge of works that focus on explaining why the NC occurs and how it affects generalization. Since the DNNs are notoriously difficult to analyze, most works mainly focus on the unconstrained feature model (UFM). While the UFM explains the NC to some extent, it fails to provide a complete picture of how the network architecture and the dataset affect NC. In this work, we focus on shallow ReLU neural networks and try to understand how the width, depth, data dimension, and statistical property of the training dataset influence the neural collapse. We provide a complete characterization of when the NC occurs for two or three-layer neural networks. For two-layer ReLU neural networks, a sufficient condition on when the global minimizer of the regularized empirical risk function exhibits the NC configuration depends on the data dimension, sample size, and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data instead of the network width. For three-layer neural networks, we show that the NC occurs as long as the first layer is sufficiently wide. Regarding the connection between NC and generalization, we show the generalization heavily depends on the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) in the data: even if the NC occurs, the generalization can still be bad provided that the SNR in the data is too low. Our results significantly extend the state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of the N C under the UFM by characterizing the emergence of the N C under shallow nonlinear networks and showing how it depends on data properties and network architecture.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: Unknown Noise level Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution, and ii) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the distribution. The first class of methods is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning, and the second class is often impractical, as the noise level is generally unknown in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of historical data from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scintillation monitoring receivers to predict the severity of amplitude scintillation, a phenomenon where electron density irregularities in the ionosphere cause fluctuations in GNSS signal power. These fluctuations can be measured using the S4 index, but real-time data is not always available. The research focuses on developing a machine learning (ML) model that can forecast the intensity of amplitude scintillation, categorizing it into low, medium, or high severity levels based on various time and space-related factors. Among six different ML models tested, the XGBoost model emerged as the most effective, demonstrating a remarkable 77% prediction accuracy when trained with a balanced dataset. This work underscores the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing the reliability and performance of GNSS signals and navigation systems by accurately predicting amplitude scintillation severity.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Spatial Interpolation: Merging Data-driven with Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00125v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating spatially distributed information through the interpolation of scattered observation datasets often overlooks the critical role of domain knowledge in understanding spatial dependencies. Additionally, the features of these data sets are typically limited to the spatial coordinates of the scattered observation locations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates data-driven spatial dependency feature extraction with rule-assisted spatial dependency function mapping to augment domain knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in two comparative application scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture more localized spatial features in the reconstructed distribution fields. Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets. Our framework introduces an innovative approach to spatial information estimation by synergistically combining observational data with rule-assisted domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Latent-EnSF: A Latent Ensemble Score Filter for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation with Sparse Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling and prediction of complex physical systems often rely on data assimilation techniques to correct errors inherent in model simulations. Traditional methods like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants as well as the recently developed Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) face significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear Bayesian filtering problems with sparse observations, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data assimilation method, Latent-EnSF, which leverages EnSF with efficient and consistent latent representations of the full states and sparse observations to address the joint challenges of high dimensionlity in states and high sparsity in observations for nonlinear Bayesian filtering. We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network-based lithium-ion battery state of health estimation using partial discharging curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have gained extensive attention in estimating the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries. Accurate SOH estimation requires degradation-relevant features and alignment of statistical distributions between training and testing datasets. However, current research often overlooks these needs and relies on arbitrary voltage segment selection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach leveraging spatio-temporal degradation dynamics via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our method systematically selects discharge voltage segments using the Matrix Profile anomaly detection algorithm, eliminating the need for manual selection and preventing information loss. These selected segments form a fundamental structure integrated into the GCN-based SOH estimation model, capturing inter-cycle dynamics and mitigating statistical distribution incongruities between offline training and online testing data. Validation with a widely accepted open-source dataset demonstrates that our method achieves precise SOH estimation, with a root mean squared error of less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Inference, interference and invariance: How the Quantum Fourier Transform can help to learn from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we take inspiration from a typical quantum algorithm to design heuristics for machine learning? A common blueprint, used from Deutsch-Josza to Shor's algorithm, is to place labeled information in superposition via an oracle, interfere in Fourier space, and measure. In this paper, we want to understand how this interference strategy can be used for inference, i.e. to generalize from finite data samples to a ground truth. Our investigative framework is built around the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP), which we transform into a learning task by replacing the oracle with classical training data. The standard quantum algorithm for solving the HSP uses the Quantum Fourier Transform to expose an invariant subspace, i.e., a subset of Hilbert space in which the hidden symmetry is manifest. Based on this insight, we propose an inference principle that "compares" the data to this invariant subspace, and suggest a concrete implementation via overlaps of quantum states. We hope that this leads to well-motivated quantum heuristics that can leverage symmetries for machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>On Expressive Power of Quantized Neural Networks under Fixed-Point Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into the expressive power of neural networks typically considers real parameters and operations without rounding error. In this work, we study universal approximation property of quantized networks under discrete fixed-point parameters and fixed-point operations that may incur errors due to rounding. We first provide a necessary condition and a sufficient condition on fixed-point arithmetic and activation functions for universal approximation of quantized networks. Then, we show that various popular activation functions satisfy our sufficient condition, e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU, ELU, SoftPlus, SiLU, Mish, and GELU. In other words, networks using those activation functions are capable of universal approximation. We further show that our necessary condition and sufficient condition coincide under a mild condition on activation functions: e.g., for an activation function $\sigma$, there exists a fixed-point number $x$ such that $\sigma(x)=0$. Namely, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for a large class of activation functions. We lastly show that even quantized networks using binary weights in $\{-1,1\}$ can also universally approximate for practical activation functions.</description>

      <title>Data is missing again -- Reconstruction of power generation data using $k$-Nearest Neighbors and spectral graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The risk of missing data and subsequent incomplete data records at wind farms increases with the number of turbines and sensors. We propose here an imputation method that blends data-driven concepts with expert knowledge, by using the geometry of the wind farm in order to provide better estimates when performing Nearest Neighbor imputation. Our method relies on learning Laplacian eigenmaps out of the graph of the wind farm through spectral graph theory. These learned representations can be based on the wind farm layout only, or additionally account for information provided by collected data. The related weighted graph is allowed to change with time and can be tracked in an online fashion. Application to the Westermost Rough offshore wind farm shows significant improvement over approaches that do not account for the wind farm layout information.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Multivariate Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), the consideration of multivariate reward signals has led to fundamental advancements in multi-objective decision-making, transfer learning, and representation learning. This work introduces the first oracle-free and computationally-tractable algorithms for provably convergent multivariate distributional dynamic programming and temporal difference learning. Our convergence rates match the familiar rates in the scalar reward setting, and additionally provide new insights into the fidelity of approximate return distribution representations as a function of the reward dimension. Surprisingly, when the reward dimension is larger than $1$, we show that standard analysis of categorical TD learning fails, which we resolve with a novel projection onto the space of mass-$1$ signed measures. Finally, with the aid of our technical results and simulations, we identify tradeoffs between distribution representations that influence the performance of multivariate distributional RL in practice.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Prosumer Networks for Peak Load Management in Iran: A Distributed Contextual Stochastic Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable prosumers face the complex challenge of balancing self-sufficiency with seamless grid and market integration. This paper introduces a novel prosumers network framework aimed at mitigating peak loads in Iran, particularly under the uncertainties inherent in renewable energy generation and demand. A cost-oriented integrated prediction and optimization approach is proposed, empowering prosumers to make informed decisions within a distributed contextual stochastic optimization (DCSO) framework. The problem is formulated as a bi-level two-stage multi-time scale optimization to determine optimal operation and interaction strategies under various scenarios, considering flexible resources. To facilitate grid integration, a novel consensus-based contextual information sharing mechanism is proposed. This approach enables coordinated collective behaviors and leverages contextual data more effectively. The overall problem is recast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by incorporating optimality conditions and linearizing complementarity constraints. Additionally, a distributed algorithm using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented for computational tractability and privacy preservation. Numerical results highlights that integrating prediction with optimization and implementing a contextual information-sharing network among prosumers significantly reduces peak loads as well as total costs.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models-Enabled Digital Twins for Precision Medicine in Rare Gynecological Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare gynecological tumors (RGTs) present major clinical challenges due to their low incidence and heterogeneity. The lack of clear guidelines leads to suboptimal management and poor prognosis. Molecular tumor boards accelerate access to effective therapies by tailoring treatment based on biomarkers, beyond cancer type. Unstructured data that requires manual curation hinders efficient use of biomarker profiling for therapy matching. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to construct digital twins for precision medicine in RGTs.
  Our proof-of-concept digital twin system integrates clinical and biomarker data from institutional and published cases (n=21) and literature-derived data (n=655 publications with n=404,265 patients) to create tailored treatment plans for metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, identifying options potentially missed by traditional, single-source analysis. LLM-enabled digital twins efficiently model individual patient trajectories. Shifting to a biology-based rather than organ-based tumor definition enables personalized care that could advance RGT management and thus enhance patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Output Distributional Fairness via Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing techniques to achieve distributional parity are based on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, which is limited to single-output models. Extending previous works, our method employs an optimal transport mapping to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed for extending this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies, which compare our method to current existing post-processing baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Data-driven ODE modeling of the high-frequency complex dynamics of a fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [N. Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generating Physical Dynamics under Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the phenomenon of benign overfitting in binary classification problems with heavy-tailed input distributions. We extend the analysis of maximum margin classifiers to $\alpha$ sub-exponential distributions, where $\alpha \in (0,2]$, generalizing previous work that focused on sub-gaussian inputs. Our main result provides generalization error bounds for linear classifiers trained using gradient descent on unregularized logistic loss in this heavy-tailed setting. We prove that under certain conditions on the dimensionality $p$ and feature vector magnitude $\|\mu\|$, the misclassification error of the maximum margin classifier asymptotically approaches the noise level. This work contributes to the understanding of benign overfitting in more robust distribution settings and demonstrates that the phenomenon persists even with heavier-tailed inputs than previously studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce directional regularity, a new definition of anisotropy for multivariate functional data. Instead of taking the conventional view which determines anisotropy as a notion of smoothness along a dimension, directional regularity additionally views anisotropy through the lens of directions. We show that faster rates of convergence can be obtained through a change-of-basis by adapting to the directional regularity of a multivariate process. An algorithm for the estimation and identification of the change-of-basis matrix is constructed, made possible due to the unique replication structure of functional data. Non-asymptotic bounds are provided for our algorithm, supplemented by numerical evidence from an extensive simulation study. We discuss two possible applications of the directional regularity approach, and advocate its consideration as a standard pre-processing step in multivariate functional data analysis.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) improve their capabilities in handling complex tasks, the issues of computational cost and efficiency due to long prompts are becoming increasingly prominent. To accelerate model inference and reduce costs, we propose an innovative prompt compression framework called LanguaShrink. Inspired by the observation that LLM performance depends on the density and position of key information in the input prompts, LanguaShrink leverages psycholinguistic principles and the Ebbinghaus memory curve to achieve task-agnostic prompt compression. This effectively reduces prompt length while preserving essential information. We referred to the training method of OpenChat.The framework introduces part-of-speech priority compression and data distillation techniques, using smaller models to learn compression targets and employing a KL-regularized reinforcement learning strategy for training.\cite{wang2023openchat} Additionally, we adopt a chunk-based compression algorithm to achieve adjustable compression rates. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including LongBench, ZeroScrolls, Arxiv Articles, and a newly constructed novel test set. Experimental results show that LanguaShrink maintains semantic similarity while achieving up to 26 times compression. Compared to existing prompt compression methods, LanguaShrink improves end-to-end latency by 1.43 times.</description>

      <title>Improving Adaptivity via Over-Parameterization in Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that eigenfunctions of a kernel play a crucial role in kernel regression. Through several examples, we demonstrate that even with the same set of eigenfunctions, the order of these functions significantly impacts regression outcomes. Simplifying the model by diagonalizing the kernel, we introduce an over-parameterized gradient descent in the realm of sequence model to capture the effects of various orders of a fixed set of eigen-functions. This method is designed to explore the impact of varying eigenfunction orders. Our theoretical results show that the over-parameterization gradient flow can adapt to the underlying structure of the signal and significantly outperform the vanilla gradient flow method. Moreover, we also demonstrate that deeper over-parameterization can further enhance the generalization capability of the model. These results not only provide a new perspective on the benefits of over-parameterization and but also offer insights into the adaptivity and generalization potential of neural networks beyond the kernel regime.</description>

      <title>On the Pinsker bound of inner product kernel regression in large dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on recent studies of large-dimensional kernel regression, particularly those involving inner product kernels on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we investigate the Pinsker bound for inner product kernel regression in such settings. Specifically, we address the scenario where the sample size $n$ is given by $\alpha d^{\gamma}(1+o_{d}(1))$ for some $\alpha, \gamma&gt;0$. We have determined the exact minimax risk for kernel regression in this setting, not only identifying the minimax rate but also the exact constant, known as the Pinsker constant, associated with the excess risk.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis for Randomized Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically established algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO), where we assume the objective function $f$ follows GP. One notable drawback of GP-UCB is that the theoretical confidence parameter $\beta$ increased along with the iterations is too large. To alleviate this drawback, this paper analyzes the randomized variant of GP-UCB called improved randomized GP-UCB (IRGP-UCB), which uses the confidence parameter generated from the shifted exponential distribution. We analyze the expected regret and conditional expected regret, where the expectation and the probability are taken respectively with $f$ and noises and with the randomness of the BO algorithm. In both regret analyses, IRGP-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret upper bound without increasing the confidence parameter if the input domain is finite. Finally, we show numerical experiments using synthetic and benchmark functions and real-world emulators.</description>

      <title>Statistical Jump Model for Mixed-Type Data with Missing Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of clustering mixed-type data with temporal evolution by introducing the statistical jump model for mixed-type data. This novel framework incorporates regime persistence, enhancing interpretability and reducing the frequency of state switches, and efficiently handles missing data. The model is easily interpretable through its state-conditional means and modes, making it accessible to practitioners and policymakers. We validate our approach through extensive simulation studies and an empirical application to air quality data, demonstrating its superiority in inferring persistent air quality regimes compared to the traditional air quality index. Our contributions include a robust method for mixed-type temporal clustering, effective missing data management, and practical insights for environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning meets Panel Data -- Promises, Pitfalls, and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effect using machine learning (ML) algorithms can help to relax functional form assumptions if used within appropriate frameworks. However, most of these frameworks assume settings with cross-sectional data, whereas researchers often have access to panel data, which in traditional methods helps to deal with unobserved heterogeneity between units. In this paper, we explore how we can adapt double/debiased machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) for panel data in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. This adaptation is challenging because DML's cross-fitting procedure assumes independent data and the unobserved heterogeneity is not necessarily additively separable in settings with nonlinear observed confounding. We assess the performance of several intuitively appealing estimators in a variety of simulations. While we find violations of the cross-fitting assumptions to be largely inconsequential for the accuracy of the effect estimates, many of the considered methods fail to adequately account for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. However, we find that using predictive models based on the correlated random effects approach (Mundlak, 1978) within DML leads to accurate coefficient estimates across settings, given a sample size that is large relative to the number of observed confounders. We also show that the influence of the unobserved heterogeneity on the observed confounders plays a significant role for the performance of most alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Extracting Signal out of Chaos: Advancements on MAGI for Bayesian Analysis of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds off the manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) method for Bayesian parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction of ODE-based dynamical systems, focusing primarily on sparse and noisy data conditions. First, we introduce Pilot MAGI (pMAGI), a novel methodological upgrade on the base MAGI method that confers significantly-improved numerical stability, parameter inference, and trajectory reconstruction. Second, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, how one can combine MAGI-based methods with dynamical systems theory to provide probabilistic classifications of whether a system is stable or chaotic. Third, we demonstrate how pMAGI performs favorably in many settings against much more computationally-expensive and overparameterized methods. Fourth, we introduce Pilot MAGI Sequential Prediction (PMSP), a novel method building upon pMAGI that allows one to predict the trajectory of ODE-based dynamical systems multiple time steps into the future, given only sparse and noisy observations. We show that PMSP can output accurate future predictions even on chaotic dynamical systems and significantly outperform PINN-based methods. Overall, we contribute to the literature two novel methods, pMAGI and PMSP, that serve as Bayesian, uncertainty-quantified competitors to the Physics-Informed Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.</description>

      <title>Self-Directed Learning of Convex Labelings on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning the clusters of a given graph in the self-directed learning setup. This learning setting is a variant of online learning, where rather than an adversary determining the sequence in which nodes are presented, the learner autonomously and adaptively selects them. While self-directed learning of Euclidean halfspaces, linear functions, and general abstract multi-class hypothesis classes was recently considered, no results previously existed specifically for self-directed node classification on graphs. In this paper, we address this problem developing efficient algorithms for it. More specifically, we focus on the case of (geodesically) convex clusters, i.e., for every two nodes sharing the same label, all nodes on every shortest path between them also share the same label. In particular, we devise a polynomial-time algorithm that makes only $3(h(G)+1)^4 \ln n$ mistakes on graphs with two convex clusters, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and $h(G)$ is the Hadwiger number, i.e., the size of the largest clique minor of the graph $G$. We also show that our algorithm is robust to the case that clusters are slightly non-convex, still achieving a mistake bound logarithmic in $n$. Finally, for the more standard case of homophilic clusters, where strongly connected nodes tend to belong the same class, we devise a simple and efficient algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR), which seeks a lower-dimensional subspace of the predictors containing regression or classification information has been popular in a machine learning community. In this work, we present a new R software package psvmSDR that implements a new class of SDR estimators, which we call the principal machine (PM) generalized from the principal support vector machine (PSVM). The package covers both linear and nonlinear SDR and provides a function applicable to realtime update scenarios. The package implements the descent algorithm for the PMs to efficiently compute the SDR estimators in various situations. This easy-to-use package will be an attractive alternative to the dr R package that implements classical SDR methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel tempering is meta-algorithm for Markov Chain Monte Carlo that uses multiple chains to sample from tempered versions of the target distribution, enhancing mixing in multi-modal distributions that are challenging for traditional methods. The effectiveness of parallel tempering is heavily influenced by the selection of chain temperatures. Here, we present an adaptive temperature selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts temperatures during sampling using a policy gradient approach. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve lower integrated autocorrelation times compared to traditional geometrically spaced temperatures and uniform acceptance rate schemes on benchmark distributions.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refined differentially private (DP) data structure for kernel density estimation (KDE), offering not only improved privacy-utility tradeoff but also better efficiency over prior results. Specifically, we study the mathematical problem: given a similarity function $f$ (or DP KDE) and a private dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, our goal is to preprocess $X$ so that for any query $y\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we approximate $\sum_{x \in X} f(x, y)$ in a differentially private fashion. The best previous algorithm for $f(x,y) =\| x - y \|_1$ is the node-contaminated balanced binary tree by [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. Their algorithm requires $O(nd)$ space and time for preprocessing with $n=|X|$. For any query point, the query time is $d \log n$, with an error guarantee of $(1+\alpha)$-approximation and $\epsilon^{-1} \alpha^{-0.5} d^{1.5} R \log^{1.5} n$.
  In this paper, we improve the best previous result [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024] in three aspects:
  - We reduce query time by a factor of $\alpha^{-1} \log n$.
  - We improve the approximation ratio from $\alpha$ to 1.
  - We reduce the error dependence by a factor of $\alpha^{-0.5}$.
  From a technical perspective, our method of constructing the search tree differs from previous work [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. In prior work, for each query, the answer is split into $\alpha^{-1} \log n$ numbers, each derived from the summation of $\log n$ values in interval tree countings. In contrast, we construct the tree differently, splitting the answer into $\log n$ numbers, where each is a smart combination of two distance values, two counting values, and $y$ itself. We believe our tree structure may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Estimating Joint interventional distributions from marginal interventional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to exploit interventional data to acquire the joint conditional distribution of all the variables using the Maximum Entropy principle. To this end, we extend the Causal Maximum Entropy method to make use of interventional data in addition to observational data. Using Lagrange duality, we prove that the solution to the Causal Maximum Entropy problem with interventional constraints lies in the exponential family, as in the Maximum Entropy solution. Our method allows us to perform two tasks of interest when marginal interventional distributions are provided for any subset of the variables. First, we show how to perform causal feature selection from a mixture of observational and single-variable interventional data, and, second, how to infer joint interventional distributions. For the former task, we show on synthetically generated data, that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method on merging datasets, and yields comparable results to the KCI-test which requires access to joint observations of all variables.</description>

      <title>Bayesian CART models for aggregate claim modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes three types of Bayesian CART (or BCART) models for aggregate claim amount, namely, frequency-severity models, sequential models and joint models. We propose a general framework for the BCART models applicable to data with multivariate responses, which is particularly useful for the joint BCART models with a bivariate response: the number of claims and aggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we investigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity data by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution is superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture different tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that sequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence between the number of claims and average severity, are beneficial and thus preferable to the frequency-severity BCART models in which independence is assumed. The effectiveness of these models' performance is illustrated by carefully designed simulations and real insurance data.</description>

      <title>Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors in active inference agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG.

      <title>On the role of surrogates in the efficient estimation of treatment effects with limited outcome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.12408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many experimental and observational studies, the outcome of interest is often difficult or expensive to observe, reducing effective sample sizes for estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) even when identifiable. We study how incorporating data on units for which only surrogate outcomes not of primary interest are observed can increase the precision of ATE estimation. We refrain from imposing stringent surrogacy conditions, which permit surrogates as perfect replacements for the target outcome. Instead, we supplement the available, albeit limited, observations of the target outcome with abundant observations of surrogate outcomes, without any assumptions beyond unconfounded treatment assignment and missingness and corresponding overlap conditions. To quantify the potential gains, we derive the difference in efficiency bounds on ATE estimation with and without surrogates, both when an overwhelming or comparable number of units have missing outcomes. We develop robust ATE estimation and inference methods that realize these efficiency gains. We empirically demonstrate the gains by studying long-term-earning effects of job training.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Split Balancing for Optimal Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new random forest algorithm that constructs the trees using a novel adaptive split-balancing method. Rather than relying on the widely-used random feature selection, we propose a permutation-based balanced splitting criterion. The adaptive split balancing forest (ASBF), achieves minimax optimality under the Lipschitz class. Its localized version, which fits local regressions at the leaf level, attains the minimax rate under the broad H\"older class $\mathcal{H}^{q,\beta}$ of problems for any $q\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\beta\in(0,1]$. We identify that over-reliance on auxiliary randomness in tree construction may compromise the approximation power of trees, leading to suboptimal results. Conversely, the proposed less random, permutation-based approach demonstrates optimality over a wide range of models. Although random forests are known to perform well empirically, their theoretical convergence rates are slow. Simplified versions that construct trees without data dependence offer faster rates but lack adaptability during tree growth. Our proposed method achieves optimality in simple, smooth scenarios while adaptively learning the tree structure from the data. Additionally, we establish uniform upper bounds and demonstrate that ASBF improves dimensionality dependence in average treatment effect estimation problems. Simulation studies and real-world applications demonstrate our methods' superior performance over existing random forests.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Optimal Dynamic Treatment Assignment Rules under Policy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many policies involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where individuals receive sequential interventions over multiple stages. We study estimation of an optimal dynamic treatment regime that guides the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on their history. We propose an empirical welfare maximization approach in this dynamic framework, which estimates the optimal dynamic treatment regime using data from an experimental or quasi-experimental study while satisfying exogenous constraints on policies. The paper proposes two estimation methods: one solves the treatment assignment problem sequentially through backward induction, and the other solves the entire problem simultaneously across all stages. We establish finite-sample upper bounds on worst-case average welfare regrets for these methods and show their optimal $n^{-1/2}$ convergence rates. We also modify the simultaneous estimation method to accommodate intertemporal budget/capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Long-term Causal Inference Under Persistent Confounding via Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07234v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identification and estimation of long-term treatment effects when both experimental and observational data are available. Since the long-term outcome is observed only after a long delay, it is not measured in the experimental data, but only recorded in the observational data. However, both types of data include observations of some short-term outcomes. In this paper, we uniquely tackle the challenge of persistent unmeasured confounders, i.e., some unmeasured confounders that can simultaneously affect the treatment, short-term outcomes and the long-term outcome, noting that they invalidate identification strategies in previous literature. To address this challenge, we exploit the sequential structure of multiple short-term outcomes, and develop three novel identification strategies for the average long-term treatment effect. We further propose three corresponding estimators and prove their asymptotic consistency and asymptotic normality. We finally apply our methods to estimate the effect of a job training program on long-term employment using semi-synthetic data. We numerically show that our proposals outperform existing methods that fail to handle persistent confounders.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual extrapolation methods for monotone inclusions under local Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of monotone inclusion (MI) problems of finding a zero of the sum of two monotone operators, in which one operator is maximal monotone while the other is {\it locally Lipschitz} continuous. We propose primal-dual extrapolation methods to solve them using a point and operator extrapolation technique, whose parameters are chosen by a backtracking line search scheme. The proposed methods enjoy an operation complexity of ${\cal O}(\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$, measured by the number of fundamental operations consisting only of evaluations of one operator and resolvent of the other operator, for finding an $\varepsilon$-residual solution of strongly and non-strongly MI problems, respectively. The latter complexity significantly improves the previously best operation complexity ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. As a byproduct, complexity results of the primal-dual extrapolation methods are also obtained for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT or $\varepsilon$-residual solution of convex conic optimization, conic constrained saddle point, and variational inequality problems under {\it local Lipschitz} continuity. We provide preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>DiffLoad: Uncertainty Quantification in Electrical Load Forecasting with the Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting. The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads.

      <title>On the Benefits of Public Representations for Private Transfer Learning under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public pretraining is a promising approach to improve differentially private model training. However, recent work has noted that many positive research results studying this paradigm only consider in-distribution tasks, and may not apply to settings where there is distribution shift between the pretraining and finetuning data -- a scenario that is likely when finetuning private tasks due to the sensitive nature of the data. In this work, we show empirically across three tasks that even in settings with large distribution shift, where both zero-shot performance from public data and training from scratch with private data give unusably weak results, public features can in fact improve private training accuracy by up to 67\% over private training from scratch. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, showing that if the public and private data share a low-dimensional representation, public representations can improve the sample complexity of private training even if it is impossible to learn the private task from the public data alone. Altogether, our results provide evidence that public data can indeed make private training practical in realistic settings of extreme distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Automated Alignment of LLMs: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</description>

      <title>Directly Handling Missing Data in Linear Discriminant Analysis for Enhancing Classification Accuracy and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models expands into critical real-world applications, ensuring the explainability of these models becomes paramount, particularly in sensitive fields such as medicine and finance. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) remains a popular choice for classification due to its interpretable nature, derived from its capacity to model class distributions and enhance class separation through linear combinations of features. However, real-world datasets often suffer from incomplete data, posing substantial challenges for both classification accuracy and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust classification method, termed Weighted missing Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA), which extends LDA to handle datasets with missing values without the need for imputation. Our approach innovatively incorporates a weight matrix that penalizes missing entries, thereby refining parameter estimation directly on incomplete data. This methodology not only preserves the interpretability of LDA but also significantly enhances classification performance in scenarios plagued by missing data. We conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis to establish the properties of WLDA and thoroughly evaluate its explainability. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that WLDA consistently outperforms traditional methods, especially in challenging environments where missing values are prevalent in both training and test datasets. This advancement provides a critical tool for improving classification accuracy and maintaining model transparency in the face of incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust risk evaluation with an isotonic constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning under distribution shift is challenging when neither prior knowledge nor fully accessible data from the target distribution is available. Distributionally robust learning (DRL) aims to control the worst-case statistical performance within an uncertainty set of candidate distributions, but how to properly specify the set remains challenging. To enable distributional robustness without being overly conservative, in this paper, we propose a shape-constrained approach to DRL, which incorporates prior information about the way in which the unknown target distribution differs from its estimate. More specifically, we assume the unknown density ratio between the target distribution and its estimate is isotonic with respect to some partial order. At the population level, we provide a solution to the shape-constrained optimization problem that does not involve the isotonic constraint. At the sample level, we provide consistency results for an empirical estimator of the target in a range of different settings. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the improved accuracy of the proposed shape-constrained approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting, in which only samples from the environment are available. We give a theoretical analysis of the convergence of PID TD Learning and its acceleration compared to the conventional TD Learning. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of learning uncertainty-aware representations for graph-structured data. While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODE) are effective in learning node representations, they fail to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through Brownian motion to quantify uncertainty. We provide theoretical guarantees for LGNSDE and empirically show better performance in uncertainty quantification.</description>
