      <title>Climatic Effects of Ocean Salinity on M Dwarf Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean salinity is known to dramatically affect the climates of Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars, with high salinity leading to less ice and higher surface temperature. However, how ocean composition impacts climate under different conditions, such as around different types of stars or at different positions within the habitable zone, has not been investigated. We used ROCKE-3D, an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, to simulate how planetary climate responds to ocean salinities for planets with G-star vs. M-dwarf hosts at several stellar fluxes. We find that increasing ocean salinity from 20 to 100 g/kg in our model results in non-linear ice reduction and warming on G-star planets, sometimes causing abrupt transitions to different climate states. Conversely, sea ice on M-dwarf planets responds more gradually and linearly to increasing salinity. Moreover, reductions in sea ice on M-dwarf planets are not accompanied by significant surface warming as on G-star planets. High salinity can modestly bolster the resilience of M-dwarf planets against snowball glaciation and allow these planets to retain surface liquid water further from their host star, but the effects are muted compared to G-star planets that experience snowball bifurcation and climate hysteresis due to the ice-albedo feedback.</description>

      <title>Jovian Vortex Hunter: a citizen science project to study Jupiter's vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jovian atmosphere contains a wide diversity of vortices, which have a large range of sizes, colors and forms in different dynamical regimes. The formation processes for these vortices is poorly understood, and aside from a few known, long-lived ovals, such as the Great Red Spot, and Oval BA, vortex stability and their temporal evolution are currently largely unknown. In this study, we use JunoCam data and a citizen-science project on Zooniverse to derive a catalog of vortices, some with repeated observations, through May 2018 to Sep 2021, and analyze their associated properties, such as size, location and color. We find that different colored vortices (binned as white, red, brown and dark), follow vastly different distributions in terms of their sizes and where they are found on the planet. We employ a simplified stability criterion using these vortices as a proxy, to derive a minimum Rossby deformation length for the planet of $\sim1800$ km. We find that this value of $L_d$ is largely constant throughout the atmosphere, and does not have an appreciable meridional gradient.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Fate of Exoplanet Systems: Asteroseismic Identification of Host Star in the Red Clump or Red Giant Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the evolutionary stage of stars is crucial for understanding the evolution of exoplanetary systems. In this context, Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Red Clump (RC) stars, stages in the later evolution of stars situated before and after the helium flash, harbor critical clues to unveiling the evolution of planets. The first step in revealing these clues is to confirm the evolutionary stage of the host stars through asteroseismology. However, up to now, host stars confirmed to be RGB or RC stars are extremely rare. In this investigation, we present a comprehensive asteroseismic analysis of two evolved stars, HD 120084 and HD 29399, known to harbor exoplanets, using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We have discovered for the first time that HD 120084 is a Red Clump star in the helium-core burning phase, and confirmed that HD 29399 is a Red Giant Branch star in the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Through the precise measurement of asteroseismic parameters such as $\nu_{max}$, $\Delta\nu$ and $\Delta\Pi_{1}$ we have determined the evolutionary states of these stars and derived their fundamental stellar parameters.
  The significance of this study lies in the application of automated techniques to measure asymptotic period spacings in red giants, which provides critical insights into the evolutionary outcomes of exoplanet systems. We demonstrate that asteroseismology is a potent tool for probing the internal structures of stars, thereby offering a window into the past and future dynamics of planetary orbits. The presence of a long-period giant planet orbiting HD 120084, in particular, raises intriguing questions about the potential engulfment of inner planets during the host star's expansion, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of the the near-solar bound dust grains detected with Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) counts dust impacts in the near-solar region, but modelling effort is needed to understand the dust population's properties. We aim to constrain the dust cloud's properties based on the flux observed by PSP. We develop a forward-model for the bound dust detection rates using the formalism of 6D phase space distribution of the dust. We apply the model to the location table of different PSP's solar encounter groups. We explain some of the near-perihelion features observed in the data as well as the broader characteristic of the dust flux between 0.15 AU and 0.5 AU. We compare the measurements of PSP to the measurements of Solar Orbiter (SolO) near 1 AU to expose the differences between the two spacecraft. We found that the dust flux observed by PSP between 0.15 AU and 0.5 AU in post-perihelia can be explained by dust on bound orbits and is consistent with a broad range of orbital parameters, including dust on circular orbits. However, the dust number density as a function of the heliocentric distance and the scaling of detection efficiency with the relative speed are important to explain the observed flux variation. The data suggest that the slope of differential mass distribution ${\delta}$ is between 0.14 and 0.49. The near-perihelion observations, however, show the flux maxima, which are inconsistent with the circular dust model, and additional effects may play a role. We found indication that the sunward side of PSP is less sensitive to the dust impacts, compared to the other PSP's surfaces. Conclusions. We show that the dust flux on PSP can be explained by non-circular bound dust and the detection capabilities of PSP. The scaling of flux with the impact speed is especially important, and shallower than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI): A Lunar Long-Baseline UV/Optical Imaging Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's return to the Moon presents unparalleled opportunities to advance high-impact scientific capabilities. At the cutting edge of these possibilities are extremely high-resolution interferometric observations at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. Such technology can resolve the surfaces of stars, explore the inner accretion disks of nascent stars and black holes, and eventually enable us to observe surface features and weather patterns on nearby exoplanets. We have been awarded Phase 1 support from NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program to explore the feasibility of constructing a high-resolution, long-baseline UV/optical imaging interferometer on the lunar surface, in conjunction with the Artemis Program. A 1996 study comparing interferometers on the Moon versus free-flyers in space concluded that, without pre-existing lunar infrastructure, free-flyers were preferable. However, with the advent of the Artemis Program, it is now crucial to revisit the potential of building lunar interferometers. Our objective is to conduct a study with the same level of rigor applied to large baseline, free-flying interferometers during the 2003-2005 NASA Vision Missions Studies. This preparation is essential for timely and effective utilization of the forthcoming lunar infrastructure. In this paper, we highlight the groundbreaking potential of a lunar surface-based interferometer. This concept study will be a huge step forward to larger arrays on both the moon and free-flying in space, over a wide variety of wavelengths and science topics. Our Phase 1 study began in April 2024, and here we present a concise overview of our vision and the progress made so far.</description>

      <title>Predicting RSO Populations Using a Neighbouring Orbits Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the full population of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is a key issue in the field of space situational awareness that will only increase in importance in the coming years. We endeavour to describe a novel method of inferring the population of RSOs as a function of orbital height and inclination for a range of magnitudes. The method described uses observations of an orbit of known height and inclination to detect RSOs on neighbouring orbits. These neighbouring orbit targets move slowly relative to our tracked orbit, and are thus detectable down to faint magnitudes. We conduct simulations to show that, by observing multiple passes of a known orbit, we can infer the population of RSOs within a defined region of orbital parameter space. Observing a range of orbits from different orbital sites will allow for the inference of a population of LEO RSOs as a function of their orbital parameters and object magnitude.</description>

      <title>Revisiting physical parameters of the benchmark brown dwarf LHS 6343 C through a HST/WFC3 secondary eclipse observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf, LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such brown dwarf eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate sub-stellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this brown dwarf's mass (62.6+/-2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788+/-0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia DR3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a NIR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5+/-1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong non-equilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modelled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependant analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C's apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modelled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system's distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/Lsun) = -4.77+/-0.03 and, applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303+/-29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of 2.86 +0.40-0.33 Gyr and 3.11 +0.50-0.38 Gyr respectively.</description>

      <title>Mapping "Brain Terrain" Regions on Mars using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing "Brain Coral" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are available on Github for the community to explore and build upon.</description>

      <title>Unveiling MOA-2007-BLG-192: An M Dwarf Hosting a Likely Super-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high angular resolution images of the microlensing target MOA-2007-BLG-192 using Keck adaptive optics and the Hubble Space Telescope. The planetary host star is robustly detected as it separates from the background source star in nearly all of the Keck and Hubble data. The amplitude and direction of the lens-source separation allows us to break a degeneracy related to the microlensing parallax and source radius crossing time. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of possible solutions by a factor of ${\sim}2$, demonstrating the power of high angular resolution follow-up imaging for events with sparse light curve coverage. Following Bennett et al. 2023, we apply constraints from the high resolution imaging on the light curve modeling to find host star and planet masses of $M_{\textrm{host}} = 0.28 \pm 0.04M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 12.49^{+65.47}_{-8.03}M_{\oplus}$ at a distance from Earth of $D_L = 2.16 \pm 0.30\,$kpc. This work illustrates the necessity for the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to use its own high resolution imaging to inform light curve modeling for microlensing planets that the mission discovers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BOREXINO experiment has been collecting solar neutrino data since 2007, providing the opportunity to study the variation of the event rate over a decade. We find that at 96 \% C.L., the rate of low energy events shows a time modulation favoring a correlation with a flux from Jupiter. We present a new physics model, the Jovian Whisper Model, based on dark matter of mass $\sim 0.1-4$ GeV captured by Jupiter that can account for such modulation. We discuss how the Jovian Whisper Model (JWM) can be tested.</description>
