      <title>Tachyons Before Tachyons: Lev Strum (1890-1936) and Superluminal Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No particle or signal carrying information can travel at a speed exceeding that of light in vacuum. Although this has for a long time been accepted as a law of nature, prior to Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity the possibility of superluminal motion of electrons was widely discussed by Arnold Sommerfeld and other physicists. Besides, it is not obvious that special relativity rules out such motion under all circumstances. From approximately 1965 to 1985 the hypothesis of tachyons moving faster than light was seriously entertained by a minority of physicists. This paper reviews the early history concerning superluminal signals and pays particular attention to the ideas proposed in the 1920s by the little known Ukrainian physicist Lev Strum (Shtrum). As he pointed out in a paper of 1923, within the framework of relativity it is possible for a signal to move superluminally without violating the law of causality. Part of this article is devoted to the personal and scientific biography of the undeservedly neglected Strum, whose career was heavily and eventually fatally influenced by the political situation in Stalin's Russia. Remarkably, to the limited extent that Strum is known today, it is as a literary figure in a novel and not as a real person.</description>

      <title>Chien-Shiung Wu as the experimental pioneer in quantum entanglement: a 2022 note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advised by Prof. Chen Ning Yang, we review the early pioneering work by Chien-Shiung Wu on entangled photons created from the electron-positron annihilation. This paper formed a basis of the author's speech at International Symposium Commemorating the 110th Birth Anniversary of Chien-Shiung Wu, May 31, 2022, and of a few articles on the subject in Chinese.</description>
