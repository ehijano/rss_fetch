      <title>Product of two involutions in quaternionic special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element of a group is called reversible if it is conjugate to its own inverse. Reversible elements are closely related to strongly reversible elements, which can be expressed as a product of two involutions. In this paper, we classify the reversible and strongly reversible elements in the quaternionic special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{H})$ and quaternionic projective linear group $ \mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{H})$. We prove that an element of $ \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{H})$ (resp. $ \mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{H})$) is reversible if and only if it is a product of two skew-involutions (resp. involutions).</description>

      <title>Unitary Representations of the Isometry Groups of Urysohn Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a complete classification of the continuous unitary representations of the isometry group of the rational Urysohn space $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}$. As a consequence, we show that Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$ has property (T). We also derive several ergodic theoretic consequences from this classification: $(i)$ every probability measure-preserving action of Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$ is either essentially free or essentially transitive, $(ii)$ every ergodic Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$-invariant probability measure on $[0,1]^{\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}}$ is a product measure. We obtain the same results for isometry groups of variations of $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}$, such as the rational Urysohn sphere $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}_1$, the integral Urysohn space $\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{U}$, etc.</description>

      <title>Transitivity in wreath products with symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20495v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the notion of a transitive subgroup of a permutation group $P$ extends naturally to the subsets of $P$. We study transitive subsets of the wreath product $G \wr S_n$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group. This includes the hyperoctahedral group for $G=C_2$. We give structural characterisations of transitive subsets using the character theory of $G \wr S_n$ and interpret such subsets as designs in the conjugacy class association scheme of $G \wr S_n$. In particular, we prove a generalisation of the Livingstone-Wagner theorem and give explicit constructions of transitive sets. Moreover, we establish connections to orthogonal polynomials, namely the Charlier polynomials, and use them to study codes and designs in $C_r \wr S_n$. Many of our results extend results about the symmetric group $S_n$.</description>

      <title>On inner-amenability and boundary actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete countable group. The first main result of this work is that if $\Gamma$ is ICC inner-amenable non-amenable then it cannot satisfy the (AO)-property, answering a question posed by C. Anantharaman-Delaroche. It is also proved that if $\Gamma$ is a "sufficiently large" discrete subgroup of a product of locally compact second countable bi-exact groups, then it cannot be inner-amenable. Both these results generalize the well-known fact that ICC non-amenable inner-amenable discrete countable groups cannot be bi-exact.</description>

      <title>On the irreducible character degrees of symmetric groups and their multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider problems concerning the largest degrees of irreducible characters of symmetric groups, and the multiplicities of character degrees of symmetric groups. Using evidence from computer experiments, we posit several new conjectures or extensions of previous conjectures, and prove a number of results. One of these is that, if $n\geq 21$, then there are at least eight irreducible characters of $S_n$, all of which have the same degree, and which have irreducible restriction to $A_n$. We explore similar questions about unipotent degrees of $\GL_n(q)$. We also make some remarks about how the experiments here shed light on posited algorithms for finding the largest irreducible character degree of $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two minimality properties of subgroups in topological groups. A subgroup $H$ is a key subgroup (co-key subgroup) of a topological group $G$ if there is no strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology on $G$ which induces on $H$ (resp., on the coset space $G/H$) the original topology. Every co-minimal subgroup is a key subgroup while the converse is not true. Every locally compact co-compact subgroup is a key subgroup (but not always co-minimal). Any relatively minimal subgroup is a co-key subgroup (but not vice versa). Extending some results concerning the generalized Heisenberg groups, we prove that the center ("corner" subgroup) of the upper unitriangular group $\mathrm{UT(n,K)}$, defined over a commutative topological unital ring $K$, is a key subgroup. Every "non-corner" 1-parameter subgroup $H$ of $\mathrm{UT(n,K)}$ is a co-key subgroup. We study injectivity property of the restriction map $$r_H \colon \mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(G) \to \mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(H), \ \sigma \mapsto \sigma|_H$$ and show that it is an isomorphism of sup-semilattices for every central co-minimal subgroup $H$, where $\mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(G)$ is the semilattice of coarser Hausdorff group topologies on $G$.</description>

      <title>Towards Information Theory-Based Discovery of Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries imposes a stringent set of constraints on a system. This constrained structure allows intelligent agents interacting with such a system to drastically improve the efficiency of learning and generalization, through the internalisation of the system's symmetries into their information-processing. In parallel, principled models of complexity-constrained learning and behaviour make increasing use of information-theoretic methods. Here, we wish to marry these two perspectives and understand whether and in which form the information-theoretic lens can "see" the effect of symmetries of a system. For this purpose, we propose a novel variant of the Information Bottleneck principle, which has served as a productive basis for many principled studies of learning and information-constrained adaptive behaviour. We show (in the discrete case and under a specific technical assumption) that our approach formalises a certain duality between symmetry and information parsimony: namely, channel equivariances can be characterised by the optimal mutual information-preserving joint compression of the channel's input and output. This information-theoretic treatment furthermore suggests a principled notion of "soft" equivariance, whose "coarseness" is measured by the amount of input-output mutual information preserved by the corresponding optimal compression. This new notion offers a bridge between the field of bounded rationality and the study of symmetries in neural representations. The framework may also allow (exact and soft) equivariances to be automatically discovered.</description>

      <title>The sphere complex of a locally finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally finite graph $\Gamma$, we consider its mapping class group $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ as defined by Algom-Kfir-Bestvina. For these groups, we prove a generalization of the results of Laudenbach and Brendle-Broaddus-Putman, producing a $3$-manifold $M_{\Gamma}$ whose mapping class group surjects onto $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ with kernel a compact abelian group of sphere twists so that the corresponding short exact sequence splits. Along the way we obtain an induced faithful action of $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ on the sphere complex $\mathcal{S}(M_{\Gamma})$ of $M_{\Gamma}$, which is the simplicial complex whose simplices are isotopy classes of finite collections of spheres in $M_{\Gamma}$ which are pairwise disjoint. When $\Gamma$ has finite rank, we further show that the action of $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ on a certain natural subcomplex has elements with positive translation length, and also consider a candidate for an Outer space of such a graph. As another application, we prove that for many $\Gamma$, $\text{Map}(\Gamma)$ is quasi-isometric to a particular subgraph of $\mathcal{S}(M_{\Gamma})$, following Schaffer-Cohen. We also deduce analogs of the results of Domat-Hoganson-Kwak.</description>
