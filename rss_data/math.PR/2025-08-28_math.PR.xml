      <title>Score-Based Diffusion Models in Infinite Dimensions: A Malliavin Calculus Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new mathematical framework for score-based diffusion modelling in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces, through Malliavin calculus, extending generative modelling techniques beyond the finite-dimensional setting. The forward diffusion process is formulated as a linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by space--time coloured noise with a trace-class covariance operator, ensuring well--posedness in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Building on Malliavin calculus and an infinite-dimensional extension of the Bismut--Elworthy--Li formula, we derive an exact, closed-form expression for the score function (the Fr\'echet derivative of the log-density) without relying on finite-dimensional projections or discretisation. Our operator--theoretic approach preserves the intrinsic geometry of Hilbert spaces and accommodates general trace-class operators, thereby incorporating spatially correlated noise without assuming semigroup invertibility. The framework also connects score estimation to functional data analysis, enabling computational strategies such as kernel methods and neural operator architectures.</description>

      <title>On a class of multiplicative Lindley-type recursions with Markov-modulated dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Markov-modulated dependencies for the multiplicative Lindley's recursion $W_{n+1}=[V_{n}W_{n}+Y_{n}(V_{n})]^{+}$, where $Y_{n}(V_{n})$ may depend on $V_{n}$, and can be written as the difference of two nonnegative random variables that also depend on a common background discrete-time Markov chain $\{Z_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. Given the state of the background Markov chain, we consider two cases: a) $V_{n}$ equals either 1, or $a\in(0,1)$, or it is negative with certain probabilities, and $Y_{n}(V_{n}):=Y_{n}=S_{n}-A_{n+1}$, where both $A_n$ and $S_n$ have a rational Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST). b) $V_{n}$ equals $1$ or $-1$ according to certain probabilities, and $Y_{n}(V_{n})$ follow a more general scheme, dependent on $V_{n}$. In both cases, we derive the LST of the stationary transform vector of $\{W_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. In the second case, we also provide a recursive approach to obtain the steady-state moments and investigate its asymptotic behavior. A simple numerical example illustrates the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-drawing P\'olya urns via labelled random DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A P\'olya urn of replacement matrix $R=(R_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq d}$ is a Markov process that encodes the following experiment: an urn contains balls of $d$ different colours and at every time-step, a ball is drawn uniformly at random in the urn, and if its colour is $i$, then it is replaced in the urn with an additional $R_{i,j}$ balls of colour $j$, for all $1\leq i, j\leq d$. We study a natural extension of this model in which, instead of drawing one ball at each time-step, we draw a set of $m\geq 2$ balls: in this case, the replacement matrix becomes a replacement tensor. Because of the multi-draws, this process can no longer be seen as a branching process, which makes its analysis much more intricate than in the classical P\'olya urn case. Partial results proved by stochastic approximation techniques exist in the literature. In this article, we introduce a new approach based on seeing the process as a stochastic process indexed by a random directed-acyclic graph (DAG) and use this approach, together with the theory of stochastic tensors, to prove a convergence theorem for these multi-drawing P\'olya urns, with assumptions that are straightforward to check in practice.</description>

      <title>Pricing American options time-capped by a drawdown even in a L\'evy market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a derivation of the explicit price for the perpetual American put option time-capped by the first drawdown epoch beyond a predefined level. We consider the market in which an asset price is described by geometric L\'evy process with downward exponential jumps. We show that the optimal stopping rule is the first time when the asset price gets below a special value. The proof relies on martingale arguments and the fluctuation theory of L\'evy processes. We also provide a numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Sampling properties of the zeroes of the Gaussian entire function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sampling properties of the zero set of the Gaussian entire function on Fock spaces. Firstly, we relax Seip and Wallst\'en's density and separation conditions for sampling sets on Fock spaces to obtain weighted inequalities for sets that are not necessarily sampling. On the probabilistic front, we estimate the number of zeroes of the Gaussian entire functions that are close to each other. We use these to prove random sampling inequalities for polynomials of degree at most $d$ using ${d}+o(d)$ points, and show that, with high probability, the sampling constants grow slower than $d^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In particular, we recover a result from Lyons and Zhai in the case of the Gaussian entire function, where it is shown that the zeroes are (almost surely) a uniqueness set for the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence for extremal spacings in Kakutani's random interval-splitting process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kakutani's random interval-splitting process iteratively divides, via a uniformly random splitting point, the largest sub-interval in a partition of the unit interval. The length of the longest sub-interval after $n$ steps, suitably centred and scaled, is known to satisfy a central limit theorem as $n \to \infty$. We provide a quantitative (Berry-Esseen) upper bound for the finite-$n$ approximation in the central limit theorem, with conjecturally optimal rates in $n$. We also prove convergence to an exponential distribution for the length of the smallest sub-interval, with quantitative bounds. The Kakutani process can be embedded in certain branching and fragmentation processes, and we translate our results into that context also. Our proof uses conditioning on an intermediate time, a conditional independence structure for statistics involving small sub-intervals, an Hermite-Edgeworth expansion, and moments estimates with quantitative error bounds.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by L\'evy processes with common noise on an infinite time horizon, by means of a contraction mapping principle in the space of probability measures. In addition, we analyse the propagation of chaos for L\'evy-driven McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the presence of common noise.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <title>Random attractors and nonergodic attractors for diffusions with degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion on a bounded domain, assuming that the system is irreducible inside the domain and that the diffusion has varying degree of degeneracy on the domain's boundary. The long-term statistical properties of typical trajectories started inside the domain may be governed by one invariant measure or more than one invariant measure. We describe various possible scenarios. In dimensions 1 and 2 under boundary hyperbolicity assumptions, we give a complete classification of the limiting behavior and answer the question whether sequential averaging involving more than one invariant distribution occurs. In all cases, we compute the set of weak limit points of empirical measures. Our hitting-time estimates used to prove transience or recurrence are based on a new version of the Foster-Lyapunov technique. Extensions to nonhyperbolic boundaries and higher dimensions are discussed and an application to growth rates in scalable networks is given.</description>

      <title>Modern aspects of Markov chains: entropy, curvature and the cutoff phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomenon is an abrupt transition from out of equilibrium to equilibrium undergone by certain Markov processes in the limit where the size of the state space tends to infinity: instead of decaying gradually over time, their distance to equilibrium remains close to its maximal value for a while and suddenly drops to zero as the time parameter reaches a critical threshold. Discovered four decades ago in the context of card shuffling, this surprising phenomenon has since then been observed in a variety of models, from random walks on groups or complex networks to interacting particle systems. It is now believed to be universal among fast-mixing high-dimensional processes. Yet, current proofs are heavily model-dependent, and identifying the general conditions that trigger a cutoff remains one of the biggest challenges in the quantitative analysis of finite Markov chains. The purpose of these lecture notes is to provide a self-contained introduction to this fascinating question, and to describe its recently-uncovered relations with entropy, curvature and concentration.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay, we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern inference architectures.</description>

      <title>Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</description>

      <title>Formal equivalence between global optimization consistency and random search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a proof that any stochastic and iterative global optimization algorithm is consistent over Lipschitz continuous functions if and only if it samples the whole search space. To achieve this, we use the L$\exists$$\forall$N theorem prover and the Mathlib library. The major challenge of this formalization, apart from the technical aspects of the proof itself, is to converge to a definition of a stochastic and iterative global optimization algorithm that is both general enough to encompass all algorithms of this type and specific enough to be used in a formal proof. We define such an algorithm as a pair of an initial probability measure and a sequence of Markov kernels that describe the distribution of the next point sampled by the algorithm given the previous points and their evaluations. We then construct a probability measure on finite and infinite sequences of iterations of the algorithm using the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem.</description>

      <title>Sharp Online Hardness for Large Balanced Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is $\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality. While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <title>An approximate zero-one law via the Dialectica interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-one laws state that probabilistic events of a certain type must occur with probability either $0$ or $1$, and nothing in between. We formulate a syntactic zero-one law, which enjoys good logical properties while being broadly applicable in probability theory. Then, inspired by G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, we finitise it: The result is an approximate zero-one law which states that events with a particular finite structure occur with probability close to $0$ or $1$ up to an arbitrary degree of precision. This approximate zero-one law is equivalent - over classical logic - to the original zero-one law, but in contrast to the latter, is formulated entirely in terms of finite unions and intersections of events. Furthermore, in line with recent logical metatheorems for probability, it admits a computational interpretation, which in turn facilitates a quantitative analysis of theorems whose proof makes use of zero-one laws. Concrete applications in this spirit, over a variety of different settings, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palm distributions play a central role in the study of point processes and their associated summary statistics. In this paper, we characterize the Palm distributions of the superposition of two independent point processes, establishing a simple mixture representation depending on the point processes' Palm distributions and moment measures. We explore two statistical applications enabled by our main result. First, we consider minimum contrast estimation for superposed point processes based on Ripley's $K$ function. Second, we focus on the class of shot-noise Cox processes and obtain a tractable expression for the Janossy density which leads to maximum likelihood estimation via a novel expectation-maximization algorithm. Both approaches are validated through numerical simulations. Extensions to the superposition of multiple point processes, and higher-order Palm distributions, are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.10235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov chain with rather general state space which has an invariant probability measure $\mu$. There are several sufficient conditions in the literature which guarantee convergence of all or $\mu$-almost all transition probabilities to $\mu$ in the total variation (TV) metric: irreducibility plus aperiodicity, equivalence properties of transition probabilities, or coupling properties. In this work, we review and improve some of these criteria in such a way that they become necessary and sufficient for TV convergence of all respectively $\mu$-almost all transition probabilities. In addition, we discuss so-called generalized couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of discrete rectangular uniform distributions on the natural numbers-referred to as orthogonal dice-characterized by the property that their means equal their variances. These distributions arise naturally in statistics and applied mathematics. We show that the orthogonal dice correspond to solutions of a quadratic Diophantine equation on the naturals, exhibiting divisibility properties tied to their dimensions, generating coprime arithmetic progressions, yielding disjoint partitions of the naturals, and displaying self-similarity. Their associated random counting measures (mixed binomial processes) exhibit interesting structural properties, including orthogonal splitting and convergence to Poisson limits. As a result, the orthogonal dice define canonical stochastic processes that that may be used to construct Brownian and geometric Brownian motions. More broadly, they serve as Poisson-like building blocks-natural substrates for modeling systems with bounded counts. Furthermore, they induce a trichotomy within the broader class of such distributions, partitioning them into three infinite subfamilies-negative, orthogonal, and positive-according to their mean-variance relationships.</description>

Abstract: The hierarchical Dirichlet process is a discrete random measure used as a prior in Bayesian nonparametrics and motivated by the study of groups of clustered data. We study the asymptotic behavior of the power sum symmetric polynomials for the vector of weights of the hierarchical Dirichlet process as the concentration parameters tend to infinity. We establish central limit theorems and obtain explicit representations for the asymptotic variances, with the latter clearly showing the impact of the hierarchical structure. These objects are related to the homozygosity in population genetics, the Simpson diversity index in ecology, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index in economics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

Abstract: We consider entropy-optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first extend the approximate factorization for purely discontinuous Markov process established in \cite{CKSV20} by getting rid of some of the conditions imposed in \cite{CKSV20}. Then we apply the approximate factorization to obtain sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for three classes of processes: stable-like processes with critical killings in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets; killed stable-like processes in the setting of \cite{KW24} in $C^{1, \varepsilon}$ open sets; and non-symmetric stable processes in what we call $C^{1,2{\text - \rm Dini}}$ open sets. In particular, we obtain explicit sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates of killed $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and of censored $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (1, 2)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general class of $n\times n$ random band matrices with bandwidth $W$. When $W^2\ll n$, we prove that with high probability the eigenvectors of such matrices are localized and decay exponentially at the sharp scale $W^2$. Combined with the delocalization results of Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718] and of Erd\H{o}s and Riabov [arXiv:2506.06441], this establishes the conjectured localization-delocalization transition for a large class of random band matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trawl processes is a family of continuous-time, infinitely divisible, stationary processes whose correlation structure is entirely characterized by its so-called trawl function. This paper investigates the problem of estimating non-linear functionals of a trawl function under an in-fill and a long-span sampling scheme. Specifically, building on the work of \cite{SauriVeraart23}, we introduce non-parametric estimators for functionals of the type $\Psi_{t}(g)=\int_{0}^{t}g(a(s))\mathrm{d}s$ and $ \Lambda_t(g)=\int_{t}^{\infty}g(a(s))\mathrm{d}s$ where $a$ represents the trawl function of interest and $g$ a non-linear test function. We show that our estimator for $\Psi_{t}(g)$ is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian regardless of the memory of the process. We further demonstrates that the same phenomenon occurs for the estimation of $\Lambda_t(g)$ as long as $g(x)= \mathrm{O} (\lvert x\rvert^p)$, as $x\to0$, for some $p&gt;3$. Additionally, we illustrate how our results can be used to test the presence of $T$-dependent data that is robust to persistence.</description>

      <title>Estimating the errors for solutions of the SAA method to solve compound and risk averse stochastic programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a study on solutions of the Sample Average Approximation Method to solve compound stochastic programs. We derive nonasymptotic upper estimates for probabilities of the approximation errors. The results depend on the sample size with explicit terms instead of unspecified universal constants. They allow to conclude immediately nonasymptotic rates for the optimal solutions, and they may be utilized to construct nonasymptotic confidence regions for unique solutions of the genuine compound stochastic programs. In the special case of classical risk neutral stochastic programs, we end up with upper estimates of deviation probabilities for M-estimators, and their nonasymptotic rates. Moreover, we may also demonstrate how to apply the results to sample average approximation of risk averse stochastic programs. In this respect we consider stochastic programs expressed in terms of absolute semideviation risk measures and Average Value at Risk. The investigations are based on concentration inequalities from the recent contribution Kr\"atschmer (2024a). The line of reasoning does not rely on pathwise analytical properties of the objectives. In particular, continuity or convexity in the parameter is not imposed in advance as usual in the literature on the Sample Average Approximation method. It is also shown that objectives with H\"older continuous paths meet the requirements of the main results. Moreover, the main results are applied to objectives whose paths are piecewise H\"older continuous, as e.g. in two stage mixed-integer programs.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider a suitable generalization of the Feynman path integral on a specific class of Riemannian manifolds consisting of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant Riemannian metrics. The main tools we use are the Cartan development map, the notion of oscillatory integral, and the Chernoff approximation theorem. We prove that, for a class of functions of a dense subspace of the relevant Hilbert space, the Feynman map produces the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, where the Laplace-Beltrami operator coincides with the second order Casimir operator of the group.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require adaptive step sizes to have a "no skip" property and to take values at only dyadic times. Secondly, in contrast to the Euler-Maruyama method, we require the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured Riemann surface with Euler characteristic $\chi(S)&lt;0$. For any unitary representation $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, we introduce its renormalized energy and its harmonic representatives, which are equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Our main result is that if a sequence of unitary representations $\rho_j$ strongly converges, then their renormalized energies converge to $\frac{\pi}{4}|\chi(S)|$ and the shape of their harmonic representatives converges to a unique rescaled hyperbolic metric. Combining this statement with examples of strongly converging representations provided by random matrix theory, we derive the following applications.
  (1) If $\pi_1(S)$ is a free group, then for a random $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, the shape of its harmonic representatives concentrates around a rescaled hyperbolic metric with high probability as $N\to \infty$.
  (2) For any closed hyperbolic surface, a finite covering admits a harmonic immersion into some Euclidean unit sphere, which is almost isometric after rescaling.
  (3) There are closed, branched, minimal surfaces $\mathfrak{S}_j$ in some Euclidean unit spheres such that $\mathfrak{S}_j$ Benjamini-Schramm converges to a rescaled hyperbolic plane as $j\to \infty$, and the Gaussian curvature $K_j$ of $\mathfrak{S}_j$ satisfies $\lim_{j\to \infty} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Area}(\mathfrak{S}_j)}\int_{\mathfrak{S}_j} |K_j+8|=0.$</description>

      <title>Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model including telomerase activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer. In this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of the process. We study theoretical properties of this model, including its long-term behaviour. In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model parameters on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the population of cells.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable evolutionary and mean field games and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A replicator dynamic for non-exchangeable agents in a continuous action space is formulated and its well-posedness is proven in a space of probability measures. The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>

      <title>A tail bound for cumulant series for complex functions of independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit bounds on the truncation error of the cumulant series of a bounded complex function of a random vector with independent components. The bounds are based on multidimensional differences. This extends the theory of the author with Brendan McKay and Rui-Ray Zhang (J. Combin. Th., Ser. B, 2025) from real functions to complex functions. We demonstrate some initial applications including a Berry--Esseen bound, an Edgeworth expansion for triangles in random graphs, and enumeration of regular graphs.</description>
