      <title>Optimal Kinematics for Energy Harvesting Using Favorable Wake-Foil Interactions in Tandem Oscillating Hydrofoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy harvesting performance of a pair of oscillating hydrofoil turbines in tandem configuration is experimentally studied to determine the optimal kinematics of the array. By characterizing interactions between the wake produced by the leading foil and the trailing foil, the kinematic configuration required to maximize array power extraction is determined. This is done by prescribing leading foil kinematics that produce specific wake regimes, identified by the maximum effective angle of attack parameter. The kinematics of the trailing foil are allowed to vary significantly from those of the leading foil. The heave and pitch amplitude, inter-foil phase, and foil separation of the trailing foil are varied within each wake regime and the system performance is evaluated. The power extracted by each foil over an oscillation cycle is measured through force and torque measurements. Wake-foil interactions that yield improvements in trailing foil performance are analyzed with time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. Constructive and destructive wake-foil interactions are compared, and it was determined that trailing foil performance could be improved by either avoiding interactions with wake vortices or by interacting directly with them. The latter configuration takes advantage of the wake vortex, and does not see power loss during the oscillation cycle. System power from the two foils is maximized when the leading foil is operated at an intermediate maximum angle of attack range, and when the trailing foil avoids collisions with wake vortices. This optimal array configuration sees both foils operating with different kinematics compared to the optimal kinematics for a single oscillating foil.</description>

      <title>Simulating incompressible flows over complex geometries using the shifted boundary method with incomplete adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the shifted boundary method (SBM) to the simulation of incompressible fluid flow using immersed octree meshes. Previous work on SBM for fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of immersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated computational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate boundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The resulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids. Simulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the Octree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to simulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Scheme Based On Positivity Preservation For Multi-component Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a kinetic model based on flexible velocities for the multi-component Euler equations. Our kinetic model comprises of two velocities in 1D and three velocities in 2D. The velocities in 2D are aligned to the cell-interface such that the resulting macroscopic normal flux is locally one-dimensional. The magnitude of these velocities is set to satisfy positivity preservation conditions for first order accuracy, under a CFL-like limiting condition on the time step. However, at a stationary contact discontinuity, the definition of the velocities is modified to ensure an exact capture. The basic numerical scheme is extended to third order accuracy using a Chakravarthy-Osher type flux limited approach along with Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method. Some benchmark 1D and 2D test cases are solved, including shock-bubble interaction test cases, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Dye Attenuation Without Dye: Quantifying Concentration Fields with Short-wave Infrared Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dye attenuation, or photometric imaging, is an optical technique commonly used in fluid dynamics to measure tracer concentration fields and fluid thicknesses under the assumption that the motion of the dye is representative of the fluid motion and that its presence does not affect the behaviour of the system. However, in some systems, particularly living biological systems or those with strong chemical interactions and reactions, the addition of dye may non-trivially influence the system and may not follow the fluid containing it.
  To overcome this, we demonstrate how short-wave infrared imaging can be used to measure concentration and height profiles of water and other liquids without the introduction of dye for heights down to 0.2mm with spatial and temporal resolutions of the order of 50 microns per pixel and 120 fps respectively. We showcase the utility of this technique by demonstrating its ability to accurately track the temporal evolution of the total water content of two model systems, namely a water drop spreading on a glass slide and spreading within a hydrogel sheet, validating both against an analytical mass balance. Finally, we discuss how the spectral resolution of the present setup could be increased to the point that concentrations within a multi-component system containing more than one type of liquid could be quantified.</description>

      <title>NeuralFluid: Neural Fluidic System Design and Control with Differentiable Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework to explore neural control and design of complex fluidic systems with dynamic solid boundaries. Our system features a fast differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with solid-fluid interface handling, a low-dimensional differentiable parametric geometry representation, a control-shape co-design algorithm, and gym-like simulation environments to facilitate various fluidic control design applications. Additionally, we present a benchmark of design, control, and learning tasks on high-fidelity, high-resolution dynamic fluid environments that pose challenges for existing differentiable fluid simulators. These tasks include designing the control of artificial hearts, identifying robotic end-effector shapes, and controlling a fluid gate. By seamlessly incorporating our differentiable fluid simulator into a learning framework, we demonstrate successful design, control, and learning results that surpass gradient-free solutions in these benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>WindsorML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>A theoretical model for compressible bubble dynamics considering phase transition and migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel theoretical model for bubble dynamics is established that simultaneously accounts for the liquid compressibility, phase transition, oscillation, migration, ambient flow field, etc. The bubble dynamics equations are presented in a unified and concise mathematical form with clear physical meanings and extensibility. The bubble oscillation equation can be simplified to the Keller-Miksis equation by neglecting the effects of phase transition and bubble migration. The present theoretical model effectively captures the experimental results for bubbles generated in free fields, near free surfaces, adjacent to rigid walls, and in the vicinity of other bubbles. Based on the present theory, we explore the effect of the bubble content by changing the vapor proportion inside the cavitation bubble for an initial high-pressure bubble. It is found that the energy loss of the bubble shows a consistent increase with increasing Mach number and initial vapor proportion. However, the radiated pressure peak by the bubble at the collapse stage increases with the decreasing Mach number and increasing vapor proportion. The energy analyses of the bubble reveal that the presence of vapor inside the bubble not only directly contributes to the energy loss of the bubble through phase transition but also intensifies the bubble collapse, which leads to greater radiation of energy into the surrounding flow field due to the fluid compressibility.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of an autophoretic particle near a permeable interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the autophoretic motion of a spherical active particle interacting chemically and hydrodynamically with its fluctuating environment in the limit of rapid diffusion and slow viscous flow. Then, the chemical and hydrodynamic fields can be expressed in terms of integrals. The resulting boundary-domain integral equations provide a direct way of obtaining the traction on the particle, requiring the solution of linear integral equations. An exact solution for the chemical and hydrodynamic problems is obtained for a particle in an unbounded domain. For motion near boundaries, we provide corrections to the unbounded solutions in terms of chemical and hydrodynamic Green's functions, preserving the dissipative nature of autophoresis in a viscous fluid for all physical configurations. Using this, we give the fully stochastic update equations for the Brownian trajectory of an autophoretic particle in a complex environment. First, we analyse the Brownian dynamics of particles capable of complex motion in the bulk. We then introduce a chemically permeable planar surface of two immiscible liquids in the vicinity of the particle and provide explicit solutions to the chemo-hydrodynamics of this system. Finally, we study the case of an isotropically phoretic particle hovering above an interface as a function of interfacial solute permeability and viscosity contrast.</description>
