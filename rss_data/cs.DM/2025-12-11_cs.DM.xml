      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n x n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. This reveals a connection between magic square constraints and statistical structure: we prove that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We introduce a covariance energy functional -- the sum of squared covariances with row, column, and diagonal indicator variables -- and prove for n=3 (via exhaustive enumeration) that its zeros are precisely the magic squares. Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders. Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D_4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>The non-existence of some Moore polygons and spectral Moore bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum order $v(k,\theta)$ of a connected $k$-regular graph whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $\theta$. From Alon-Boppana and Serre, we know that $v(k,\theta)$ is finite when $\theta &lt; 2\sqrt{k-1}$ while the work of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava implies that $v(k,\theta)$ is infinite if $\theta\geq 2\sqrt{k-1}$. Cioab\u{a}, Koolen, Nozaki, and Vermette obtained a general upper bound on $v(k, \theta)$ via Nozaki's linear programming bound and determined many values of $v(k,\theta)$. The graphs attaining this bound are distance-regular and are called Moore polygons. Damerell and Georgiacodis proved that there are no Moore polygons of diameter $6$ or more. For smaller diameters, there are infinitely many Moore polygons.
  We complement these results by proving two nonexistence results for Moore polygons with specific parameters. We also determine new values of $v(k,\theta)$: $v(4, \sqrt{2}) = 14$ and $v(5, \sqrt{2}) = v(5,\sqrt{5}-1)=16$. The former is achieved by the co-Heawood graph, and the latter by the folded $5$-cube. We verify that any connected $5$-regular graph with second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ exceeding $1$ satisfies $\lambda_2 \geq \sqrt{5} - 1$, and that the unique $5$-regular graph attaining equality in this bound has $10$ vertices. We prove a stronger form of a 2015 conjecture of Kolokolnikov related to the second eigenvalue of cubic graphs of given order, and observe that other recent results on the second eigenvalue of regular graphs are consequences of the general upper bound theorem on $v(k,\theta)$ mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</description>

      <title>An $O(\log \log n)$-approximate budget feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a randomized budget-feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations that achieves a substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.</description>
