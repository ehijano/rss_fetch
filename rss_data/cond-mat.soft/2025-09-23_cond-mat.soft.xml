      <title>Pure hydrodynamic instabilities in active jets of "puller" microalgae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids can develop spontaneous flow instabilities and complex patterns. However, spatio-temporal control of active particles has remained challenging, despite its relevance in biological and applied contexts. Here, we harnessed phototaxis to steer millions of swimming ``puller" Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae to create active jets and control both pearling and buckling instabilities through the preferential orientation of the cells. Our experiments, supported by a full analytical model and simulations, confirm long-standing predictions that self-generated flows can lead to jet destabilization. Our results further indicate that pullers can behave analogously to pushers when their orientation is properly tuned, and demonstrate how light enables efficient control of active fluids.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Instabilities of Active Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combination of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations, we investigate the stability of coherent structures in a suspension of strongly aligned active swimmers. We show that a dilute jet of pullers undergoes a pearling instability, while a jet of pushers exhibits a helical (or, in two dimensions, zigzag) instability. We further characterise the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities, deriving exact and approximate solutions for the spreading and mutual attraction of puller clusters, as well as the wavelength coarsening of the helical instability. Our theoretical predictions closely match the experimentally observed wavelengths, timescales, and flow fields in suspensions of photophobic algae, as well as results from direct numerical simulations. These findings reveal the intrinsic instability mechanisms of aligned active suspensions and demonstrate that coherent structures can be destabilised by the flows they generate.</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of hydrophobicity and electrostatics on the particle-scale dynamics and rheology of dense microgel suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergo a reversible volume phase transition at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT, in aqueous media. Although the particles shrink in size as the temperature is raised beyond the VPTT, Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transform from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT, due to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can be significant even below the VPTT and can result in the emergence of attractive gel-like phases. We achieve this by incorporating polar salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-polar additives such as sucrose, to the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of polar salts because of the combined effects of ionic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Thermal History Asymmetry and Dissipation in Dense Colloidal Microgel Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the final temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events and found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM glasses subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.</description>

      <title>A simple time coarse graining method for molecular dynamics simulations of liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering molecular dynamic simulations as a stochastic method, we investigate the possibility of time coarse graining the simulations. Similarly to Boltzmann inversion method in spatial coarse graining, which begins with a free energy called potential of mean force, we test the effect of a generalized potential of mean force that uses the distinct part of the Van Hove correlation function with a characteristic time different from zero. We show that the method is approximately equivalent to replace the hard core of the original potential by a smooth harmonic function. We then compare the results of simulations using the modified potential and the original one. Results show that this simple modification of the potential, namely replacing the short range wall with a smooth quadratic law, leads to a shift in the time step resulting in the same dynamics than the original potential function but with a much larger time step.</description>

      <title>A facilitation-induced fluidization transition in supercooled water triggered by a few active molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an activation mechanism reproducing facilitation, a dynamic phase transition triggered by a few active molecules was recently found in a supercooled model liquid. Prompted by this finding we investigate the presence of a similar transition in supercooled water. We find the presence of the phase transition in water despite the numerous anomalies of water, suggesting universality of the transition. The transition appears at constant temperature, being only induced by the motion of a small percentage of active molecules and the system cooperativity. We observe that cooperative motions strongly increase at the transition and do not disappear when the medium viscosity drops. An increase of temperature is needed to make the cooperative motions disappear, suggesting a connection to the kinetic energy to potential energy ratio instead of the medium viscosity.</description>

      <title>Arrested phase separation and chiral symmetry breaking in active dumbbells under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the phase separation and aggregation dynamics of active dumbbell particles in two-dimensions subjected to shear.
  We find that the growth of the phase-separated region is arrested when shear is applied, with the average clusters size plateauing towards a value $R_s$ that remains constant over time. While activity enhances the resilience of clusters against shear-induced breakup, $R_s$ decreases with growing shear rate $\dot\gamma$, with an intermediate regime where $R_s\propto \dot\gamma^{-1}$. We find that clusters in the stationary state are progressively less polarized and increasingly elongated with increasing shear. At the same time, we find a breaking in chiral symmetry of both rotation direction and internal organization of clusters: typically, dumbbells point towards the cluster center with a small non-zero angle, such that the active torque opposes the shear torque, with cluster's angular velocity well captured by a simplified analytical model. We argue this conformation makes clusters more stable against shear.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic properties of tumor spheroids revealed by a microfluidic compression device and a modified power law model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity - the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of breast tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device and a theoretical power law model. Breast tumor cells at varying malignant levels; a non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were used. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation curves can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. Together, these results highlight that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue.</description>

      <title>Linear Viscoelasticity of Dilute Solutions of Semiflexible Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear viscoelastic response of dilute solutions of semiflexible polymers is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring chains. The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in dilute solutions. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range.</description>

      <title>Selective reflection of light in glassforming ternary liquid crystalline mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two ternary liquid crystalline mixtures are formulated and investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Paraelectric smectic A*, ferroelectric smectic C*, and antiferroelectric smectic C$_A$* phases are detected. The glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase is formed at moderate cooling rates. One mixture shows a strong thermochromic effect in the smectic C$_A$* phase and selectively reflects blue light in the glassy state. Both mixtures reflect either green or red light in the smectic C* phase, depending on temperature treatment: whether the sample is cooled or heated, or at which rate the temperature changes.</description>

      <title>Topological Mechanics of Entangled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

      <title>Folding-unfolding transition of active polymer on the reconfiguration of bidirectional tangential active force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of active stress on the conformational dynamics of a polymer has drawn significant interest due to its potential applications in understanding the energy landscape of protein structures, buckling of biopolymers, genomic spatial organization, and their large scale coherent dynamics. We present a model of bidirectional active force that acts along the polymer's tangent, with its direction stochastically reversing between head to tail and tail to head orientations. The active polymer shows a structural transition from a random coil like state to a compressed state with variations in the active force, directional (polarity) reversal rate, and their fraction. Furthermore, the polymer re-swells and stretches more than its passive limit for a large active force. The polymer's radius of gyration follows the ideal chain-like scaling relation in both the compressed and swelled states. The bidirectional active force also drives dynamical transitions, where the effective diffusivity abruptly shifts from a linear to quadratic increase. Similarly, in the regime of large activity, the linear decrease of the longest relaxation time of the polymer changes to a power law behavior. We have shown that the active polymer's conformational, relaxation, and diffusive behaviors display a transition from an active polar linear polymer model (APLP) to an active Brownian particle (ABP) polymer model with the increase in the fraction of the opposite polarity and their reconfiguration time.</description>

      <title>Random functions as data compressors for machine learning of molecular processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is rapidly transforming the way molecular dynamics simulations are performed and analyzed, from materials modeling to studies of protein folding and function. ML algorithms are often employed to learn low-dimensional representations of conformational landscapes and to cluster trajectories into relevant metastable states. Most of these algorithms require selecting a small number of features that describe the problem of interest. Although deep neural networks can tackle large numbers of input features, the training costs increase with input size, which makes the selection of a subset of features mandatory for most problems of practical interest. Here, we show that random nonlinear projections can be used to compress large feature spaces and make computations faster without substantial loss of information. We describe an efficient way to produce random projections and then exemplify the general procedure for protein folding. For our test cases NTL9 and the double-norleucin variant of the villin headpiece, we find that random compression retains the core static and dynamic information of the original high dimensional feature space and makes trajectory analysis more robust.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale sucrose conformational dynamics in aqueous solution via molecular dynamics methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics methods have proven their applicability for the reproduction and prediction of molecular conformations during the last decades. However, most of works considered dilute solutions and relatively short trajectories that limit insights into conformational dynamics. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics of sucrose in aqueous solution using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. For the most of the calculations we use the OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A-LBCC force field, but we also utilize OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A and GLYCAM06 for the comparison. We focused on the glycosidic linkage conformers and their lifetimes, glucopyranose and fructofuranose ring puckering. Our findings indicate that the $^1\mathrm{C}_4$ glucopyranose ring conformation can stabilize the sucrose conformer, appeared only in the GLYCAM06 and OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A force fields. All the results are strengthened by comparison with the available experimental data on NMR J-coupling constants and ultrasonic spectra.</description>

      <title>Cycling and tensed cells interpenetrated by non-cycling and compressed cells form a critical epithelial reticulum</title>

Abstract: With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.</description>

      <title>Ductile fracture of HDPE thin films: failure mechanisms and tuning of fracture properties by bonding a rubber layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) thin films, while inherently ductile, exhibit poor flaw tolerance. Our experiments show that they fail prematurely not at the point of maximum stretch, but at the boundary of a necked region or notch-tip plastic zone. This study investigates this counter-intuitive failure mechanism and demonstrates how an elastomeric interlayer can mitigate it to enhance toughness. Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched, pure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and HDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that failure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion. Instead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that depends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain. This damage localizes initially at the notch or neck center, but migrates into a "hotspot" at the neck/plastic zone boundary, matching the observed crack initiation site. The addition of a soft SEPS interlayer fundamentally alters this behavior by suppressing the ductile damage, causing the failure mechanism to switch from being damage-driven at the neck/plastic zone boundary to being stretch-driven at the notch tip. This switch enhances flaw tolerance and stretchability by relocating and delaying fracture initiation in both defect-free and notched geometries. This work exposes the failure mechanism in HDPE thin films and provides a mechanistically-grounded framework for toughening ductile polymers by manipulating the competition between damage and stretch localization.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Interrelation Between Elastic Moduli in Critically Elastic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critically elastic materials - those that are rigid with a single state of self-stress - can be generated from parent systems with two states of self-stress by the removal of one of many constraints. We show that the elastic moduli of the resulting homogeneous and isotropic daughter systems are interrelated by a universal functional form parametrized by properties of the parent. In simulations of both spring networks and packings of soft spheres, judicious choice of parent systems and bond removal allows for the selection of a wide variety of moduli and Poisson's ratios in the critically elastic systems, providing a framework for versatile deterministic selection of mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Slow modulation of the contraction patterns in Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a model for self-organisation and coordination of contractile activity at large spatial scales. This self-organisation largely results from cytoplasmic flows generated by propagating contractile waves of the actomyosin cortex. In addition to these relatively fast travelling waves, complex slow modulations of the contractile activity have been observed on timescales much longer than the primary oscillation period; these slow dynamics are however scarcely characterised. Here we characterise these slow modulations by confining organisms inside annular geometries. We quantify contractile activity simultaneously across the entire organism on long time scales, exhibiting correlations between contractile wave direction, amplitude modulation, and the moving mean vein diameter. We observe travelling and alternating wave patterns: travelling wave periods scale clearly with system size, while alternating wave periods remain broadly distributed and probe larger values as the system size increases. Strikingly, the measured periods align with integer multiples of an intrinsic modulation time scale obtained independently from statistical analysis. These observations support the hypothesis that transport of a slowly advected chemical agent, which locally modifies membrane/cortex mechanical properties, underpins the observed slow modulation dynamics, accounting for the coordination across the organism on long time scales.</description>

      <title>Extending the capillary wave model to include the effect of bending rigidity: X-ray reflectivity and diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface roughness of a thin film at a liquid interface exhibits contributions of thermally excited fluctuations. This thermal roughness depends on temperature (T), surface tension ($\gamma$) and elastic material properties, specifically the bending modulus ($\kappa$) of the film. A non-zero $\kappa$ suppresses the thermal roughness at small length scales compared to an interface with zero $\kappa$, as expressed by the power spectral density (PSD) of the thermal roughness. The description of the X-ray scattering of the standard Capillary Wave Model (CWM), that is valid for zero $\kappa$, is extended to include the effect of $\kappa$. The extended CWM (eCWM) provides a single analytical form for both the specular XRR and the diffuse scattering around the specular reflection, and recovers the expression of the CWM at its zero $\kappa$ limit. This new theoretical approach enables the use of single-shot grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering (GIXOS) measurements for characterizing the structure of thin films on a liquid surface. The eCWM analysis approach decouples the thermal roughness factor from the surface scattering signal, providing direct access to the intrinsic surface-normal structure of the film and its bending modulus. Moreover, the eCWM facilitates the calculation of reflectivity at any desired resolution (pseudo XRR approach). The transformation into pseudo XRR provides the benefit of using widely available XRR software to perform GIXOS analysis. The extended range of the vertical scattering vector (Qz) available with the GIXOS-pseudo XRR approach allows for a higher spatial resolution than with conventional XRR. Experimental results are presented for various lipid systems, showing strong agreement between conventional specular XRR and pseudo XRR methods. This agreement validates the proposed approach and highlights its utility for analyzing soft, thin films.</description>

      <title>Wallpaper Group-Based Mechanical Metamaterials: Dataset Including Mechanical Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. The tool is also highly interactive and customizable, allowing the user to perform deployment simulations of kirigami structures under different environmental setups and material properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: Recently published preprint (A. Ashkinazi, H.Chhabra, A.El.Moumane, M.M.C.Tortora, J.P.K. Doye, Chirality transfer in lyotropic twist-bend nematics, arXiv:2508.03544v1 (2025)) has reawakened also interest to various mechanisms of chirality transfer from microscopic (molecular) level into the chirality of the structure. In this communication we present a simple theoretical analysis how the transfer occurs for the Landau model of phase transition between cholesteric and chiral twist-bend liquid crystals. We found that the sign of the chiral heliconical spiral is always opposite to that of the cholesteric. Physics behind this relation is based on the orthogonality of the cholesteric director and vector order parameter of the heliconical phase.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</description>

      <title>X-ray free-electron laser observation of giant and anisotropic magnetostriction in $\beta$-O$_{2}$ at 110 Tesla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where a considerable magnetostriction is expected. However, the microscopic observation of the magnetostriction above 100 T has been hindered due to the short pulse duration of $\mu$-seconds and the coil's destruction. Here, we report the observation of the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim 1$ % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal, $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the newly developed portable 100 T generator (PINK-02). The very soft and anisotropic response of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ should originate in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, and also the frustration of spin and lattice on the triangular network. The XFEL experiment above 100 T using PINK-02 enables microscopic investigations on materials' properties at high magnetic fields, providing insights into how spins contribute to the stability of crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>
