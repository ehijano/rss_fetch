      <title>Free differential modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categorical models of the exponential modality of linear logic will often, but not always, support an operation of differentiation. When they do, we speak of a monoidal differential modality; when they do not, we have merely a monoidal coalgebra modality. More generally, there are notions of differential modality and coalgebra modality which stand in the same relation, but which move outside the realm of linear logic; they model important structures such as smooth differentiation on Euclidean space.
  In this paper, we show that, in a suitably well-behaved k-linear symmetric monoidal category, each (monoidal) coalgebra modality can be freely completed to a (monoidal) differential modality. In particular, we prove the existence of an initial monoidal differential modality, which, even in simple examples such as the category of sets and relations, yields new models of differential linear logic.
  Key to our proofs is the concept of an algebraically-free commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category. A commutative monoid $M$ is said to be algebraically-free on an object $X$ if actions by the monoid $M$ correspond to self-commuting actions by the mere object $X$. Along the way, we study the theory of algebraically-free commutative monoids and self-commuting actions, and their interplay with differential modality structure.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Foundation of Monetary Accounting by Diagrams of Categorical Universals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a category theoretical formulation of the Monetary Macroeconomic Accounting Theory (MoMaT) of Men\'endez and Winschel [2025]. We take macroeconomic (national) accounting systems to be composed from microeconomic double-entry systems with real and monetary units of accounts. Category theory is the compositional grammar and module system of mathematics which we use to lift micro accounting consistency to the macro level. The main function of money in MoMaT is for the repayment of loans and not for the exchange of goods, bridging the desynchronisation of input and output payments of producers. Accordingly, temporal accounting consistency is at the macroeconomic level. We show that the accounting for macroeconomies organised by a division of labor can be consistent and stable as a prerequisite for risk and GDP sharing of societies. We exemplify the theory by five sectoral agents of Labor and Resource owners, a Company as the productive sector, a Capitalist for profits, and a Bank as the financial sector providing loans to synchronise the micro and the macro levels of an economy. The dynamics is described by eight sectoral macroeconomic bookings in each period demonstrating stable convergence of the MoMaT in numerical simulations. The categorical program implements a consistent evolution of hierarchical loan repayment contracts by an endofunctor. The universal constructions of a limit verify all constraints as the sectoral investment and learning function at the macroeconomic level. The dual colimit computes the aggregated informations at the macro level as usual in the mathematics of transitions from local to global structures. We use visual diagrams to make complex economic relationships intuitive. This paper is meant to map economic to categorical concepts to enable interdisciplinary collaboration for digital twins of monetary accounting systems.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of infinite summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic framework in which to study infinite sums is proposed, complementing and augmenting the usual topological tools. The framework subsumes numerous examples in the literature. It is developed using many varied examples, with a particular emphasis on infinitizing the usual group and ring axioms. Comparing these examples reveals that a few key algebraic properties play a crucial role in the behaviors of different forms of infinite summation. Special attention is given to associativity, which is particularly difficult to properly infinitize. In that context, there is an important technique called the Eilenberg-Mazer swindle that is studied and greatly generalized.
  Some special properties are singled out as potential axioms. Interactions between these potential axioms are analyzed, and numerous results explore how to impose new axioms while retaining old ones. In some cases the axioms classify or categorize a given example. Surprisingly, such axiomatizations are very concise, relying on only a handful of natural conditions.
  These investigations reveal more precisely the part that topology plays in the formation of infinite sums. Special attention is given to the methods of partial summation and unconditional summation. In the opposite direction, it is proved that from the infinite sums alone one can create a refined topology, lying between the original topology and its sequential coreflection. Another especially interesting application of these ideas is the construction of new algebraic quotient structures that retain the ability to handle infinite summation.</description>

      <title>Enriched model categories and the Dold-Kan correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monoidal properties of the Dold-Kan correspondence have been studied in homotopy theory, notably by Schwede and Shipley. Changing the enrichment of an enriched, tensored, and cotensored category along the Dold-Kan correspondence does not preserve the tensoring nor the cotensoring. More generally, what happens to an enriched model category if we change the enrichment along a weak monoidal Quillen pair? We prove a change of base theorem that describes which properties are preserved and which are weakened.</description>

      <title>On the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries. These are simplicial and cubical sets with additional maps expressing the symmetries of simplices and cubes. We consider the chain complex computing the homology groups in either case. We show for coefficients in fields of characteristic $0$ that the sub-complex generated by degeneracies (simplicial case) or connections (cubical case) together with all $x - sgn(t)tx$ for symmetries $t$ and chains $x$ is acyclic. In particular, it follows that quotienting by this sub-complex yields a chain complex with isomorphic homology. The latter leads to structural insight and a speedup in explicit computations. We also exhibit examples which show that acyclicity does not hold for general coefficient rings $R$.</description>

      <title>Branching space of precubical set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>

      <title>Dagger-Drazin Inverses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverses that can be defined for endomorphisms in any category. A natural question to ask is whether one can somehow extend the notion of Drazin inverse to arbitrary maps - not simply endomorphisms. It turns out that this is possible and, indeed, natural to do so for dagger categories. This paper, thus, introduces the notion of a dagger-Drazin inverse, which is a new kind of generalized inverse appropriate for arbitrary maps in a dagger category. This inverse is closely related to the Drazin inverse, for having dagger-Drazin inverses is equivalent to asking that positive maps have Drazin inverses. Moreover, dagger-Drazin inverses are also closely related to Moore-Penrose inverses as we observe that a map has a Moore-Penrose inverse if and only if it is a Drazin inverse. Furthermore, we explain how Drazin inverses of opposing pairs correspond precisely to dagger-Drazin inverses in cofree dagger categories. We also give examples of dagger-Drazin inverses for matrices over (involutive) fields, bounded linear operators, and partial injections.</description>

      <title>On Traces in Categories of Contractions</title>

Abstract: Traced monoidal categories are used to model processes that can feed their outputs back to their own inputs, abstracting iteration. The category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with the direct sum tensor is not traced. But surprisingly, in 2014, Bartha showed that the monoidal subcategory of isometries is traced. The same holds for coisometries, unitary maps, and contractions. This suggests the possibility of feeding outputs of quantum processes back to their own inputs, analogous to iteration. In this paper, we show that Bartha's result is not specifically tied to Hilbert spaces, but works in any dagger additive category with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses (a natural dagger-categorical generalization of inverses).</description>

      <title>Rewriting Modulo Traced Comonoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we adapt previous work on rewriting string diagrams using hypergraphs to the case where the underlying category has a traced comonoid structure, in which wires can be forked and the outputs of a morphism can be connected to its input. Such a structure is particularly interesting because any traced Cartesian (dataflow) category has an underlying traced comonoid structure. We show that certain subclasses of hypergraphs are fully complete for traced comonoid categories: that is to say, every term in such a category has a unique corresponding hypergraph up to isomorphism, and from every hypergraph with the desired properties, a unique term in the category can be retrieved up to the axioms of traced comonoid categories. We also show how the framework of double pushout rewriting (DPO) can be adapted for traced comonoid categories by characterising the valid pushout complements for rewriting in our setting. We conclude by presenting a case study in the form of recent work on an equational theory for sequential circuits: circuits built from primitive logic gates with delay and feedback. The graph rewriting framework allows for the definition of an operational semantics for sequential circuits.</description>

      <title>Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and controlling certain quantum circuits. Additionally, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form g; f; g-dagger. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design.  One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit g ; f; g-dagger directly from g, f, and g-dagger, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only f needs to be controlled; the circuits g and g-dagger need not even be controllable.
  In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category R to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category N, which encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation.  Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023.  We give an abstract categorical semantics, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics.</description>

Abstract: Using the notion of short directed path, we introduce the branching space of a multipointed $d$-space. We prove that for any q-cofibrant multipointed $d$-space, it is homeomorphic to the branching space of the q-cofibrant flow obtained by applying the categorization functor. As an application, we deduce a purely topological proof of the invariance of the branching space and of the branching homology of cellular multipointed $d$-spaces up to globular subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology.</description>
