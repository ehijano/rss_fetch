      <title>RL-based Control of UAS Subject to Significant Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based control framework for position and attitude control of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) subjected to significant disturbance that can be associated with an uncertain trigger signal. The proposed method learns the relationship between the trigger signal and disturbance force, enabling the system to anticipate and counteract the impending disturbances before they occur. We train and evaluate three policies: a baseline policy trained without exposure to the disturbance, a reactive policy trained with the disturbance but without the trigger signal, and a predictive policy that incorporates the trigger signal as an observation and is exposed to the disturbance during training. Our simulation results show that the predictive policy outperforms the other policies by minimizing position deviations through a proactive correction maneuver. This work highlights the potential of integrating predictive cues into RL frameworks to improve UAS performance.</description>

      <title>Design Activity for Robot Faces: Evaluating Child Responses To Expressive Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expressiveness plays a crucial role in a robot's ability to engage and interact with children. Prior research has shown that expressive robots can enhance child engagement during human-robot interactions. However, many robots used in therapy settings feature non-personalized, static faces designed with traditional facial feature considerations, which can limit the depth of interactions and emotional connections. Digital faces offer opportunities for personalization, yet the current landscape of robot face design lacks a dynamic, user-centered approach. Specifically, there is a significant research gap in designing robot faces based on child preferences. Instead, most robots in child-focused therapy spaces are developed from an adult-centric perspective. We present a novel study investigating the influence of child-drawn digital faces in child-robot interactions. This approach focuses on a design activity with children instructed to draw their own custom robot faces. We compare the perceptions of social intelligence (PSI) of two implementations: a generic digital face and a robot face, personalized using the user's drawn robot faces. The results of this study show the perceived social intelligence of a child-drawn robot was significantly higher compared to a generic face.</description>

      <title>Threading the Needle: Test and Evaluation of Early Stage UAS Capabilities to Autonomously Navigate GPS-Denied Environments in the DARPA Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DARPA Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program (2015 - 2018) served as a significant milestone in the development of UAS, particularly for autonomous navigation through unknown GPS-denied environments. Three performing teams developed UAS using a common hardware platform, focusing their contributions on autonomy algorithms and sensing. Several experiments were conducted that spanned indoor and outdoor environments, increasing in complexity over time. This paper reviews the testing methodology developed in order to benchmark and compare the performance of each team, each of the FLA Phase 1 experiments that were conducted, and a summary of the Phase 1 results.</description>

      <title>External-Wrench Estimation for Aerial Robots Exploiting a Learned Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an external wrench estimator that uses a hybrid dynamics model consisting of a first-principles model and a neural network. This framework addresses one of the limitations of the state-of-the-art model-based wrench observers: the wrench estimation of these observers comprises the external wrench (e.g. collision, physical interaction, wind); in addition to residual wrench (e.g. model parameters uncertainty or unmodeled dynamics). This is a problem if these wrench estimations are to be used as wrench feedback to a force controller, for example. In the proposed framework, a neural network is combined with a first-principles model to estimate the residual dynamics arising from unmodeled dynamics and parameters uncertainties, then, the hybrid trained model is used to estimate the external wrench, leading to a wrench estimation that has smaller contributions from the residual dynamics, and affected more by the external wrench. This method is validated with numerical simulations of an aerial robot in different flying scenarios and different types of residual dynamics, and the statistical analysis of the results shows that the wrench estimation error has improved significantly compared to a model-based wrench observer using only a first-principles model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooperative Perception Through Asynchronous Vehicle to Infrastructure Framework with Delay Mitigation for Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception is a key component of Automated vehicles (AVs). However, sensors mounted to the AVs often encounter blind spots due to obstructions from other vehicles, infrastructure, or objects in the surrounding area. While recent advancements in planning and control algorithms help AVs react to sudden object appearances from blind spots at low speeds and less complex scenarios, challenges remain at high speeds and complex intersections. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technology promises to enhance scene representation for AVs in complex intersections, providing sufficient time and distance to react to adversary vehicles violating traffic rules. Most existing methods for infrastructure-based vehicle detection and tracking rely on LIDAR, RADAR or sensor fusion methods, such as LIDAR-Camera and RADAR-Camera. Although LIDAR and RADAR provide accurate spatial information, the sparsity of point cloud data limits its ability to capture detailed object contours of objects far away, resulting in inaccurate 3D object detection results. Furthermore, the absence of LIDAR or RADAR at every intersection increases the cost of implementing V2I technology. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a V2I framework that utilizes monocular traffic cameras at road intersections to detect 3D objects. The results from the roadside unit (RSU) are then combined with the on-board system using an asynchronous late fusion method to enhance scene representation. Additionally, the proposed framework provides a time delay compensation module to compensate for the processing and transmission delay from the RSU. Lastly, the V2I framework is tested by simulating and validating a scenario similar to the one described in an industry report by Waymo. The results show that the proposed method improves the scene representation and the AV's perception range, giving enough time and space to react to adversary vehicles.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Passive Compliance of Soft Robotics for Physical Human-Robot Collaborative Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work represents an initial benchmark of a large-scale soft robot performing physical, collaborative manipulation of a long, extended object with a human partner. The robot consists of a pneumatically-actuated, three-link continuum soft manipulator mounted to an omni-directional mobile base. The system level configuration of the robot and design of the collaborative manipulation (co-manipulation) study are presented. The initial results, both quantitative and qualitative, are directly compared to previous similar human-human co-manipulation studies. These initial results show promise in the ability for large-scale soft robots to perform comparably to human partners acting as non-visual followers in a co-manipulation task. Furthermore, these results challenge traditional soft robot strength limitations and indicate potential for applications requiring strength and adaptability.</description>

      <title>II-NVM: Enhancing Map Accuracy and Consistency with Normal Vector-Assisted Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".</description>

      <title>CATCH-FORM-ACTer: Compliance-Aware Tactile Control and Hybrid Deformation Regulation-Based Action Transformer for Viscoelastic Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating contact-rich manipulation of viscoelastic objects with rigid robots faces challenges including dynamic parameter mismatches, unstable contact oscillations, and spatiotemporal force-deformation coupling. In our prior work, a Compliance-Aware Tactile Control and Hybrid Deformation Regulation (CATCH-FORM-3D) strategy fulfills robust and effective manipulations of 3D viscoelastic objects, which combines a contact force-driven admittance outer loop and a PDE-stabilized inner loop, achieving sub-millimeter surface deformation accuracy. However, this strategy requires fine-tuning of object-specific parameters and task-specific calibrations, to bridge this gap, a CATCH-FORM-ACTer is proposed, by enhancing CATCH-FORM-3D with a framework of Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT). An intuitive teleoperation system performs Learning from Demonstration (LfD) to build up a long-horizon sensing, decision-making and execution sequences. Unlike conventional ACT methods focused solely on trajectory planning, our approach dynamically adjusts stiffness, damping, and diffusion parameters in real time during multi-phase manipulations, effectively imitating human-like force-deformation modulation. Experiments on single arm/bimanual robots in three tasks show better force fields patterns and thus 10%-20% higher success rates versus conventional methods, enabling precise, safe interactions for industrial, medical or household scenarios.</description>

      <title>CATCH-FORM-3D: Compliance-Aware Tactile Control and Hybrid Deformation Regulation for 3D Viscoelastic Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a framework (CATCH-FORM-3D) for the precise contact force control and surface deformation regulation in viscoelastic material manipulation. A partial differential equation (PDE) is proposed to model the spatiotemporal stress-strain dynamics, integrating 3D Kelvin-Voigt (stiffness-damping) and Maxwell (diffusion) effects to capture the material's viscoelastic behavior. Key mechanical parameters (stiffness, damping, diffusion coefficients) are estimated in real time via a PDE-driven observer. This observer fuses visual-tactile sensor data and experimentally validated forces to generate rich regressor signals. Then, an inner-outer loop control structure is built up. In the outer loop, the reference deformation is updated by a novel admittance control law, a proportional-derivative (PD) feedback law with contact force measurements, ensuring that the system responds adaptively to external interactions. In the inner loop, a reaction-diffusion PDE for the deformation tracking error is formulated and then exponentially stabilized by conforming the contact surface to analytical geometric configurations (i.e., defining Dirichlet boundary conditions). This dual-loop architecture enables the effective deformation regulation in dynamic contact environments. Experiments using a PaXini robotic hand demonstrate sub-millimeter deformation accuracy and stable force tracking. The framework advances compliant robotic interactions in applications like industrial assembly, polymer shaping, surgical treatment, and household service.</description>

      <title>InSPE: Rapid Evaluation of Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure sensing is vital for traffic monitoring at safety hotspots (e.g., intersections) and serves as the backbone of cooperative perception in autonomous driving. While vehicle sensing has been extensively studied, infrastructure sensing has received little attention, especially given the unique challenges of diverse intersection geometries, complex occlusions, varying traffic conditions, and ambient environments like lighting and weather. To address these issues and ensure cost-effective sensor placement, we propose Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement Evaluation (InSPE), a perception surrogate metric set that rapidly assesses perception effectiveness across diverse infrastructure and environmental scenarios with combinations of multi-modal sensors. InSPE systematically evaluates perception capabilities by integrating three carefully designed metrics, i.e., sensor coverage, perception occlusion, and information gain. To support large-scale evaluation, we develop a data generation tool within the CARLA simulator and also introduce Infra-Set, a dataset covering diverse intersection types and environmental conditions. Benchmarking experiments with state-of-the-art perception algorithms demonstrate that InSPE enables efficient and scalable sensor placement analysis, providing a robust solution for optimizing intelligent intersection infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Spectral Normalization for Lipschitz-Constrained Policies on Learning Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in training agile and adaptable controllers for legged robots, enabling them to learn complex locomotion behaviors directly from experience. However, policies trained in simulation often fail to transfer to real-world robots due to unrealistic assumptions such as infinite actuator bandwidth and the absence of torque limits. These conditions allow policies to rely on abrupt, high-frequency torque changes, which are infeasible for real actuators with finite bandwidth.
  Traditional methods address this issue by penalizing aggressive motions through regularization rewards, such as joint velocities, accelerations, and energy consumption, but they require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Alternatively, Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP) enforce finite bandwidth action control by penalizing policy gradients, but their reliance on gradient calculations introduces significant GPU memory overhead. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes Spectral Normalization (SN) as an efficient replacement for enforcing Lipschitz continuity. By constraining the spectral norm of network weights, SN effectively limits high-frequency policy fluctuations while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Experimental evaluations in both simulation and real-world humanoid robot show that SN achieves performance comparable to gradient penalty methods while enabling more efficient parallel training.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Pedestrian Risks in Shared Spaces Through Autonomous Vehicle Experiments on a Fixed Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of research on safety in autonomous vehicles has been conducted in structured and controlled environments. However, there is a scarcity of research on safety in unregulated pedestrian areas, especially when interacting with public transport vehicles like trams. This study investigates pedestrian responses to an alert system in this context by replicating this real-world scenario in an environment using an autonomous vehicle. The results show that safety measures from other contexts can be adapted to shared spaces with trams, where fixed tracks heighten risks in unregulated crossings.</description>

      <title>RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory for Aerial Manipulators in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning for aerial manipulators in constrained environments has typically been limited to known environments or simplified to that of multi-rotors, which leads to poor adaptability and overly conservative trajectories. This paper presents RINGO:~Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</description>

      <title>Human strategies for correcting `human-robot' errors during a laundry sorting task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental models and expectations underlying human-human interaction (HHI) inform human-robot interaction (HRI) with domestic robots. To ease collaborative home tasks by improving domestic robot speech and behaviours for human-robot communication, we designed a study to understand how people communicated when failure occurs. To identify patterns of natural communication, particularly in response to robotic failures, participants instructed Laundrobot to move laundry into baskets using natural language and gestures. Laundrobot either worked error-free, or in one of two error modes. Participants were not advised Laundrobot would be a human actor, nor given information about error modes. Video analysis from 42 participants found speech patterns, included laughter, verbal expressions, and filler words, such as ``oh'' and ``ok'', also, sequences of body movements, including touching one's own face, increased pointing with a static finger, and expressions of surprise. Common strategies deployed when errors occurred, included correcting and teaching, taking responsibility, and displays of frustration. The strength of reaction to errors diminished with exposure, possibly indicating acceptance or resignation. Some used strategies similar to those used to communicate with other technologies, such as smart assistants. An anthropomorphic robot may not be ideally suited to this kind of task. Laundrobot's appearance, morphology, voice, capabilities, and recovery strategies may have impacted how it was perceived. Some participants indicated Laundrobot's actual skills were not aligned with expectations; this made it difficult to know what to expect and how much Laundrobot understood. Expertise, personality, and cultural differences may affect responses, however these were not assessed.</description>

      <title>The Composite Visual-Laser Navigation Method Applied in Indoor Poultry Farming Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08431</link>

Abstract: Indoor poultry farms require inspection robots to maintain precise environmental control, which is crucial for preventing the rapid spread of disease and large-scale bird mortality. However, the complex conditions within these facilities, characterized by areas of intense illumination and water accumulation, pose significant challenges. Traditional navigation methods that rely on a single sensor often perform poorly in such environments, resulting in issues like laser drift and inaccuracies in visual navigation line extraction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite navigation method that integrates both laser and vision technologies. This approach dynamically computes a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensor modality, thereby eliminating the need for physical navigation lines. Experimental validation in actual poultry house environments demonstrates that our method not only resolves the inherent drawbacks of single-sensor systems, but also significantly enhances navigation precision and operational efficiency. As such, it presents a promising solution for improving the performance of inspection robots in complex indoor poultry farming settings.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Data-Association-Free Landmark-Based Localization Using Semidefinite Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a semidefinite relaxation for landmark-based localization with unknown data associations in planar environments. The proposed method simultaneously solves for the optimal robot states and data associations in a globally optimal fashion. Relative position measurements to known landmarks are used, but the data association is unknown in tha tthe robot does not know which landmark each measurement is generated from. The relaxation is shown to be tight in a majority of cases for moderate noise levels. The proposed algorithm is compared to local Gauss-Newton baselines initialized at the dead-reckoned trajectory, and is shown to significantly improve convergence to the problem's global optimum in simulation and experiment.

      <title>Ready, Bid, Go! On-Demand Delivery Using Fleets of Drones with Unknown, Heterogeneous Energy Storage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to transform logistics, reducing delivery time, costs, and emissions. This study addresses an on-demand delivery , in which fleets of UAVs are deployed to fulfil orders that arrive stochastically. Unlike previous work, it considers UAVs with heterogeneous, unknown energy storage capacities and assumes no knowledge of the energy consumption models. We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that combines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV independently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage charge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance. Over time, it refines its policy to bid only for orders within its capability. Simulations using realistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders to the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number of successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform threshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at deployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies for forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to fulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders. Our work provides new insights into long-term deployment of UAV swarms, highlighting the advantages of decentralised energy-aware decision-making coupled with online learning in real-world dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>FindAnything: Open-Vocabulary and Object-Centric Mapping for Robot Exploration in Any Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically accurate and semantically expressive map representations have proven invaluable to facilitate robust and safe mobile robot navigation and task planning. Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Fidelity Calibration for Informative Sim-to-Real Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and navigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands expert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge simulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the reconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity Calibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based diffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual fidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual fidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world dynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us to sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy fine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a) we fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build sequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the diffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may degrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable hallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator calibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse robots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical contribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and real-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot navigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle on snowy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Tactile sensing enables vertical obstacle negotiation for elongate many-legged robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-legged elongated robots show promise for reliable mobility on rugged landscapes. However, most studies on these systems focus on motion planning in the 2D horizontal plane (e.g., translation and rotation) without addressing rapid vertical motion. Despite their success on mild rugged terrains, recent field tests reveal a critical need for 3D behaviors (e.g., climbing or traversing tall obstacles) in real-world application. The challenges of 3D motion planning partially lie in designing sensing and control for a complex high-degree-of-freedom system, typically with over 25 degrees of freedom. To address the first challenge, we propose a tactile antenna system that enables the robot to probe obstacles and gather information about the structure of the environment. Building on this sensory input, we develop a control framework that integrates data from the antenna and foot contact sensors to dynamically adjust the robot's vertical body undulation for effective climbing. With the addition of simple, low-bandwidth tactile sensors, a robot with high static stability and redundancy exhibits predictable climbing performance in complex environments using a simple feedback controller. Laboratory and outdoor experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to climb obstacles up to five times its height. Moreover, the robot exhibits robust climbing capabilities on obstacles covered with flowable, robot-sized random items and those characterized by rapidly changing curvatures. These findings demonstrate an alternative solution to perceive the environment and facilitate effective response for legged robots, paving ways towards future highly capable, low-profile many-legged robots.</description>

      <title>TinyCenterSpeed: Efficient Center-Based Object Detection for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception within autonomous driving is nearly synonymous with Neural Networks (NNs). Yet, the domain of autonomous racing is often characterized by scaled, computationally limited robots used for cost-effectiveness and safety. For this reason, opponent detection and tracking systems typically resort to traditional computer vision techniques due to computational constraints. This paper introduces TinyCenterSpeed, a streamlined adaptation of the seminal CenterPoint method, optimized for real-time performance on 1:10 scale autonomous racing platforms. This adaptation is viable even on OBCs powered solely by Central Processing Units (CPUs), as it incorporates the use of an external Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We demonstrate that, compared to Adaptive Breakpoint Detector (ABD), the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) in scaled autonomous racing, TinyCenterSpeed not only improves detection and velocity estimation by up to 61.38% but also supports multi-opponent detection and estimation. It achieves real-time performance with an inference time of just 7.88 ms on the TPU, significantly reducing CPU utilization 8.3-fold.</description>

      <title>Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for a Quadruped Robot Leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexities in the dynamic model of the legged robots make it necessary to utilize model-free controllers in the task of trajectory tracking. In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning using Human-Aligned Reward Labeling for Autonomous Emergency Braking in Occluded Pedestrian Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective leveraging of real-world driving datasets is crucial for enhancing the training of autonomous driving systems. While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values.</description>

      <title>BiFlex: A Passive Bimodal Stiffness Flexible Wrist for Manipulation in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured, humancentric environments poses a dual challenge: achieving the precision need for delicate free-space operation while ensuring safety during unexpected contact events. Traditional wrists struggle to balance these demands, often relying on complex control schemes or complicated mechanical designs to mitigate potential damage from force overload. In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex. We validate BiFlex under several real-world experimental evaluations, including surface wiping, precise pick-and-place, and grasping under environmental constraints. We demonstrate that BiFlex simplifies control while maintaining precise object manipulation and enhanced safety in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Vector Quantized-Elites: Unsupervised and Problem-Agnostic Quality-Diversity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms have transformed optimization by prioritizing the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions over a single optimal result. However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavioral descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavioral space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavioral space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavioral descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavioral space grid - a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce two key components: behavioral space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching and mobile robot space-covering tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite horizon optimal control problems with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on four robotic motion planning problems. IPDDP2 reliably converges to low optimality error and exhibits local quadratic and global convergence from remote starting points. Notably, we showcase the robustness of IPDDP2 by using it to solve a contact-implicit, joint limited acrobot swing-up problem involving complementarity constraints from a range of initial conditions. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</description>

      <title>PNE-SGAN: Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network for LiDAR Loop Closure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR loop closure detection (LCD) is crucial for consistent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) but faces challenges in robustness and accuracy. Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>DSM: Building A Diverse Semantic Map for 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the growing research and application of multimodal large language models (VLMs) in robotics, there has been an increasing trend of utilizing VLMs for robotic scene understanding tasks. Existing approaches that use VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene information through geometric and visual information, overlooking the extraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding of rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and affordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an ideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective carrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these issues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically designed for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method leverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of objects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a geometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding of grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named DSM-Grounding. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current approaches in tasks like semantic segmentation and 3D Visual Grounding, particularly excelling in overall metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have deployed this method on robots to validate its effectiveness in navigation and grasping tasks.</description>

      <title>SN-LiDAR: Semantic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has begun exploring novel view synthesis (NVS) for LiDAR point clouds, aiming to generate realistic LiDAR scans from unseen viewpoints. However, most existing approaches do not reconstruct semantic labels, which are crucial for many downstream applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception. Unlike images, which benefit from powerful segmentation models, LiDAR point clouds lack such large-scale pre-trained models, making semantic annotation time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose SN-LiDAR, a method that jointly performs accurate semantic segmentation, high-quality geometric reconstruction, and realistic LiDAR synthesis. Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature representation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and leverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the current frame point cloud. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360 demonstrate the superiority of SN-LiDAR in both semantic and geometric reconstruction, effectively handling dynamic objects and large-scale scenes. Codes will be available on https://github.com/dtc111111/SN-Lidar.</description>

      <title>Embodied Image Captioning: Self-supervised Learning Agents for Spatially Coherent Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised method to improve an agent's abilities in describing arbitrary objects while actively exploring a generic environment. This is a challenging problem, as current models struggle to obtain coherent image captions due to different camera viewpoints and clutter. We propose a three-phase framework to fine-tune existing captioning models that enhances caption accuracy and consistency across views via a consensus mechanism. First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.

      <title>Digital Twin Catalog: A Large-Scale Photorealistic 3D Object Digital Twin Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Digital Twin Catalog (DTC), a new large-scale photorealistic 3D object digital twin dataset. A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released at https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/ and we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source.</description>

      <title>MBE-ARI: A Multimodal Dataset Mapping Bi-directional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animal-robot interaction (ARI) remains an unexplored challenge in robotics, as robots struggle to interpret the complex, multimodal communication cues of animals, such as body language, movement, and vocalizations. Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals. The dataset and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/RISELabPurdue/MBE-ARI/, inviting further exploration and development in this critical area.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper develops a novel motion model, called Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model (GMDM), which extends the Dubins model by considering multiple speeds. While the Dubins model produces time-optimal paths under a constant speed constraint, these paths could be suboptimal if this constraint is relaxed to include multiple speeds. This is because a constant speed results in a large minimum turning radius, thus producing paths with longer maneuvers and larger travel times. In contrast, multi-speed relaxation allows for slower speed sharp turns, thus producing more direct paths with shorter maneuvers and smaller travel times. Furthermore, the inability of the Dubins model to reduce speed could result in fast maneuvers near obstacles, thus producing paths with high collision risks.
  In this regard, GMDM provides the motion planners the ability to jointly optimize time and risk by allowing the change of speed along the path. GMDM is built upon the six Dubins path types considering the change of speed on path segments. It is theoretically established that GMDM provides full reachability of the configuration space for any speed selections. Furthermore, it is shown that the Dubins model is a specific case of GMDM for constant speeds. The solutions of GMDM are analytical and suitable for real-time applications. The performance of GMDM in terms of solution quality (i.e., time/time-risk cost) and computation time is comparatively evaluated against the existing motion models in obstacle-free as well as obstacle-rich environments via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that in obstacle-free environments, GMDM produces near time-optimal paths with significantly lower travel times than the Dubins model while having similar computation times. In obstacle-rich environments, GMDM produces time-risk optimized paths with substantially lower collision risks.</description>

      <title>DAG-Plan: Generating Directed Acyclic Dependency Graphs for Dual-Arm Cooperative Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-arm robots offer enhanced versatility and efficiency over single-arm counterparts by enabling concurrent manipulation of multiple objects or cooperative execution of tasks using both arms. However, the coordination of dual-arm systems for long-horizon tasks continues to pose significant challenges, stemming from the intricate temporal and spatial dependencies among sub-tasks, necessitating intelligent decisions regarding the allocation of actions between arms and their optimal execution order. Existing task planning methods predominantly focus on single-arm robots or rely on predefined bimanual operations to use large language models (LLMs) generate task sequence with linear temporal dependency, failing to fully leverage the capabilities of dual-arm systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DAG-Plan, a structured task planning framework tailored for dual-arm robots. DAG-Plan harnesses LLMs to decompose intricate tasks into actionable sub-tasks represented as nodes within a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Critically, DAG-Plan dynamically assigns these sub-tasks to the appropriate arm based on real-time environmental observations, enabling parallel and adaptive execution. We evaluate DAG-Plan on the Dual-Arm Kitchen Benchmark, comprising 5 sequential tasks with 44 sub-tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAG-Plan over directly using LLM to generate linear task sequence, achieving 52.8% higher efficiency compared to the single-arm task planning and 48% higher success rate of the dual-arm task planning. Compared to iterative methods, DAG-Plan improving execution efficiency 84.1% due to its fewer query time. More demos and information are available on https://sites.google.com/view/dag-plan.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Strong r-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong r-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As aerial robots gain traction in industrial applications, there is growing interest in enhancing their physical interaction capabilities. Pushing tasks performed by aerial manipulators have been successfully demonstrated in contact-based inspections. However, more complex industrial applications require these systems to support higher-DoF (Degree of Freedom) manipulators and generate larger forces while pushing (e.g., drilling, grinding). This paper builds on our previous work, where we introduced an aerial vehicle that can dynamically vary its CoM (Center of Mass) location to improve force exertion during interactions. We propose a novel approach to further enhance this system's force generation by optimizing its CoM location during interactions. Additionally, we study the case of this aerial vehicle equipped with a 2-DoF manipulation arm to extend the system's functionality in tool-based tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through simulations, demonstrating the potential of this system for advanced aerial manipulation in practical settings.</description>

      <title>PACER: Preference-conditioned All-terrain Costmap Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous robot navigation, terrain cost assignment is typically performed using a semantics-based paradigm in which terrain is first labeled using a pre-trained semantic classifier and costs are then assigned according to a user-defined mapping between label and cost. While this approach is rapidly adaptable to changing user preferences, only preferences over the types of terrain that are already known by the semantic classifier can be expressed. In this paper, we hypothesize that a machine-learning-based alternative to the semantics-based paradigm above will allow for rapid cost assignment adaptation to preferences expressed over new terrains at deployment time without the need for additional training. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce and study PACER, a novel approach to costmap generation that accepts as input a single birds-eye view (BEV) image of the surrounding area along with a user-specified preference context and generates a corresponding BEV costmap that aligns with the preference context. Using both real and synthetic data along with a combination of proposed training tasks, we find that PACER is able to adapt quickly to new user preferences while also exhibiting better generalization to novel terrains compared to both semantics-based and representation-learning approaches.</description>

      <title>RINO: Accurate, Robust Radar-Inertial Odometry with Non-Iterative Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odometry in adverse weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow, presents significant challenges, as traditional vision and LiDAR-based methods often suffer from degraded performance. Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as a promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper, we present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively loosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry, RINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint extraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive voting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time optimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar module's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter framework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains the global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also dynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during fusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and 0.09{\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, RINO achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Zero-Shot Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the task of Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) under the zero-shot setting. Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively. Moreover, CA-Nav demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world robot deployments across various indoor scenes and instructions.</description>

      <title>Learning Bipedal Locomotion on Gear-Driven Humanoid Robot Using Foot-Mounted IMUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid robots with high-gear ratio actuators remains challenging due to complex actuator dynamics and the absence of torque sensors. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework leveraging foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Instead of pursuing detailed actuator modeling and system identification, we utilize foot-mounted IMU measurements to enhance rapid stabilization capabilities over challenging terrains. Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.</description>

      <title>ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification and Control with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we design formal verification and control algorithms for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees using conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate).
  We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>E-3DGS: Gaussian Splatting with Exposure and Motion Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving 3D reconstruction from images captured under optimal conditions has been extensively studied in the vision and imaging fields. However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient illumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in delivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a transmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras to capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction scenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected in fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework supports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast Reconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF dataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail reconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure. Furthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands. The source code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/MasterHow/E-3DGS.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction in Healthcare: A Study on Nonverbal Communication Cues and Trust Dynamics with NAO Robot Caregivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the population of older adults increases, so will the need for both human and robot care providers. While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions. Despite limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of humanoid robots to improve health monitoring and caregiving for older adults.</description>

      <title>Extendable Long-Horizon Planning via Hierarchical Multiscale Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a novel problem, extendable long-horizon planning-enabling agents to plan trajectories longer than those in training data without compounding errors. To tackle this, we propose the Hierarchical Multiscale Diffuser (HM-Diffuser) and Progressive Trajectory Extension (PTE), an augmentation method that iteratively generates longer trajectories by stitching shorter ones. HM-Diffuser trains on these extended trajectories using a hierarchical structure, efficiently handling tasks across multiple temporal scales. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive Plan Pondering and the Recursive HM-Diffuser, which consolidate hierarchical layers into a single model to process temporal scales recursively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing diffusion-based planners for scalable long-horizon planning.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</description>
