      <title>Metaheuristic Enhanced with Feature-Based Guidance and Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a metaheuristic algorithm enhanced with feature-based guidance that is designed to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). To formulate the proposed guidance, we developed and explained a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model, that is used to formulate the guidance and control the diversity of the solution during the optimization process. We propose a metaheuristic algorithm combining neighborhood search and a novel mechanism of hybrid split and path relinking to implement the proposed guidance. The proposed guidance has proven to give a statistically significant improvement to the proposed metaheuristic algorithm when solving CVRP. Moreover, the proposed guided metaheuristic is also capable of producing competitive solutions among state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Gray codes-an updated survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A combinatorial Gray code for a class of objects is a listing that contains each object from the class exactly once such that any two consecutive objects in the list differ only by a `small change'. Such listings are known for many different combinatorial objects, including bitstrings, combinations, permutations, partitions, triangulations, but also for objects defined with respect to a fixed graph, such as spanning trees, perfect matchings or vertex colorings. This survey provides a comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art of the research on combinatorial Gray codes. In particular, it gives an update on Savage's influential survey [C. D. Savage. A survey of combinatorial Gray codes. SIAM Rev., 39(4):605--629, 1997.], incorporating many more recent developments. We also emphasize the connections to closely related problems in graph theory, algebra, order theory, geometry and algorithms, which embeds this research area into a broader context. Lastly, we collect and propose a number of challenging research problems, thus stimulating new research endeavors.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>
