      <title>Cerebral microbleeds: Association with cognitive decline and pathology build-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral microbleeds, markers of brain damage from vascular and amyloid pathologies, are linked to cognitive decline in aging, but their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether the presence and location of lobar microbleeds are associated with amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-PET, tau tangle formation (tau-PET), and longitudinal cognitive decline. We analyzed 1,573 ADNI participants with MR imaging data and information on the number and location of microbleeds. Associations between lobar microbleeds and pathology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetics, and cognition were examined, focusing on regional microbleeds and domain-specific cognitive decline using ordinary least-squares regression while adjusting for covariates. Cognitive decline was assessed with ADAS-Cog11 and its domain-specific sub-scores. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing at least twice, with a minimum two-year interval between assessments. Among the 1,573 participants (692 women, mean age 71.23 years), 373 participants had microbleeds. The presence of microbleeds was linked to cognitive decline, particularly in the semantic, language, and praxis domains for those with temporal lobe microbleeds. Microbleeds in the overall cortex were associated with language decline. Pathologically, temporal lobe microbleeds were associated with increased tau in the overall cortex, while cortical microbleeds were linked to elevated A$\beta$ in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. In this mixed population, microbleeds were connected to longitudinal cognitive decline, especially in semantic and language domains, and were associated with higher baseline A$\beta$ and tau pathology. These findings suggest that lobar microbleeds should be included in AD diagnostic and prognostic evaluations.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Perceptual Scaling of High Resolution Natural Images Using Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural scenes are of key interest for visual perception. Previous work on natural scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences from stimulus to stimulus. For many purposes it would, however, be desirable to have sets of natural images that vary smoothly along a continuum (for example in order to measure quantitative properties such as thresholds or precisions). This problem has typically been addressed by morphing a source into a target image. However, this approach yields transitions between images that primarily follow their low-level physical features and that can be semantically unclear or ambiguous. Here, in contrast, we used a different approach (Stable Diffusion XL) to synthesise a custom stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions where each image is a clearly interpretable but unique exemplar from the same category. We developed natural scene stimulus sets from six categories with 18 objects each. For each object we generated 10 graded variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. We validated the image set psychophysically in a large sample of participants, ensuring that stimuli for each exemplar have varying levels of perceptual confusability. This image set is of interest for studies on visual perception, attention and short- and long-term memory.</description>

      <title>Seizure Onset Zone Localisation Algorithms with Intracranial EEG: Evaluating Methodological Variations and Targeted Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During clinical treatment for epilepsy, the area of the brain thought to be responsible for pathological activity - known as the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is identified. This is typically performed through visual assessment of EEG recordings; however, this is time consuming and prone to subjective inconsistency. Automated SOZ localisation algorithms provide objective identification of the SOZ by highlighting changes in signal features associated with seizure onset. In this work we investigate how methodological differences in such algorithms can result in different SOZ localisations.
  We analysed ictal intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in 16 subjects (100 seizures) with drug-resistant epilepsy from the SWEZ-ETHZ public database. Through our analysis, we identified a series of key methodological differences that must be considered when designing or selecting a SOZ localisation algorithm. These differences were demonstrated using three distinct algorithms that capture different, but complementary, seizure onset features: Imprint, Epileptogenicity Index (EI), and Low Entropy Map (LEM). We assessed methodological differences at each Decision Point, comparing the resultant SOZ localisations.
  Our independent application of all three algorithms to the same ictal icEEG dataset revealed low agreement between algorithms: 27-60% of seizure onsets were as minimally or non-overlapping (&lt;25% overlap). Therefore, we investigated the effect of three key methodological differences (or Decision Points). Changes at each Decision Point were found to result in significantly different SOZ localisations (p&lt;0.05).
  Our results demonstrate how seemingly small methodological changes can result in large differences in SOZ localisations. We propose that key Decision Points must be considered when using or designing a SOZ localisation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Theta and/or alpha? Neural oscillational substrates for dynamic inter-brain synchrony during mother-child cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.</description>

      <title>Linear-Threshold Network Models for Describing and Analyzing Brain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, an increasing array of control-theoretic methods have been used to study the brain as a complex dynamical system and better understand its structure-function relationship. This article provides an overview on one such family of methods, based on the linear-threshold rate (LTR) dynamics, which arises when modeling the spiking activity of neuronal populations and their impact on each other. LTR dynamics exhibit a wide range of behaviors based on network topologies and inputs, including mono- and multi-stability, limit cycles, and chaos, allowing it to be used to model many complex brain processes involving fast and slow inhibition, multiple time and spatial scales, different types of neural behavior, and higher-order interactions. Here we investigate how the versatility of LTR dynamics paired with concepts and tools from systems and control can provide a computational theory for explaining the dynamical mechanisms enabling different brain processes. Specifically, we illustrate stability and stabilization properties of LTR dynamics and how they are related to goal-driven selective attention, multistability and its relationship with declarative memory, and bifurcations and oscillations and their role in modeling seizure dynamics in epilepsy. We conclude with a discussion on additional properties of LTR dynamics and an outlook on other brain processess that for which they might be play a similar role.</description>

      <title>Towards Homogeneous Lexical Tone Decoding from Heterogeneous Intracranial Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</description>

      <title>L1-Regularized ICA: A Novel Method for Analysis of Task-related fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method of independent component analysis (ICA) in order to extract appropriate features from high-dimensional data. In general, matrix factorization methods including ICA have a problem regarding the interpretability of extracted features. For the improvement of interpretability, it is considered that sparse constraint on a factorized matrix is helpful. With this background, we construct a new ICA method with sparsity. In our method, the L1-regularization term is added to the cost function of ICA, and minimization of the cost function is performed by difference of convex functions algorithm. For the validity of our proposed method, we apply it to synthetic data and real functional magnetic resonance imaging data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

      <title>From Neuronal Packets to Thoughtseeds: A Hierarchical Model of Embodied Cognition in the Global Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel "thoughtseed" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called "thoughtseeds" within the Global Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. The thoughtseed framework offers a promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, with potential applications in understanding consciousness, attention, and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning of video representations from a child's perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Children learn powerful internal models of the world around them from a few years of egocentric visual experience. Can such internal models be learned from a child's visual experience with highly generic learning algorithms or do they require strong inductive biases? Recent advances in collecting large-scale, longitudinal, developmentally realistic video datasets and generic self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are allowing us to begin to tackle this nature vs. nurture question. However, existing work typically focuses on image-based SSL algorithms and visual capabilities that can be learned from static images (e.g. object recognition), thus ignoring temporal aspects of the world. To close this gap, here we train self-supervised video models on longitudinal, egocentric headcam recordings collected from a child over a two year period in their early development (6-31 months). The resulting models are highly effective at facilitating the learning of action concepts from a small number of labeled examples; they have favorable data size scaling properties; and they display emergent video interpolation capabilities. Video models also learn more accurate and more robust object representations than image-based models trained with the exact same data. These results suggest that important temporal aspects of a child's internal model of the world may be learnable from their visual experience using highly generic learning algorithms and without strong inductive biases.</description>

      <title>Excitation-inhibition balance controls information encoding in neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the complex connectivity structure of the brain shapes its information-processing capabilities is a long-standing question. By focusing on a paradigmatic architecture, we study how the neural activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations encodes information on external signals. We show that at long times information is maximized at the edge of stability, where inhibition balances excitation, both in linear and nonlinear regimes. In the presence of multiple external signals, this maximum corresponds to the entropy of the input dynamics. By analyzing the case of a prolonged stimulus, we find that stronger inhibition is instead needed to maximize the instantaneous sensitivity, revealing an intrinsic trade-off between short-time responses and long-time accuracy. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our results pave the way for a deeper information-theoretic understanding of how the balance between excitation and inhibitions controls optimal information-processing in neural populations.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer Predictive Coding: a structured Bayesian inference algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unexpected stimuli induce "error" or "surprise" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC). DCPC differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github.</description>

      <title>How Initial Connectivity Shapes Biologically Plausible Learning in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of initial connectivity on learning has been extensively studied in the context of backpropagation-based gradient descent, but it remains largely underexplored in biologically plausible learning settings. Focusing on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we found that the initial weight magnitude significantly influences the learning performance of biologically plausible learning rules in a similar manner to its previously observed effect on training via backpropagation through time (BPTT). By examining the maximum Lyapunov exponent before and after training, we uncovered the greater demands that certain initialization schemes place on training to achieve desired information propagation properties. Consequently, we extended the recently proposed gradient flossing method, which regularizes the Lyapunov exponents, to biologically plausible learning and observed an improvement in learning performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine the impact of initialization on biologically plausible learning rules for RNNs and to subsequently propose a biologically plausible remedy. Such an investigation could lead to predictions about the influence of initial connectivity on learning dynamics and performance, as well as guide neuromorphic design.</description>
