      <title>Johnson's axioms revisited: Bases for Boolean algebras containing identities of associative type. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is inspired by 1892 paper of Johnson, where he has given an axiomatization for the variety of Boolean algebras (equivalently, for classical propositional calculus). The fact that the axioms of Johnson include the associative law, the most well-known identity of associative type of length 3, led us naturally to the question as to whether there are axiom systems for Boolean algebras that include an identity of associative type, other than the associative law. It turns out that the answer to this question is positive in the strongest sense possible. In fact, corresponding to each of the 14 nonequivalent identities of associative type, there is a base containing that identity. Our goal, in this sequence of papers, of which the present paper is the first, is to describe bases for Boolean algebras, each of which contains at least one identity of associative type of length 3. In this paper, we prove, firstly, that the third axiom of Johnson is redundant. Secondly, we give several equational bases, some 2-bases and some 3-bases, for the variety of Boolean algebras, each containing an identity of associative type, other than the associative law. Each of these bases can be easily converted into an axiomatization for the classical propositional logic, as well.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood and algebraic models for predicate modal logics with $\omega$-rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates neighborhood and algebraic models for predicate modal logics with $\omega$-rules, including non-normal cases. We establish sufficient conditions under which such logics have neighborhood models with constant domains and satisfy the completeness theorem with respect to neighborhood frames with constant domains. Related results for normal modal logics with $\omega$-rules were obtained by Tanaka, while similar results for non-normal modal logics without $\omega$-rules were presented by Arl\'{o}-Costa and Pacuit and by Tanaka. The results presented here extend these works. As applications, we prove that a predicate extension of GL is sound and complete with respect to a class of neighborhood frames with constant domains, and that a predicate common knowledge logic is Kripke incomplete but neighborhood complete.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Analysis of Well-Ordering Principles, Well Quasi-Orders Closure Properties, and $\Sigma_n$-Collection Schema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of well quasi-orders, wqo, is a cornerstone of combinatorics and within wqo theory Kruskal's theorem plays a crucial role. Extending previous proof-theoretic results, we calculate the $\Pi^1_1$ ordinals of two different versions of labelled Kruskal's theorem: $\forall n \,$ $\mbox{KT}_\ell(n)$ and $\mbox{KT}_{\omega}(n)$; denoting, respectively, all the cases of labelled Kruskal's theorem for trees with an upper bound on the branching degree, and the standard Kruskal's theorem for labelled trees.
  In order to reach these computations, a key step is to move from Kruskal's theorem, which regards preservation of wqo's, to an equivalent Well-Ordering Principle (WOP), regarding instead preservation of well-orders. Given an ordinal function $g$, WOP$(g)$ amounts to the following principle $\forall X\, [\mbox{WO}(X) \rightarrow \mbox{WO}(g(X))]$, where $WO(X)$ states that ``$X$ is a well-order''. In our case, the two ordinal functions involved are ${g}_{\forall}(X)=\sup_{n}\vartheta(\Omega^n \cdot X)$ and ${g}_{\omega}(X)=\vartheta(\Omega^{\omega}\! \cdot X)$.
  In addition to the ordinal analysis of Kruskal's theorem and its related WOP, a series of Well Quasi-orders Principles (WQP) is considered. Given a set operation $G$ that preserves the property of being a wqo, its Well Quasi-orders closure Property, WQP$(G)$, is given by the principle $\forall Q\, [Q\, \mbox{wqo} \rightarrow G(Q)\, \mbox{wqo}]$. Conducting this study, unexpected connections with different principles arising from Ramsey and Computational theory, such as RT$^2_{&lt;\infty}$, CAC, ADS, RT$^1_{&lt;\infty}$, turn up.
  Lastly, extending and combining previous results, we achieve also the ordinal analysis of the collection schema $\mbox{B}\Sigma_n$.</description>

      <title>Proof-Theoretic Relations between Higman's and Kruskal's theorem, and Independence Results for Tree-like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higman's lemma and Kruskal's theorem are two of the most celebrated results in the theory of well quasi-orders. In his seminal paper G. Higman obtained what is known as Higman's lemma as a corollary of a more general theorem, dubbed here Higman's theorem. While the lemma deals with finite sequences over a well quasi-order, the theorem is about abstract operations of arbitrary high arity.
  J.B. Kruskal was fully aware of this broader framework: in his seminal paper, he not only applied Higman's lemma at crucial points of his proof but also followed Higman's proof schema. At the conclusion of the paper, Kruskal noted that Higman's theorem is a special case, restricted to trees of finite degree, of his own tree theorem. Although he provided no formal reduction, he included a glossary translating concepts between the tree and algebraic settings. The equivalence between these versions was later clarified by D. Schmidt and M. Pouzet. In this work, we revisit that equivalence to illuminate the proof-theoretical relationships between the two theorems within the base system $RCA_0$, of reverse mathematics.
  Moreover, some independence results over first- and second-orders are treated. In particular, tree-like structures, involving either Ackermannian terms or exponential expressions, are studied unveiling well-foundedness properties that are independent from Peano arithmetic and relevant fragments of second-order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Game}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>
