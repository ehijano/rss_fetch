      <title>Exploring non-perturbative effects on quasi-topological black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of non-perturbative quantum corrections to the entropy of both charged and charged rotating quasi-topological black holes, with a focus on their thermodynamic properties. The negative-valued correction to the entropy for small black holes is found to be unphysical. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of these non-perturbative corrections on other thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, Gibbs free energy, charge density, and mass density, for both types of black holes. Our findings indicate that the sign of the correction parameter plays a crucial role at small horizon radii. Additionally, we assess the stability and phase transitions of these black holes in the presence of non-perturbative corrections. Below the critical point, both the corrected and uncorrected specific heat per unit volume are in an unstable regime. This instability leads to a first-order phase transition, wherein the specific heat transitions from negative to positive values as the system reaches a stable state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Vaidya geometry is investigated for collapsing matter. Compared to other studies, we take into account an anisotropic stress tensor as the source of curvature with an equation of state resembling the MIT bag model form. The energy conditions are generally satisfied. For $r&lt;M(v,r)$ the gravitational field becomes repulsive and the true singularity at $r = 0$ is never reached.</description>

      <title>Dark-Matter Induced Scalarization of Black Holes in Extended Scalar-Tensor-Gauss-Bonnet Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet theory, spontaneous scalarization in the GB\(^-\) regime typically occurs only in rotating black holes, while it is absent in spherically symmetric black holes, a phenomenon known as spin-induced scalarization. However, we find that when the spacetime is permeated by perfect fluid dark matter, spontaneous scalarization can also be induced by dark matter in the GB\(^-\) regime. Analytical calculations reveal that this scalarization occurs when the dark matter parameter \(b/M\) exceeds a critical value \((b/M)_\text{crit}\simeq1.86287\), a threshold determined by the lower boundary of the unstable region for scalar perturbations as the coupling constant approaches negative infinity. Additionally, we verified these findings through numerical analysis of the time evolution of scalar perturbations, identifying the unstable parameter region. The results show that when coupling constant \(-\lambda/M^2\) is small, spontaneous scalarization only occurs near the extremal black hole limit. As \(-\lambda/M^2\) increases, the scalarization region expands; however, its lower boundary remains above \(b/M \simeq 1.86287\), consistent with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>The cosmological constant problem: from Newtonian cosmology to the greatest puzzle of modern theoretical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological constant problem is one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics, since it is deeply rooted in the problematic interplay between quantum fields and gravity. The aim of this work is to review the key conceptual elements needed to formulate the problem and some ideas for a possible solution. I do so by weaving a fil rouge from Newtonian cosmology, through general relativity and the standard model of relativistic cosmology ({\Lambda}-CDM), up to the theory of quantum fields. In the first part, the issues with the application of Newtonian gravity to an infinite and static universe are addressed, observing how a cosmological term in the Poisson equation would stabilize a homogeneous matter distribution. A toy derivation of the Friedman equations using only Newtonian arguments is also shown. In the second part, the conceptual path leading to general relativity and the {\Lambda}-CDM model is laid down, with particular emphasis to the historical introduction of the cosmological constant and its new role after the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Finally, the problem is formulated within the framework of quantum field theory. Its many facets are discussed together with the criticalities in the formulation and some of the leading ideas for its solution are outlined.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Kalb-Ramond black hole on neutrino behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consequences of Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity on neutrino dynamics. The analysis is structured around three key phenomena: the energy output associated with neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the impact of spacetime geometry on the oscillation phases of neutrinos, and the changes in flavor transition probabilities caused by gravitational lensing effects. To complement the theoretical framework, we also carry out a numerical evaluation of neutrino oscillation probabilities, comparing scenarios of normal and inverted mass orderings within a two-flavor approximation.</description>

      <title>Scalar quasinormal modes of gravastars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed investigation of gravastars within the framework of scalar-tensor theories, emphasizing both the background and perturbed levels for trivial and non trivial scalar field. We derive and analyze the background equations governing the equilibrium configurations of gravastars by considering the interaction between matter and scalar field through a conformal transformation. By selecting two forms of the coupling function, we identify distinct physical characteristic that leads to deviations from predictions made by general relativity. We show that that the scalar field has a considerable influence on the compactness parameter. By extending our study to the perturbed level, we show also that quasinormal modes are considerably impacted by the presence of scalar field. New and interesting solutions are found, which are absent in general relativity.</description>

      <title>On the Klein-Gordon bosonic fields in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime with a cosmological constant in rainbow gravity: Bonnor-Melvin Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in the background of the magnetized Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. We first show that the very existence of the sinusoidal term \(\sin^2(\sqrt{2\Lambda}r)\), in the BM space-time metric, suggests that \(\sin^2(\sqrt{2\Lambda}r) \in [0,1],\) which consequently restricts the range of the radial coordinate \(r\) to \(r \in [0,\pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\). Moreover, we show that at \(r = 0\) and \(r = \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\), the magnetized BM-spacetime introduces domain walls (infinitely impenetrable hard walls) within which the KG bosonic fields are allowed to move. Interestingly, the magnetized BM-spacetime introduces not only two domain walls but a series of domain walls. However, we focus on the range \(r \in [0,\pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\). A quantum particle remains indefinitely confined within this range and cannot be found elsewhere. Based on these findings, we report the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in BM-spacetime. We use three pairs of rainbow functions: \( f(\chi) = \frac{1}{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|}, \, h(\chi) = 1 \); \( f(\chi) = (1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|)^{-1}, \, h(\chi) = 1 \); and \( f(\chi) = 1, \, h(\chi) = \sqrt{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|^\upsilon} \), with \(\upsilon = 1,2\). Here, \(\chi = |E| / E_p\), \(\tilde{\beta} = \beta / E_p\), and \(\beta\) is the rainbow parameter. We found that while the pairs \((f,h)\) in the first and third cases fully comply with the theory of rainbow gravity and ensure that \(E_p\) is the maximum possible energy for particles and antiparticles, the second pair does not show any response to the effects of rainbow gravity. We show that the corresponding bosonic states can form magnetized, spinning vortices in monolayer materials, and these vortices can be driven by adjusting an out-of-plane aligned magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Effective loop cosmology is a mere symplectic modification of standard cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that several prescriptions for the effective continuum limit of the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker loop quantum cosmology can be understood as the exact classical limit of the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of certain dynamical systems -- which are themeselves symplectic modifications of the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model. It is also demonstrated that a similar situation holds for two highly relevant anisotropic models. The required symplectic modifications are explicitly constructed. It is argued that this state of affairs makes the case for the associated Wheeler-DeWitt framework to be considered as an alternate quantum cosmology paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of late time universe in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct cosmological model in nonmetricity scalar functional gravitational Lagrangian $f(Q)$ which describes the dynamical evolution of the late accelerating universe. Cosmological models are constructed considering different functional of $f(Q)$ gravity where $Q$ in the gravitational action. We obtain cosmological model probing late universe with a constant jerk parameter. The observational constraints that are imposed on the model parameters for a realistic scenario estimated using the observational Hubble data and the Pantheon dataset. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, energy density and the equation of state (EoS) parameter are also explored. The transition of the universe from a deceleration to an accelerating phase is investigated in different framework of $f(Q)$ theories. We also analyzed the variation of the effective EoS parameter and found that the matter content in the universe favours quintessence type fluid in all the $f(Q)$-gravity. The energy conditions for a realistic scenario are examined and noted that the effective fluid violates the strong energy condition.</description>

      <title>Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of gravitational wave dynamics in $f(R,G)$ modified gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $G$ the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two auxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and backreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. The linearized field equations reveal how the Gauss-Bonnet term introduces new curvature-dependent couplings between tensor and scalar degrees of freedom, leading to modified dispersion relations and distinctive wave propagation effects. On de Sitter backgrounds, we obtain exact decoupled equations for the tensor and scalar modes, demonstrating how the additional $G$-dependence alters both the effective masses and energy transport mechanisms compared to pure $f(R)$ theories.
  Our derivation of the effective energy-momentum tensor extends Isaacson's approach to incorporate the novel scalar field contributions, revealing a complex hierarchy of characteristic length scales ($\lambda$, $\ell$, and $\mathcal{L}$) that govern the backreaction dynamics. The resulting formalism suggests potentially observable signatures in both the propagation (phase shifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves. These effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new constraints on the $f(R,G)$ coupling parameters. The theoretical framework developed here provides a foundation for future studies of gravitational wave generation in modified gravity scenarios and their role in cosmological structure formation.</description>

Abstract: We describe an exact solution representing a bouncing cosmology in the Minimal Exponential Measure (MEMe) model. Such a solution, obtained by means of the linearization around small values of the characteristic energy scale q of the theory, has the peculiarity of representing a complete bounce model that can be used to explore quantitative processes in non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Eccentric or circular? A reanalysis of binary black hole gravitational wave events for orbital eccentricity signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reanalysis of 17 gravitational-wave events detected with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in their first three observing runs, using the new IMRPhenomTEHM model -- a phenomenological time-domain multipolar waveform model for aligned-spin black-hole binaries in elliptical orbits with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and mean anomaly. We also analyze all events with the underlying quasi-circular model IMRPhenomTHM to study the impact of including eccentricity and compare the eccentric and quasi-circular binary hypotheses. The high computational efficiency of IMRPhenomTEHM enables us to explore the impact of two different eccentricity priors -- uniform and log-uniform -- as well as different sampler and data settings. We find evidence for eccentricity in two publicly available LVK events, GW200129 and GW200208_22, with Bayes factors favoring the eccentric hypothesis over the quasi-circular aligned-spin scenario: $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{E/QC}}\in\left[1.30^{+0.15}_{-0.15}, 5.14^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\right]$ and $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{E/QC}}\in\left[0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.08}, 1.14^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\right]$, respectively. Additionally, the two high-mass events GW190701 and GW190929 exhibit potential eccentric features. For all four events, we conduct further analyses to study the impact of different sampler settings. We also investigate waveform systematics by exploring the support for spin precession using IMRPhenomTPHM and NRSur7dq4, offering new insights into the formation channels of detected binaries. Our results highlight the importance of considering eccentric waveform models in future observing runs, alongside precessing models, as they can help mitigate potential biases in parameter estimation studies. This will be particularly relevant with the expected increase in the diversity of the binary black hole population with new detectors.</description>

      <title>The accretion disk and neutrino pair annihilation process of Barrow-modified Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attempts to clarify the deep consequences of Barrow fractal black hole spacetime configurations caused by quantum gravity on neutrino pair annihilation and accretion disk dynamics. We systematically derive the analytical expression for the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius ($r_{\text{ISCO}}\propto M^{2/(2+\Delta)}$) by building a Barrow-modified static spherically symmetric metric ($r\rightarrow r^{1+\Delta/2}$), and we find that increasing $\Delta$ significantly shifts the ISCO inward. We numerically solve the radiation flux, effective temperature, and differential luminosity distribution under the modified metric based on the Novikov-Thorne relativistic thin accretion disk model. For $\Delta=1$, the results show that the temperature increases by $62.5\%$, the peak disk radiation flux increases by $22.5\%$, and the spectral radiance increases by around $50\%$. Fractal horizons enhance neutrino trajectory bending effects, according to further study of neutrino pair annihilation ($\nu\bar{\nu}\rightarrow e^+e^-$) energy deposition processes using local Lorentz transformations and null geodesic equations. The energy deposition rate for $\Delta=1$ is $8-28$ times higher than classical estimates when the black hole radius is $R/M\sim3-4$. This work provides important theoretical insights into the influence of quantum spacetime geometry on high-energy astrophysical phenomena in extreme gravitational fields by establishing, for the first time, quantitative relationships between the Barrow parameter $\Delta$ and neutrino pair annihilation energy and accretion disk radiative efficiency.</description>

      <title>Consistency between Bulk and Boundary Causalities in Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. As an application, we show that in Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m--anti de Sitter spacetime, no geodesic satisfies the sufficient conditions for time advance even in the super-extremal case. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electrodynamic nature of spacetime collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>

      <title>RGUP Corrections to Scalar and Fermionic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP) effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation. Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are derived in Minkowski spacetime, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections that ensure a minimal observable length and revert to standard dynamics when corrections are absent. For fermionic fields in curved spacetime, spin connections maintain gravitational consistency. This framework, applicable to high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates quantum gravity into relativistic field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>Discovering $\mu$Hz gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter with binary resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a weak gravitational wave (GW) background, astrophysical binary systems act as high-quality resonators, with efficient transfer of energy and momentum between the orbit and a harmonic GW leading to potentially detectable orbital perturbations. In this work, we develop and apply a novel modeling and analysis framework that describes the imprints of GWs on binary systems in a fully time-resolved manner to study the sensitivity of lunar laser ranging, satellite laser ranging, and pulsar timing to both resonant and nonresonant GW backgrounds. We demonstrate that optimal data collection, modeling, and analysis lead to projected sensitivities which are orders of magnitude better than previously appreciated possible, opening up a new possibility for probing the physics-rich but notoriously challenging to access $\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency GWs. We also discuss improved prospects for the detection of the stochastic fluctuations of ultra-light dark matter, which may analogously perturb the binary orbits.</description>

      <title>Canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime in a cavity surrounded by a heat reservoir through the Euclidean path integral formalism. The heat reservoir is described by the boundary of the cavity with fixed radius $R$, fixed temperature $T$, and fixed electric charge $Q$. We use York's approach to find the reduced action, and then perform a zero loop approximation. We find that the number of solutions for the black hole depends on the electric charge being smaller or larger than a critical $Q_s$, having two stable and one unstable solutions for the former case, and one stable solution for the latter. We obtain the system's thermodynamic properties from the partition function. We analyze thermodynamic stability, controlled by the positivity of the heat capacity at constant area and electric charge. We show that there is a discontinuity in the heat capacity, signaling a turning point. We investigate the favorable stable phases and the phase diagram of the system. We show that the two stable black hole solutions can suffer a first order phase transition from one to the other, and at the critical charge $Q_s$ this turns into a second order one. We introduce a model of charged hot flat space, i.e., hot flat space with charge near the boundary. We find that a first order phase transition between the large stable black hole and charged hot flat space occurs at a horizon radius larger than the Buchdahl bound, and comment on the physics. Finally, we recover the Davies thermodynamic solutions and a Rindler solution in the limit of infinite cavity, and the York solutions in the limit of zero charge. Hence, both York and Davies formalisms are unified and connected in our approach. In all instances we mention carefully the four-dimensional case, for which we accomplish new results, and study in detail all aspects of the five-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Magnetic recoil interferometer in a uniform gravitational field. Comment on Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer looks different for different coordinate choices or the addition of a uniform gravitational field, but the final result of the observable phase shift does not depend on the coordinate choices or the uniform gravitational field. We find that the phase shift observed in ``Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves'' is a magnetic recoil phase shift, similar to the recoil phase shift in light-pulse interferometers. Recoil phase shifts are inversely proportional to the inertial mass and do not depend on the gravitational mass. Our analysis highlights the difference between magnetic and gravitational acceleration in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Signatures of Bulk Comptonization from within the Plunging Region of Accreting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering by the thermal motions of electrons is believed to produce polarized hard X-rays in active galactic nuclei and black-hole binaries. Meanwhile, plasma within the plunging region of the black hole free falls into the event horizon with a bulk relativistic speed, which could also imprint polarization on up-scattered photons but has not been discussed in detail. To examine this, we computed polarimetric signatures via general relativistic ray-tracing of a toy model consisting of an accreting, geometrically thin plasma with moderate optical depth, falling onto the black hole with a bulk relativistic speed within the plunging region. We show that the maximum spatially unresolved linear polarization could be as large as approximately $7 - 8$ percent when the black hole is viewed near edge-on, while the corresponding resolved linear polarization could be roughly $50$ percent. The large discrepancy between the two is due to 1) dilution from the radiation outside the plunging region and 2) substantial cancellations of the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ fluxes. The resultant polarization contributed by bulk Comptonization could nevertheless exceed that of thermal electron scattering in a Novikov-Thorne disk. Our results thus suggest a new model for imprinting considerable polarization on the electromagnetic observables of accreting black holes. Measurements of X-ray polarization from black-hole binaries and the central black hole of active galactic nuclei could provide direct detection of the plunging region and help constrain plasma properties in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Plasma Angular Momentum on Magnetically Arrested Flows and Relativistic Jets in Hot Accretion Flows Around Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain scenarios, the accreted angular momentum of plasma onto a black hole could be low; however, how the accretion dynamics depend on the angular momentum content of the plasma is still not fully understood. We present three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows around rapidly spinning black holes (with spin $a = +0.9$). The initial condition is a Fishbone-Moncrief (FM) torus threaded by a large amount of poloidal magnetic flux, where the angular velocity is a fraction $f$ of the standard value. For $f = 0$, the accretion flow becomes magnetically arrested and launches relativistic jets but only for a very short duration. After that, free-falling plasma breaks through the magnetic barrier, loading the jet with mass and destroying the jet-disk structure. Meanwhile, magnetic flux is lost via giant, asymmetrical magnetic bubbles that float away from the black hole. The accretion then exits the magnetically arrested state. For $f = 0.1$, the dimensionless magnetic flux threading the black hole oscillates quasi-periodically. The jet-disk structure shows concurrent revival and destruction while the gas outflow efficiency at the event horizon changes accordingly. For $f \geq 0.3$, we find that the dynamical behavior of the system starts to approach that of a standard accreting FM torus. Our results thus suggest that the accreted angular momentum is an important parameter that governs the maintenance of a magnetically arrested flow and launching of relativistic jets around black holes.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logarithmic corrections to the entropy of extremal black holes have proven effective in precisely matching the microscopic degeneracies obtained from string-theoretic as well as a non-perturbative quantum correction manifests as an exponential term in the black hole entropy. In this work, we extend the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco by deriving a generalized form where entropy is not just the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our analysis treats entropy as a general function of the horizon radius, and with the help of that, we formulate the generalized universal relation. We show that, in the case of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the generalized relation coincides with the original universal relation by Goon and Penco. Furthermore, we explore the implications of logarithmic and exponential corrections to entropy and test the validity of the generalized universal relation under these modifications.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>

      <title>Fast Higher-Order Interpolation and Restriction in ExaHyPE Avoiding Non-physical Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict along resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla code version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a stationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved quantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order interpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid cell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster than the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary black hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR boundaries are removed.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

Abstract: We study massless solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to different matter models with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity assuming spatial homogeneity with three commuting spatial translations. We show that there are no solutions in the case that the matter model is a radiation fluid. If the matter is described via kinetic theory we obtain that there exist unique solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system and the Einstein-Boltzmann system for a certain range of soft potentials. For both the Vlasov and the Boltzmann case we also obtain asymptotic expansions close to the initial conformal gauge singularity.</description>

      <title>On relativistic dynamical tides: subtleties and calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of astrophysical compact objects to external tidal fields carries valuable information on the nature of these objects, on the equation of state of matter, and on the underlying gravitational theory. In this work, we highlight subtleties in describing relativistic dynamical tidal responses that arise from ambiguities in the decomposition of a perturbed metric into external tidal and induced response pieces. Observables are unambiguous. However in practice, differences arising from implicit assumptions in the definition of tidal deformabilities may lead to a bias in constraining nuclear physics or gravitational theories, if not properly tied to observational data. We propose calibration of a tidal response function for any compact objects in vacuum General Relativity. Within this framework, the dynamical tidal Love numbers of a Schwarzschild black hole in both even and odd sectors vanish at any multipole order. The calibration allows one to define dynamical tidal deformabilities of relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, as the difference from the BH values (zero) under the unified definition in a simple manner. As a straightforward extension of our framework, we compute the next-to-leading dissipative tidal response of Schwarzschild black holes for the first time.</description>

      <title>Tidal response beyond vacuum General Relativity with a canonical definition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal effects on compact objects provide profound theoretical insights into the structure of the field equations, and are wonderful probes of the equation of state of matter, the nature of black holes and of the underlying theory of gravity. The natural framework for understanding tides is a perturbative scheme. Here, we point out ambiguities in determining tidal response functions within such a framework, which may lead to bias in constraining physical parameters with gravitational-wave observations if the computed quantities are not properly linked to observables. We propose a Canonical Tidal Response Function (CTRF) definition to compare values of tides in theories beyond vacuum General Relativity in a unified manner. As an example, we provide black hole tidal response functions, including both conservative and dissipative pieces, in various theories of gravity. Tidal dissipation Love numbers for black holes are derived here for the first time in most of the non-Einsteinian theories considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Shadows and parameter estimation of rotating quantum corrected black holes and constraints from EHT observation of M87* and Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09198v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of quantum gravity (QG) inspired rotating black holes limits the progress of testing QG through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The EHT imaged the supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87*, revealing an angular shadow diameter of $d_{sh} = 48.7 \pm 7 \mu$as with a black hole mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$ for Sgr A*. For M87*, with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, the EHT measured an angular diameter of $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as. We present rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) spacetimes with an additional QC parameter $\alpha$ and constrain it by EHT observations. For angular shadow diameter ($d_{sh}$) of Sgr A* at $\theta_o = 50^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.443 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.8066 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.447 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.894 M)$. While for M87* at inclination $\theta_o = 17^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8511 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.6157 M)$ at $\alpha=0.8985 M^2$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8262 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.9799 M)$ at $\alpha=0.4141 M^2$. These results show that $\alpha$ significantly affects the shadows, offering key constraints on QG models. With EHT constraints from Sgr A and M87*, RQCBHs and Kerr black holes are indistinguishable in much of the EHT-constrained parameter space, making RQCBHs strong candidates for astrophysical black holes along with other BHs, e.g., regular black holes and other quantum-corrected solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the emission of gravitational waves in quadratic gravity theory is examined. The wave equations for massless and massive perturbations are derived, followed by the calculation of the energy and angular momentum radiated. In the quadrupole approximation, and taking into account only the transverse-traceless modes, it is shown that the theory avoids the issues generated by the Ostrogradsky instabilities and achieves positive energy and angular momentum emissions. As an example, a rotating ellipsoid with free precession is analyzed, and the effects of the massive perturbations on its rotation are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of shearfree gravitational collapse using cylindrically symmetric spacetimes whose interior is a non-rotating dissipative fluid bounded by a cylindrical hypersurface beyond which is an Einstein-Rosen vacuum exterior. We consider three different pressure configurations: axially, azimuthally, and radially directed, for which we find new exact interior solutions of the field equations. We show that the matching conditions cannot be satisfied by the fluid with radial pressure, while the axial and azimuthal cases with a lapse function depending only on the time coordinate do satisfy these constraints. We derive, for both cases, a sufficient condition for an emission of gravitational radiation from the interior towards the exterior. Therefore we show that, at variance with what happens for spherical symmetry, in the simplified picture of an infinite cylinder of anisotropic shearfree matter, gravitational waves can be emitted during collapsing motion.</description>

      <title>The neutrino flavor oscillations in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of neutrino lensing induced by a Damour-Solodukhin wormhole on the neutrino oscillation. We derive and calculate the flavour transition probabilities in the presence of Damour-Solodukhin factor $\Lambda$ as a shift in the massive source to show that the neutrino flavour oscillation is also sensitive not only to the sign of difference between the squared masses but also to the individual mass of neutrinos in both the two-flavour and the three-flavour cases, which is similar to the results for the black holes in the previous works mentioned here. As a consequence of parameter $\Lambda$ within a region, a series of curves of probability function versus the azimuthal angle $\phi$ with definite masses of neutrino can be plotted and their shapes resemble each other in the case of two-flavoured neutrinos and of three-flavoured ones. In view of the probability functions due to the wormhole, we reveal that the contribution of the factor $\Lambda$ is novel. Based on our analytical and numerical discussions on the probability expressions, the difference of the neutrino flavour oscillation arising from the shift in the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ is detectable. It is crucial that the $\Lambda$ as deviation from the black holes can change the shapes of the curves greatly, in the case of three-flavoured neutrinos in particular. The detailed comparisons can be made among our estimations depicted in the figures for neutrino oscillations and the measurements from the detector, which open a new window for judging whether the remote star as lens is black-hole-like wormhole or just a spherically symmetric black hole and further the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ can be estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>

Abstract: We show that Poincar\'e invariance directly implies the existence of a complexified Minkowski space whose real and imaginary directions unify spacetime and spin, which we dub spinspacetime. Despite the intrinsic noncommutativity of spin, spinspacetime exhibits mutually commuting holomorphic coordinates. Its twistorial construction derives the Newman-Janis shift property of spinning black holes by massive half-Fourier transforming complexified on-shell kinematics, which encode a spinning analog of equivalence principle.</description>

Abstract: We study the details of the explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the constrained 3BF action representing the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity. First we discuss how each particular constraint breaks the original symmetry of the topological 3BF action. Then we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory in the constrained 3BF form, in order to demonstrate that they can indeed be performed in the framework of higher gauge theory. A formulation of the Proca action as a constrained 3BF theory is also studied in detail.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress on the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics for black holes in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, we investiggate the hologrphic thermodynamics for the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Through the extended bulk thermodynamics for the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole, we derive the first law of the CFT thermodynamics which is obtained by directly translating the arbitrary conformal factors in the dual CFT. In addition to the newly defined chemical potential $\mu$ conjugating to the central charge $C$, we obtain other pairs of thermodynamics for the CFT, such as the temperature $\tilde{T}$ and the entropy $S$, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ and its conjugate variable $ \tilde{\mathcal{A}}$, the pressure $\mathcal{P}$ and its conjugate volume $\mathcal{V}$. In the fixed $C$, $\mathcal{V}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ canonical ensemble, we obtain the canonical description of the CFT thermodynamics and observe the standard swallowtail behavior in the Helmholtz free energy vs the temperature plot. The self-intersection point of the Helmholtz free energy indicates the phase transition between the high and low entropy states of the CFT. By using Maxwell's equal area law, we get the critical point and coexistence curve for the high and low entropy phases of the CFT. Besides, we get the critical exponents for the CFT, and find that the critical point and critical exponents associated with the $\tilde{T}-S$ criticality of the CFT are the same as those of the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>The 230 GHz Variability of Numerical Models of Sagittarius A* II. The Physical Origins of the Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our previous work, Chan et al. 2024, to investigate how variations in the electron temperature prescription parameter, $R_{\rm Low}$, influence the $3$-hour variability at $230$\,GHz, $M_{\Delta T}$, in magnetic-arrested disk (MAD) models of Sagittarius~A* (Sgr~A*), through analyzing a series of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and raytracing simulations. For models with a black hole spin $a &gt; 0$, we discovered that increasing $R_{\rm Low}$ renders the photon ring more optically thick, obscuring the varying accretion flows that contribute to the variability. However, as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, MAD flux eruptions become more pronounced, compensating for the decrease in $M_{\Delta T}$. For models with a spin $a &lt; 0$, although a higher $R_{\rm Low}$ also increases the optical thickness of the fluid, voids within the optically thick gas fail to cover the entire photon ring. Similarly, flux eruptions become more prominent as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, contributing to the observed rise in $M_{\Delta T}$ relative to $R_{\rm Low}$. For black holes with a spin $a = 0$, although the effect of increasing optical depth is still present, their $230$\,GHz light curves, and hence $M_{\Delta T}$, are insensitive to changes in $R_{\rm Low}$. Furthermore, we found that the variability of the $230$\,GHz light curves at $R_{\rm Low} = 1$ might correlate with fluctuations in the internal energy of the gas near the black hole, and we listed potential causes and solutions to the over-variability problem. Our findings highlight potential approaches for refining $M_{\Delta T}$ to better align with observations when modeling Sgr~A*.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler Equation from Effective Action: Implications for the Smarr Formula in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes a geometrical scale of the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of well-established physics. Finally, our findings raise important questions regarding the validity of treating the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a thermodynamic variable, as proposed in certain frameworks within the literature.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Kerr-AdS black hole from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the universal structure of the gravitational path integral beyond semi-classical saddles and uncovering a compelling statistical interpretation of black hole thermodynamics have long been significant challenges. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics through an ensemble-averaged theory. By extending the phase space to include all possible states with conical singularities in their Euclidean counterparts, we derive the probability distribution of different states inherited from the Euclidean gravitational path integral. Moreover, we can define a density matrix of all states in the phase space. By ensemble-averaging over all states, we show that the black hole phase transition naturally arises in the semi-classical limit. Away from the semi-classical regime, the ensemble-averaged theory exhibits a notable deviation from the conventional phase transition. Expanding around the classical saddles yields the subleading-order correction to the Gibbs free energy, which is half of the Hawking temperature. We demonstrate that the half Hawking temperature correction is a universal feature inherent to black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime. With the subleading-order correction to Gibbs free energy, we also suggest that the whole black hole thermodynamic should be corrected accordingly.</description>

      <title>Perihelion precession in non-Newtonian central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>
