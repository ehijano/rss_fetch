      <title>Towards Self-cognitive Exploration: Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguage Models by leveraging structured knowledge. However, existing KG-RAG frameworks typically operate as open-loop systems, suffering from cognitive blindness, an inability to recognize their exploration deficiencies. This leads to relevance drift and incomplete evidence, which existing self-refinement methods, designed for unstructured text-based RAG, cannot effectively resolve due to the path-dependent nature of graph exploration. To address this challenge, we propose Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (MetaKGRAG), a novel framework inspired by the human metacognition process, which introduces a Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust cycle to enable path-aware, closed-loop refinement. This cycle empowers the system to self-assess exploration quality, identify deficiencies in coverage or relevance, and perform trajectory-connected corrections from precise pivot points. Extensive experiments across five datasets in the medical, legal, and commonsense reasoning domains demonstrate that MetaKGRAG consistently outperforms strong KG-RAG and self-refinement baselines. Our results validate the superiority of our approach and highlight the critical need for path-aware refinement in structured knowledge retrieval.</description>

      <title>Improving Dense Passage Retrieval with Multiple Positive Passages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging a dual encoder architecture, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) has outperformed traditional sparse retrieval algorithms such as BM25 in terms of passage retrieval accuracy. Recently proposed methods have further enhanced DPR's performance. However, these models typically pair each question with only one positive passage during training, and the effect of associating multiple positive passages has not been examined. In this paper, we explore the performance of DPR when additional positive passages are incorporated during training. Experimental results show that equipping each question with multiple positive passages consistently improves retrieval accuracy, even when using a significantly smaller batch size, which enables training on a single GPU.</description>

      <title>TFRank: Think-Free Reasoning Enables Practical Pointwise LLM Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning-intensive ranking models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress, but existing approaches often rely on large-scale LLMs and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, resulting in high computational cost and latency that limit real-world use. To address this, we propose \textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data, fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree" reasoning capability by employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints. Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank (e.g., 1.7B) achieves performance comparable to models with four times more parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark, and demonstrates strong competitiveness on the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems. Our code and data are released in the repository: https://github.com/JOHNNY-fans/TFRank.</description>

      <title>Personalized Product Search Ranking: A Multi-Task Learning Approach with Tabular and Non-Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data, leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2, and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels. Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search ranking.</description>

      <title>On Negative-aware Preference Optimization for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems leverage user interaction data to suggest relevant items while filtering out irrelevant (negative) ones. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention for their potential in recommendation tasks. However, existing methods for optimizing LLM-based recommenders face challenges in effectively utilizing negative samples. Simply integrating large numbers of negative samples can improve ranking accuracy and mitigate popularity bias but often leads to increased computational overhead and memory costs. Additionally, current approaches fail to account for the varying informativeness of negative samples, leading to suboptimal optimization performance. To address these issues, we propose NAPO (\textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization), an enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation. NAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which expands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and (2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the confidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and popularity bias reduction.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment Model for Long Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation enable richer item understanding, while modeling users' multi-scale interests across temporal horizons has attracted growing attention. However, effectively exploiting multimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to substantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation remain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal Fusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential recommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal Fusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and is trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i) cross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for recommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and preventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional regularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item representations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse Attention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences via a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed attention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user interests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models both the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block variations, producing robust user and item representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks show that MUFASA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, online A/B tests demonstrate significant gains in production, confirming MUFASA's effectiveness in leveraging multimodal cues and accurately capturing diverse user preferences.</description>

      <title>Describe What You See with Multimodal Large Language Models to Enhance Video Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders. These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple, recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to build more intent-aware video recommenders.</description>

      <title>Multimodal RAG Enhanced Visual Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</description>

      <title>ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency, particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably, on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential approaches.</description>

      <title>RicciFlowRec: A Geometric Root Cause Recommender Using Ricci Curvature on Financial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary results on S\&amp;P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial decision support.</description>

      <title>A Signer-Invariant Conformer and Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

      <title>On the Consistency and Performance of the Iterative Bayesian Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many social, scientific, and commercial purposes, it is often important to estimate the distribution of the users' data regarding a sensitive attribute, e.g., their ages, locations, etc. To allow this estimation while protecting the users' privacy, every user applies a local privacy protection mechanism that releases a noisy (sanitized) version of their original datum to the data collector; then the original distribution is estimated using one of the known methods, such as the matrix inversion (INV), RAPPOR's estimator, and the iterative Bayesian update (IBU). Unlike the other estimators, the consistency of IBU, i.e., the convergence of its estimate to the real distribution as the amount of noisy data grows, has been either ignored or incorrectly proved in the literature. In this article, we use the fact that IBU is a maximum likelihood estimator to prove that IBU is consistent. We also show, through experiments on real datasets, that IBU significantly outperforms the other methods when the users' data are sanitized by geometric, Laplace, and exponential mechanisms, whereas it is comparable to the other methods in the case of the k-RR and RAPPOR mechanisms. Finally, we consider the case when the alphabet of the sensitive data is infinite, and we show a technique that allows IBU to operate in this case too.</description>

      <title>SymCERE: Symmetric Contrastive Learning for Robust Review-Enhanced Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern recommendation systems can achieve high performance by fusing user behavior graphs (via GNNs) and review texts (via LLMs). However, this fusion faces three significant issues: (1) False Negatives in contrastive learning can degrade the training signal by penalizing similar items; (2) Popularity Bias, often encoded as embedding magnitude, can distort similarity scores; and (3) Signal Ambiguity, which arises from the conflation of objective facts with subjective sentiment in reviews. These interconnected issues can prevent models from learning users' true preferences. In this paper, we propose SymCERE (Symmetric SINCERE), a contrastive learning method that addresses these three issues simultaneously through its structural design. First, we introduce a symmetric application of the SINCERE loss for cross-modal alignment, which is designed to eliminate false negatives in recommendation. Second, by integrating this with L2 normalisation under a "magnitude-as-noise" hypothesis, we aim to mitigate popularity bias by forcing the model to encode preferences primarily in the vector's direction. Experiments on 15 datasets from three distinct platforms (e-commerce, local reviews, and travel) demonstrate that SymCERE outperforms several strong baselines, achieving a relative improvement of up to 43.6% on NDCG@10. Furthermore, a detailed LIME analysis shows that the model learns to anchor alignment on objective, informative vocabulary (e.g., "OEM," "compatible," "gasket"), while placing less emphasis on generic sentiment (e.g., "good," "great"). This suggests that effective semantic alignment stems from understanding factual product attributes, offering a path toward more accurate recommendation systems. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReviewGNN-2E1E.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model Acceleration and Optimization Strategies for Real-Time Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11421</link>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.</description>

      <title>WebArXiv: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Time-Invariant arXiv Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.</description>

      <title>VoteGCL: Enhancing Graph-based Recommendations with Majority-Voting LLM-Rerank Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Request-Only Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations (TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure (i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture (i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals, such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly architectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multimodal Streaming Recommendation via Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS. Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1) Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy, mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space. This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference, revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and practical value of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>ChineseHarm-Bench: A Chinese Harmful Content Detection Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability of property graph analysis.</description>
