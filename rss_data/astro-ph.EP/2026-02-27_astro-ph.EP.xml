      <title>JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Sub-Neptune HD 15337 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 3-5 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c (TOI-402.02), a sub-Neptune (2.526 R$_{\oplus}$, 6.792 M$_{\oplus}$, T$_{\rm eq}$$\sim$656 K) around a K1V star observed as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We reduce these observations with two pipelines and find consistent transmission spectra. The resulting median precisions in 30 pixel spectroscopic bins for visit 1 are $\sim$40 ppm and $\sim$70 ppm and for visit 2 are $\sim$30 ppm and $\sim$54 ppm for NRS1 and NRS2, respectively. We attribute the differing precisions to the lack of adequate pre-transit baseline in visit 1 from an early transit arrival caused by previously undetected transit timing variations (TTVs), hinting at a potential exterior companion. Our median JWST timing precision is 10 seconds, revealing TTVs $&gt;$20 minutes when combined with previous TESS and CHEOPS data, highlighting JWST's TTV measurement capabilities. The transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c is featureless and can best be described by a step function with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, likely caused by instrumental systematics. From thermochemical equilibrium retrievals we find that, to $&gt;$3$\sigma$, the data can rule out atmospheres with metallicities $&lt;$600 or $&lt;$310 $\times$ solar, depending on the reduction, for opaque pressures greater than a few millibars. HD 15337 c joins other sub-Neptunes with similar masses, radii, and temperatures in possessing a featureless transmission spectrum indicative of high metallicity and/or high-altitude aerosols and adds support to recent studies showing that aerosol opacity reaches a maximum for planets with equilibrium temperatures of 500-700 K.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: A NIRSpec G395H Transmission Spectrum of Radius Valley-Dweller TOI-260 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of TOI-260 b, a $T_\mathrm{eq}\sim 490$ K, $R_\mathrm{p} = 1.76\,R_\oplus$ planet. The transmission spectrum is derived by combining two transit observations, collected as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We achieved the same median transit depth precision of 37 ppm in both visits, and a median precision of 26 ppm when combining the spectroscopic light curves from the two visits. Implementing a 30-pixel-wide ($R\sim 200$) spectroscopic binning scheme, we find that the transmission spectrum is mostly featureless, with a possible feature around 3.17 $\mu$m. We assess the significance of any features in the transmission spectrum with a suite of non-parametric models, which confirm the presence of a potential feature in the NRS1 bandpass and an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors. To investigate the atmospheric composition of TOI-260 b, we run a series of PLATON retrievals. We do not detect any clear molecular signatures, but the combined data from the two visits are sufficient to constrain the atmospheric metallicity to greater than $200\times$ solar, assuming no opaque deck $\lesssim2.5$ mbar. We also investigate causes of the potential feature near 3.17 $\mu$m; while we find some compatible gaseous species and cannot fully discard an astrophysical origin, we suspect a systematics origin due to the variance in strength and position of the feature. Overall, this look at TOI-260 b adds to the small sample of radius-valley planets, which already seem to show a diversity in their atmospheric compositions. Determining the true nature of these enigmatic planets will require a larger telescope time investment.</description>

      <title>PICASO 4.0: Clouds and Photochemistry in Climate Models of Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a major update to the open-source atmospheric modeling package \texttt{PICASO}, designed for simulating the thermal structure and spectra of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This release, \texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-3237: Another Free-Floating Planet Candidate with Angular Einstein Radius Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation theories suggest the presence of free-floating planets (FFPs) that are ejected from their formation sites. While these planets emit very little light, they can be identified through gravitational microlensing. Here, we report the discovery of a FFP candidate in the microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-3237. The observed light curve exhibits strong finite-source effects characterized by a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.9\,{\rm mag})$ and a short timescale $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$. The analysis yields an Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} = 0.54\pm0.02\,{\rm days}$ and an angular Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E} = 6.30\pm0.48\,\mu{\rm as}$. The measurements make it possible to estimate the lens mass as $M \simeq 102\,M_{\oplus}\,(\pi_{\rm rel}/16\,\mu{\rm as})^{-1}$, where $\pi_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. Depending on the unknown $\pi_{\rm rel}$, the lens could be a Neptune-mass planet $(\pi_{\rm rel} \simeq 0.1\,{\rm mas})$ or a Saturn-mass planet $(\pi_{\rm rel} \simeq 16\,\mu{\rm as})$. A Bayesian analysis yields the lens mass $M = {67.3}_{-42.5}^{+103.2}\,M_{\oplus}$ and the lens distance $D_{\rm L} = {7.34}_{-2.11}^{+0.96}\,{\rm kpc}$. This lens is the eleventh isolated microlens with a measurement of $\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 10\,\mu{\rm as}$. We find that additional searches for possible signatures of a lens host do not show significant evidence for the host.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 supervised classification of asteroid reflectance spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a supervised, probabilistic taxonomic classification of asteroid reflectance spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). Using high-quality Gaia DR3 spectra and a reference set of spectra from the literature consisting exclusively of asteroids with robust spectroscopic taxonomic types, we construct a principal-component (PC) representation of the Gaia reflectances. For each major spectral complex (C, S, X) and several end-member classes (B, D, A, L, K, V), we model the distribution of reference objects in PC space using multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE). This yields likelihoods for each spectral class and provides a quantitative measure of classification confidence.
  Validation against a sample of objects with known spectral classes demonstrates good performance for classes with distinctive reflectance signatures, including the S-complex, D, V, and A types. Spectrally continuous classes (B-C-complex, K-L-S-complex, and X-complex) show the expected degrees of mixing given the limited wavelength range of Gaia's spectrophotometry. We further explore the compositional structure of six major asteroid collisional families using our Gaia-derived spectral classes, finding excellent agreement with ground-based spectroscopy and revealing enhanced detections of olivine-rich A type material in the Flora and Eunomia families, as well as new insights into the spectral diversity of the Tirela family.
  The resulting catalogue constitutes a fully probabilistic taxonomic classification for the full Gaia DR3 asteroid sample. It offers a resource for studying the compositional structure of the main belt, identifying family interlopers, and linking asteroid populations to meteorite groups, and establishes a methodological framework for future Gaia releases, in particular for the validation of the Gaia DR4, expected by the end of 2026.</description>

      <title>Probing the Atmospheres of Young Long-Period Sub-Neptune Progenitors with ELT/ANDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting and characterizing exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. While it has been highly successful for ultra-hot Jupiters and hot Jupiters, next-generation facilities such as ELT/ANDES will extend its reach to smaller and longer-period planets, including young sub-Neptunes and their progenitors. We investigate whether HRCCS with ELT/ANDES can robustly recover orbital parameters and atmospheric signals of the long-period sub-Neptunes V1298Taub and TOI-451c. For such systems, the slow Doppler drift of the planetary signal over a single night reduces its separation from stationary telluric contamination, increasing the risk of signal removal while detrending. We therefore quantify the impact of including out-of-transit exposures on signal recovery and parameter estimation. We simulate transmission observations in the YJH bands using the Ratri pipeline and analyze them with the HRCCS framework Upamana. For V1298Taub, we inject atmospheric signals consistent with HST, Spitzer, and JWST constraints. For TOI-451c, we explore models spanning sub-solar to super-solar C/O ratios to assess compositional sensitivity. We find that incorporating out-of-transit exposures significantly enhances detectability, provided that the detrending effects are consistently propagated to the template models prior to cross-correlation. Without this reprocessing step, recovered orbital parameters can deviate substantially from injected values or yield reduced detection significance. For V1298Tau b, &gt;5$\sigma$ detections of H2O, H2S, and CO are achievable within $\lesssim$10 hours (~2 nights). For TOI-451c, distinguishing sub-solar from super-solar C/O ratios requires $\geq$18 hours. HRCCS with ELT/ANDES will therefore be a key tool for probing the atmospheric diversity of young, long-period sub-Neptunes in the ELT era.</description>

      <title>Warm Debris Disk Candidates around Nearby FGK Stars from LAMOST DR12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm debris disks around main-sequence stars trace late-stage terrestrial planet formation. Motivated by the need for systematic searches of such systems, we identify debris disk candidates around FGK stars within 150 pc by combining a spectroscopically selected sample from LAMOST DR12 with Gaia astrometry and multi-band infrared photometry. Infrared excesses are identified through SED fitting and validated using conservative, source-by-source checks. This approach yields a final sample of 12 debris disk candidates including ten new detections. Stellar age research indicate that most of the host stars are several billion years old. NEOWISE monitoring reveals no significant W1/W2 variability, consistent with a circumstellar origin of the infrared excess. while a search for co-moving companions using Gaia DR3 reveals possible companions for only two candidates at very large projected separations ($\gtrsim 10^4$~au). Three candidates exhibit excess emission in both the W3 and W4 bands, allowing estimates of characteristic dust properties. This work establishes a small yet reliable sample of debris disk candidates anchored in homogeneous LAMOST spectroscopy, providing a foundation for future studies of debris disk evolution and stellar activity.</description>

      <title>TEPCat: The Transiting Extrasolar Planet Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transiting extrasolar planets are extraordinarily valuable for understanding the characteristics and formation of planets, because they are the only exoplanets whose physical and orbital properties can be measured to high precision. Thousands are now known, and it is important to maintain a database of them for use by the scientific community. TEPCat performs this task: it is a critical compilation of the physical and observable properties of the known transiting planetary systems. This work introduces the motivation for TEPCat, its scope, contents, and implementation. Example plots of interesting quantities are constructed. The classification of planets and of the eclipse features in their light curves is discussed. TEPCat is maintained and freely available online at https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/</description>

      <title>Elevated Eccentricities in the Radius Valley Hint at Water-Rich Mini-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent planet-formation models broadly reproduce the observed population of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, as well as the bimodal radius distribution (the ``radius valley''), it remains unclear whether all these planets share a common rocky composition (a single popoulation of planets) or instead comprise two distinct populations -- rocky planets and icy planets (two populations of planets). The inferred eccentricity-radius relation, which shows a modest peak near the radius valley, provides a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between these scenarios. Here we use N-body simulations to examine how the radii and eccentricities of close-in planets depend on the masses and orbital configurations of their progenitor protoplanets. We find that final planetary eccentricities scale with the system initial Safronov number. In two-population systems, energy equipartition between rocky and relatively more massive icy protoplanets creates a strong eccentricity contrast between the two groups, which appears as a peak near the radius valley. This signature does not appear if planetary systems are composed exclusively of rocky planets (with or without H-rich atmospheres), as assumed in photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Because the eccentricity-radius relation traces a dichotomy in the underlying protoplanet mass distribution -- most plausibly arising from formation at different disk locations -- our results suggest that a significant fraction of mini-Neptunes are water-worlds. The observed radius and eccentricity distributions may reflect a mixture of systems that host exclusively rocky planets, systems dominated by icy planets, and systems with both rocky and icy planets.</description>

      <title>TESS Planet Occurrence Rates Reveal the Disappearance of the Radius Valley Around Mid-to-Late M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the deepest systematic search for planets around mid-to-late M dwarfs to date. We have surveyed 8134 mid-to-late M dwarfs observed by TESS with a custom built pipeline and recover 77 vetted transiting planet candidates. We characterize the sensitivity of our survey via injection-recovery and measure the occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period, instellation, and planet radius. We measure a cumulative occurrence rate of $1.10\pm0.16$ planets per star with radii $&gt;1\, R_\oplus$ orbiting within 30 days. This value is consistent with the cumulative occurrence rate around early M dwarfs, making M dwarfs collectively the most prolific hosts of small close-in planets. Unlike the bimodal Radius Valley exhibited by close-in planet population around FGK and early M dwarfs, we recover a unimodal planet radius distribution peaking at $1.25\pm0.05 \, R_\oplus$. We additionally find $0.954\pm0.147$ super-Earths and $0.148\pm0.045$ sub-Neptunes per star, with super-Earths outnumbering sub-Neptunes 5.5:1, firmly demonstrating that the Radius Valley disappears around the lowest mass stars. The dearth of sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs is consistent with predictions from water-rich pebble accretion models that predict a fading Radius Valley with decreasing stellar mass. Our results support the emerging idea that the sub-Neptune population around M dwarfs is composed of water-rich worlds. We find no hot Jupiters in our survey and set an upper limit of 0.012 hot Jupiters per mid-to-late M dwarf within 10 days.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Lifespan of Intelligent Technological Civilization in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore constraints on the emergence and longevity of technologically intelligent civilizations in our Galaxy, considering the Fermi paradox. We argue that under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations imposes limits on their lifespan. Our analysis suggests that if intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to $\lesssim 5\times10^3$ years under our most optimistic scenario. Considering electromagnetic communication, we note that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past $\sim 10^5$ years, making the lack of detected signals particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations. We emphasize that these results should be interpreted as upper bounds derived from the Fermi paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.</description>

      <title>JWST-DECO: Temporal Variations in the Mid-IR Silicate Features of Two T Tauri Discs Based on Spitzer and JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22615</link>

Abstract: Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.</description>

      <title>Detection of circumstellar disks around nearby young brown dwarf candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Eating planets makes you younger: The magnetic dynamo rejuvenation of GJ 504 by planetary engulfment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\rm \dot{J}$). We then compared $\rm \dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\rm \dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.</description>

      <title>Investigating potential benefits of future sub-L1 missions with STEREO-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first statistical study of geomagnetic storm forecasting using in situ data from the STEREO-A spacecraft as a sub-L1 monitor. Between November 2022 and June 2024, STEREO-A crossed the Sun-Earth line, covering longitudinal and radial separations of +/-15{\deg} from the Sun-Earth line and 0.01-0.06 au from Earth. This passage provides a unique opportunity to assess future sub-L1 mission concepts by ESA, such as HENON and SHIELD. We identify 32 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by both STEREO-A and L1 spacecraft. Eight of these 32 CME events are first detected at L1, indicating that radial spacecraft separations of up to ~0.05 au do not always yield lead time advantages. Furthermore, we find greater (smaller) gains in lead time when STEREO-A is east (west) of the Sun-Earth line. We develop a baseline methodology for the use of future sub-L1 in situ data to enable time-shifting and real-time modeling of the geomagnetic SYM-H index. This is run continuously over the entire time period, therefore modeling the geomagnetic response of all solar wind structures. Our methodology is empirically motivated and should be considered a first approach in addressing the use of sub-L1 data. Following this methodology, 26 of 47 observed geomagnetic storms are correctly identified from STEREO-A data. Intense events (82%, SYM-H&lt;-100 nT) are well detected, most of which are also associated with an identified CME event. Most SYM-H minima are predicted later (72%) and stronger (58%) than those observed due to biases introduced by our methodology.</description>

      <title>Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed. For these six systems, we measure the system-integrated polarization fraction and angle of linear polarization, providing quantitative constraints on their unresolved circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Exocometary physics: material release and tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.
  This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $\beta$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $\beta$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.</description>
