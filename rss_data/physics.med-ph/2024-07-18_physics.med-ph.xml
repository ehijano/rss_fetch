      <title>Concrete Shielding Requirements for PET Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to determine the protective concrete shielding thickness requirements in concrete walls of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) facilities. Consider the most commonly used PET radiotracer, the radioisotope F18, which emits two back-to-back 511 keV photons. Photon transmission measurements were carried out through an Israeli B30 strength ordinary concrete wall (3 meter high, 20 cm thick) using photons emitted from an F18 source into a cone having a 24 degree FWHM dose aperture angle. The source, positioned 3 meters from the wall, yielded a 0.64 m beam disk radius on the wall. Our measurement setup roughly simulates radiation emitted from a patient injected with F18. Dose rates were measured by an Atomtex Radiation Survey Meter, positioned at distances 0.05 to 3 meters from the far side of the wall. For a wide-beam, thick-shielding setup, there is a buildup effect, as photons having reduced energies may reach the detector from Compton scattering in the wall. In concrete, the Compton scattering cross section accounts for 99% of the total interaction cross section. The buildup factor B accounts for the increase of observed radiation transmission through shielding material due to scattered radiation. We measured a narrow-beam transmission coefficient T=3.0 +- 0.9 %, consistent with the theoretical value 2% calculated from NIST photon attenuation data without buildup. We measured a wide-beam transmission coefficient of 8.6 +- 1.8%; in good agreement with two available wide-beam Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We confirm by experiment, complementing MC simulations, that for a 20 cm thick concrete wall, due to buildup, about four times thicker shielding is required to achieve a designated level of radiation protection, compared to that calculated using narrow-beam, thin-shielding transmission coefficients.</description>

      <title>Biomechanical modeling of the human tongue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tongue is a crucial organ for performing basic biological functions, such as chewing, swallowing and phonation. Understanding how it behaves, its motor control and involvement in the execution of these different tasks is therefore an important issue for the management and therapeutic treatment of pathologies relating to these essential functions so that quality of life can be preserved. This chapter focuses on the biomechanical modeling of this organ, as one of the key steps towards this understanding. Such a modeling will be an important tool to predict and control the functional impact of lingual surgery in the field of computer-assisted medical interventions.</description>

      <title>Strategies for CT Reconstruction using Diffusion Posterior Sampling with a Nonlinear Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling(DPS) methodology is a novel framework that permits nonlinear CT reconstruction by integrating a diffusion prior and an analytic physical system model, allowing for one-time training for different applications. However, baseline DPS can struggle with large variability, hallucinations, and slow reconstruction. This work introduces a number of strategies designed to enhance the stability and efficiency of DPS CT reconstruction. Specifically, jumpstart sampling allows one to skip many reverse time steps, significantly reducing the reconstruction time as well as the sampling variability. Additionally, the likelihood update is modified to simplify the Jacobian computation and improve data consistency more efficiently. Finally, a hyperparameter sweep is conducted to investigate the effects of parameter tuning and to optimize the overall reconstruction performance. Simulation studies demonstrated that the proposed DPS technique achieves up to 46.72% PSNR and 51.50% SSIM enhancement in a low-mAs setting, and an over 31.43% variability reduction in a sparse-view setting. Moreover, reconstruction time is sped up from &gt;23.5 s/slice to &lt;1.5 s/slice. In a physical data study, the proposed DPS exhibits robustness on an anthropomorphic phantom reconstruction which does not strictly follow the prior distribution. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed DPS can accommodate various dose levels and number of views. With 10% dose, only a 5.60% and 4.84% reduction of PSNR and SSIM was observed for the proposed approach. Both simulation and phantom studies demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve reconstruction accuracy and reduce computational costs, greatly enhancing the practicality of DPS CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of human sex differences in ECG identified by automated torso-cardiac three-dimensional reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Aims: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI), though its interpretation is confounded by anatomical variability and sex differences. Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and poorer outcomes following infarction. Sex differences in ECG biomarkers and torso-ventricular anatomy have not been well characterised, largely due to the absence of high-throughput torso reconstruction methods.
  Methods: This work presents quantification of sex differences in ECG versus anatomical biomarkers in healthy and post-MI subjects, enabled by a novel, end-to-end automated pipeline for torso-ventricular anatomical reconstruction from clinically standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Personalised 3D torso-ventricular reconstructions were generated for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from the UK Biobank. Regression models were created relating the extracted torso-ventricular and ECG parameters.
  Results: Half the sex difference in QRS durations is explained by smaller ventricles in women both in healthy ($3.4 \pm 1.3$ms of $6.0 \pm 1.5$ms) and post-MI ($4.5 \pm 1.4$ms of $8.3 \pm 2.5$ms) subjects. Lower baseline STj amplitude in women is also associated with smaller ventricles, and more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are more strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women rather than electrophysiology as in men.
  Conclusion: A novel computational pipeline enables the three-dimensional reconstruction of 1476 torso-cardiac geometries of healthy and post-myocardial infarction subjects, quantification of sex and BMI-related differences and association with ECG biomarkers. Any ECG-based tool should be reviewed considering anatomical sex differences to avoid sex-biased outcomes.</description>

      <title>Objective rates as covariant derivatives on the manifold of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subject of so-called objective derivatives in Continuum Mechanics has along history and has generated varying views concerning their true mathematical interpretation. Several attempts have been made to provide a mathematical definition that would at least partially unify the existing notions.  In this paper, we demonstrate that, under natural assumptions, all objective derivatives correspond to covariant derivatives on the infinite-dimensional manifold Met(B) of Riemannian metrics on the body. Furthermore, a natural Leibniz rule enables canonical extensions from covariant to contravariant tensor fields and vice versa. This makes the sometimes-used distinction between objective derivatives of ``Lie type'' and ``corotational type'' unnecessary. For an exhaustive list of objective derivatives found in the literature, we exhibit the corresponding covariant derivative on Met(B).</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies are developed. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>
