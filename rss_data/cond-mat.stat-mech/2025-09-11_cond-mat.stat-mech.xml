      <title>Activity-driven clustering of jamming run-and-tumble particles: Exact three-body steady state by dynamical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles, reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes. A cascade of scales in the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor role. This approach lays the groundwork for tackling the $N$-body problem.</description>

      <title>A Unified Nonequilibrium Framework: Thermodynamic Distance, Dissipation, and Stationary Laws via Effective State Count, Variational Stationarity, and Thermodynamic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics built around the effective number of accessible state, a multiplicative count that ranges from for a uniform distribution to one under complete localization, and whose logarithm coincides with the Gibbs Shannon entropy. This gives a natural thermodynamic distance to equipartition that bounds statistical distinguishability and grows monotonically under doubly stochastic relaxation. The construction extends to arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states with a chosen reference distribution, where the Kullback Leibler divergence splits into an entropy deficit and a reference weight coupling, acts as a Lyapunov functional when the reference is fixed, and reduces to excess free energy in canonical settings. We connect these static notions to dynamics by decomposing entropy production into adiabatic (housekeeping) and nonadiabatic parts, identify the latter with the rate of decay of the divergence to the reference, and complement this with trajectory and activity-based potentials that yield fluctuation symmetries, thermodynamic uncertainty bounds, and activity-limited speed constraints on steady currents</description>

      <title>Noise-Activated Dopant Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Thermal Landscapes with Localized Cold Spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling dopant transport with high spatial precision is crucial for improving the semiconductor functionality, reliability, and scalability. Although prior models of noise-assisted diffusion have been largely confined to idealized one dimensional settings, we present a physically realistic two-dimensional theoretical framework that integrates anisotropic quartic confinement with localized thermal cold spots to direct impurity dynamics. Using a generalized Fokker Planck formalism, we show that the geometry of the thermal landscape, particularly the width and arrangement of cold spots, governs a noise induced transition between monostable and bistable effective potentials. This enables tunable noise activated hopping and supports conditions favorable for stochastic resonance (SR) if weak periodic driving is applied. Quantitative predictions are made for how impurity localization and effective barrier heights depend on the cold spot width and trap depth , offering experimentally testable signatures. We propose an experimental realization using optothermal techniques, such as dual beam optical tweezers and laser cooling, which can sculpt reconfigurable thermal profiles with sub micron resolution. This model establishes a versatile pathway for programmable impurity manipulation and noise sensitive control in semiconductor structures, bridging theoretical predictions with feasible experimental detection via photoluminescence mapping or lock in signal amplification.</description>

      <title>Compensation behaviour in trilayered anisotropic 6-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model has been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Open boundary conditions are applied in all directions. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, i.e., the vanishing of the total magnetisation even with nonvanishing sublattice magnetisation, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The finite size analysis has been done through the temperature dependence of fourth order Binder cumulant, and the scaling exponents are estimated.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Model of Random Walks with Stochastic Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve exactly the non-equilibrium dynamics of two discrete random walkers moving in channels with transition rates $p \neq q$ that swap positions at a rate $s$. We compute exactly the joint probability distribution $P_{n,m}(t)$ for the walkers, revealing the existence of two dynamical crossovers. The first signals the passage from independent diffusion to a swap-dominated regime where the particles act as identical random walkers swapping positions. The second crossover occurs when both channels become indistinguishable and the walkers move around the same position. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a persistent spatial anisotropy defined by the difference between the second moments of the probability distributions in the two channels. Our results may provide a quantitative framework to understand diverse systems. In biology, it is motivated by motor proteins (kinesin/dynein) exchanging cargo leadership, membrane receptors swapping binding partners, or brain synapses with activity-dependent plasticity. In finance, it models traders with distinct risk profiles swapping positions in limit-order books, or volatility spillover between coupled markets. These diverse systems share a unifying theme: exchange processes mediate macroscopic correlations despite individual heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking Phases in Steady States of Quantum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.</description>

      <title>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Anomalously fast transport in non-integrable lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.</description>

Abstract: The open XXZ spin chain with the anisotropy parameter $\Delta=-\frac12$, diagonal boundary fields that depend on a parameter $x$, and finite length $N$ is studied. In a natural normalisation, the components of its ground-state vector are polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients. It is shown that their sum is given by a generating function for the weighted enumeration of totally-symmetric alternating sign matrices with weights depending on $x$.</description>

      <title>Vortex triplets, symmetry breaking, and emergent nonequilibrium plastic crystals in an active-spinner fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of patterns and exotic nonequilibrium steady states in active-fluid systems continues to pose challenging problems -- theoretical, numerical, and experimental -- for statistical physicists and fluid dynamicists. We combine theoretical ideas from statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics to uncover a new type of self-assembled crystal of vortex triplets in an active-spinner fluid. We begin with the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active rotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi that distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) spinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the conventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced activity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We demonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and this system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with spinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium counterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical properties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations of this new state of active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that open quantum systems exhibiting dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) allow for highly efficient protocols implementing the Pontus-Mpemba effect. The relaxation speed-up toward a predesignated target state is tied to the existence of a long metastable time window preceding the DPT and can be exploited in applications to systematically optimize quantum protocols. As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for non-Markovian SIR and SIS models beyond mean field, utilizing the continuous-time random walk formalism. Using a gamma distribution for the infection and recovery inter-event times as a test case, we derive asymptotical late-time master equations with effective memory kernels and obtain analytical predictions for the final outbreak size distribution in the SIR model, and quasistationary distribution and disease lifetime in the SIS model. We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime. We also show that rescaled Markovian models fail to capture fluctuations in the non-Markovian case. Overall, our findings, confirmed against numerical simulations, demonstrate that memory strongly shapes epidemic dynamics and paves the way for extending such analyses to structured populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Kondo destruction quantum critical point: fixed point annihilation and thermodynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of strongly correlated electron systems exhibit strange metallicity, and they are increasingly recognized as in proximity to correlation-driven localization-delocalization transitions. A prototype setting arises in heavy fermion metals, where the proximity to the electron localization is manifested as Kondo destruction. Here we show that the Kondo destruction quantum critical point is linked to the phenomenon of fixed point annihilation. This connection reveals the absence of residual entropy density at the quantum critical point and, thus, its thermodynamic stability. Broader implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Work statistics of sudden Quantum quenches: A random matrix theory perspective on Gaussianity and its deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the form $W=\sum_{r\le m} a_r\,\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ (and in models with pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional $b_r\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\mathrm{Var}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_r r\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain. Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Interaction-free ergodicity-breaking driven by temporally hyperuniform noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that norm-conserving spin models driven by temporally hyperuniform noise exhibit a sharp ergodicity-breaking transition in the absence of interactions. In the nonergodic phase, the dynamics freeze into configurations determined by the initial condition. Our analysis demonstrates that such interaction-free ergodicity breaking arises generically whenever a global constraint is imposed and the driving noise is class-I hyperuniform, the strongest form in Torquato's classification. The transition can also be interpreted as a condensation of fluctuations into the zero-frequency mode, reminiscent of Bose--Einstein condensation in an ideal gas.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modes of active Potts models with factorizable numbers of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of $q$-state Potts models with $q=4$, $5$, $6$, and $8$ using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the $q$ homogeneous phases and $q$-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of $q$. However, for a factorizable $q$ value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For $q=6$, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Multiple crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Orientational dynamics governs the pathways of entropic crystallization of Brownian squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles having anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier. The translational and rotational dynamics of such particles become coupled at higher densities, resulting in complex kinetics of their configurational ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional entropic system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and their respective contributions toward minimizing the free energy, we show that the range of accessible orientational states of the particles principally governs the pathways of structural evolution, as the orientational entropy dictates the minimization of the free energy and, hence, the resulting optimal equilibrium ordering. When the particles have access to a wider range of orientational states, the larger rotational component of configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of the side-aligned particles with restricted rotational fluctuations maximize the entropy with a greater contribution from the translational component, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. We further show that density influences the crystallization pathways indirectly by setting an upper bound on the range of accessible orientational states. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations further corroborate our findings, and their generalizability is demonstrated using a system of triangular particles. Thus, orientational dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role in governing the pathways for entropic ordering of various anisotropic shapes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</description>
