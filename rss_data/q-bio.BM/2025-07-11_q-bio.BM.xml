      <title>MODA: A Unified 3D Diffusion Framework for Multi-Task Target-Aware Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for classifying Monoamine Neurotransmitters by applying Machine Learning on UV plasmonic-engineered Auto Fluorescence Time Decay Series (AFTDS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic nanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule detection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative plasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free, label-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great sensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we employ ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a central role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative evaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate the superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The results reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to silicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification accuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap between nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of AlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves the way for probe-free, label-free biomolecule profiling, offering transformative implications for biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data, literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Machine Learning-Assisted Protein Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling based on Machine Learning (ML) is becoming a central component of protein engineering workflows. This perspective presents the elements necessary to develop effective, reliable, and reproducible ML models, and a set of guidelines for ML developments for protein engineering. This includes a critical discussion of software engineering good practices for development and evaluation of ML-based protein engineering projects, emphasizing supervised learning. These guidelines cover all the necessary steps for ML development, from data acquisition to model deployment. Additionally, the present perspective provides practical resources for the implementation of the outlined guidelines. These recommendations are also intended to support editors and scientific journals in enforcing good practices in ML-based protein engineering publications, promoting high standards across the community. With this, the aim is to further contribute to improved ML transparency and credibility by easing the adoption of software engineering best practices into ML development for protein engineering. We envision that the wide adoption and continuous update of best practices will encourage informed use of ML on real-world problems related to protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Enzyme Mining: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzyme mining is rapidly evolving as a data-driven strategy to identify biocatalysts with tailored functions from the vast landscape of uncharacterized proteins. The integration of machine learning into these workflows enables high-throughput prediction of enzyme functions, including Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms, substrate specificity, and key catalytic properties such as kinetic parameters, optimal temperature, pH, solubility, and thermophilicity. This review provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art machine learning models and highlights representative case studies that demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating enzyme discovery.
  Despite notable progress, current approaches remain limited by data scarcity, model generalizability, and interpretability. We discuss emerging strategies to overcome these challenges, including multi-task learning, integration of multi-modal data, and explainable AI. Together, these developments establish ML-guided enzyme mining as a scalable and predictive framework for uncovering novel biocatalysts, with broad applications in biocatalysis, biotechnology, and synthetic biology.</description>
