      <title>LemonadeBench: Evaluating the Economic Intuition of Large Language Models in Simple Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LemonadeBench v0.5, a minimal benchmark for evaluating economic intuition, long-term planning, and decision-making under uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) through a simulated lemonade stand business. Models must manage inventory with expiring goods, set prices, choose operating hours, and maximize profit over a 30-day period-tasks that any small business owner faces daily. All models demonstrate meaningful economic agency by achieving profitability, with performance scaling dramatically by sophistication-from basic models earning minimal profits to frontier models capturing 70% of theoretical optimal, a greater than 10x improvement. Yet our decomposition of business efficiency across six dimensions reveals a consistent pattern: models achieve local rather than global optimization, excelling in select areas while exhibiting surprising blind spots elsewhere.</description>

      <title>A-H Premium and the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SHHK) affects the A-H share price premium and whether the policy impact depends on market efficiency. Using monthly data for 67 Shanghai-listed A-H dual-listed firms from January 2011 to May 2019, we estimate a dynamic panel model with two-step system GMM to account for premium persistence and potential endogeneity. Market efficiency is proxied by trading-friction measures derived from daily high-low price ranges. We find that the implementation of SHHK is associated with an average 18.4% increase in the A-H premium. However, this effect is heterogeneous. The marginal policy impact is stronger for firms operating in less efficient markets and weaker for those with higher efficiency, indicating that pre-existing trading frictions condition the policy outcome. We find no significant response at the announcement stage. Placebo tests and alternative efficiency measures confirm the robustness of the efficiency-dependent effect. Overall, the results highlight the role of the information environment in shaping liberalization outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Financial Brain Scan of the LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan" large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent, lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Probability of Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07935v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the dependence of market-based statistical moments of returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade values. We use Markowitz's definition of value weighted return of a portfolio as the definition of market-based average return of trades during the averaging period. Then we derive the dependence of market-based volatility and higher statistical moments of returns on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current and past trade values. We derive the approximations of the characteristic function and the probability of returns by a finite number q of market-based statistical moments. To forecast market-based average and volatility of returns at horizon T, one should predict the first two statistical moments and correlation of current and past trade values at the same horizon. We discuss the economic reasons that limit the number of predicted statistical moments of returns by the first two. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of probability of returns by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of returns.</description>
