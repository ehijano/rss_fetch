      <title>Ergodic Theorems for Quantum Trajectories under Disordered Generalized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum trajectories arising from disordered, repeated generalized measurements, which have the structure of Markov chains in random environments (MCRE) with dynamically-defined transition probabilities; we call these disordered quantum trajectories. Under the assumption that the underlying disordered open quantum dynamical system approaches a unique equilibrium in time averages, we establish a strong law of large numbers for measurement outcomes arising from disordered quantum trajectories, which follows after we establish general annealed ergodic theorems for the corresponding MCRE. The type of disorder our model allows includes the random settings where the disorder is i.i.d. or Markovian, the periodic (resp. quasiperiodic) settings where the disorder has periodic (resp. quasiperiodic) structure, and the nonrandom setting where the disorder is constant through time. In particular, our work extends the earlier noise-free results of K\"ummerer and Maassen to the present disordered framework.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U&gt;0$ and $t&gt;0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hodograph equations for the Euler equation in curved spaces with constant pressure are discussed. It is shown that the use of known results concerning geodesics and associated integrals allows to construct several types of hodograph equations. These hodograph equations provide us with various classes of solutions of the Euler equation, including stationary solutions. Particular cases of cone and sphere in the 3-dimensional Eulidean space are analysed in detail. Euler equation on the sphere in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is considered too.</description>

      <title>The Periodic Table and the Group SO(4,4)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic system of chemical elements is represented within the framework of the weight diagram of the Lie algebra of the fourth rank of the rotation group of an eight-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space. The hydrogen realization of the Cartan subalgebra and Weyl generators of the group algebra is studied. The root structure of the subalgebras of the group algebra of a conformal group in the framework of a twofold covering is analyzed. Based on the analysis, the Cartan-Weyl basis of the group algebra is determined. The root and weight diagrams are constructed. A mass formula associated with each node of the weight diagram is introduced. Spin is interpreted as the fourth generator of the Cartan subalgebra, whose two eigenvalues correspond to two three-dimensional projections of the weight diagram containing elements of the periodic system from hydrogen to moscovium (the first projection) and from helium to oganesson (the second projection). One of the main advantages of the proposed group-theoretic construction of the periodic system is the natural inclusion of antimatter in the general scheme.</description>

      <title>Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of topological defects which wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory defined on a closed manifold $M$. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and the global structure of $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds $(M,F)$ where $F$ is Poincar\'e dual to some characteristic class. This concept is discussed in the mathematics literature, and shown here to have meaningful physical interpretations related to defects. In our examples we will mainly focus on the case where $M$ is 4-dimensional and $F$ has codimension 2. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls, to determine the conditions on which dimensions a higher-form finite symmetry can spontaneously break. We explicitly study the cases of higher-form $\mathbb Z/2$ symmetry, but the method can be generalized to other groups.</description>

      <title>Classical facets of quantum integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a review of the works devoted to understanding and reinterpretation of the theory of quantum integrable models solvable by Bethe ansatz in terms of the theory of purely classical soliton equations. Remarkably, studying polynomial solutions of the latter by methods of the classical soliton theory, one is able to develop a method to solve the spectral problem for the former which is alternative to the Bethe ansatz procedure. Our main examples are the generalized inhomogeneous spins chains with twisted boundary conditions from the quantum side and the modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy of nonlinear differential-difference equations from the classical side. In this paper, we restrict ourselves by quantum spin chains with rational $GL(n)$-invariant $R$-matrices (of the XXX type). Also, the connection of quantum spin chains with classical soliton equations implies a close interrelation between the spectral problem for spin chains and integrable many-body systems of classical mechanics such as Calogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Scheider models, which is known as the quantum-classical duality. Revisiting this topic, we suggest a simpler and more instructive proof of this kind of duality.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization, Fermions, and Mod 8 Periodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), time reversal (T), and fermion parity $(-1)^{\rm F}$ are basic discrete spacetime and internal symmetries of the Dirac fermions. In this article, we determine the group, called the C-R-T fractionalization, which is a group extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm C}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm R}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm T}$ by the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, and its extension class in all spacetime dimensions $d$, for a single-particle fermion theory. For Dirac fermions, with the canonical CRT symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm CRT}$, the C-R-T fractionalization has two possibilities that only depend on spacetime dimensions $d$ modulo 8, which are order-16 nonabelian groups, including the famous Pauli group. For Majorana fermions, we determine the R-T fractionalization in all spacetime dimensions $d=0,1,2,3,4\mod8$, an order-8 abelian or nonabelian group. For Weyl fermions, we determine the C or T fractionalization in all even spacetime dimensions $d$, which is an order-4 abelian group. We only have an order-2 $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ group for Majorana-Weyl fermions. We determine the maximal number of linearly independent Dirac and Majorana mass terms and construct them explicitly. We also discuss how the conventional Dirac and Majorana mass terms break the symmetries C, R, or T. We study the domain wall dimensional reduction of the fermions and their C-R-T fractionalization: from $d$-dim Dirac to $(d-1)$-dim Dirac or Weyl and from $d$-dim Majorana to $(d-1)$-dim Majorana or Majorana-Weyl.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Penrose-Wall singularity theorem in the full semiclassical gravity regime, significantly expanding its range of validity. To accomplish this, we modify the definition of quantum-trapped surfaces without affecting their genericity. Our theorem excludes controlled "bounces" in the interior of a black hole and in a large class of cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between matter and causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We focus on the Ising model coupled to CDT, contrasting this with Liouville gravity and the relation to the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula. We demonstrate analytically for the quenched model that the conformal dimensions of fields on CDT align with those on a fixed lattice. We do this using a combination of lattice methods and adapting the Duplantier-Sheffield framework to CDT, emphasizing the one-dimensional nature of CDT and its description via a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Bridging statistical mechanics and thermodynamics away from equilibrium: a data-driven approach for learning internal variables and their dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics with internal variables is a common approach in continuum mechanics to model inelastic (i.e., non-equilibrium) material behavior. While this approach is computationally and theoretically attractive, it currently lacks a well-established statistical mechanics foundation. As a result, internal variables are typically chosen phenomenologically and lack a direct link to the underlying physics which hinders the predictability of the theory. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning approach that is consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The proposed approach leverages the following techniques (i) the information bottleneck (IB) method to ensure that the learned internal variables are functions of the microstates and are capable of capturing the salient feature of the microscopic distribution; (ii) conditional normalizing flows to represent arbitrary probability distributions of the microscopic states as functions of the state variables; and (iii) Variational Onsager Neural Networks (VONNs) to guarantee thermodynamic consistency and Markovianity of the learned evolution equations. The resulting framework, called IB-VONNs, is tested on two problems of colloidal systems, governed at the microscale by overdamped Langevin dynamics. The first one is a prototypical model for a colloidal particle in an optical trap, which can be solved analytically, and thus ideal to verify the framework. The second problem is a one-dimensional phase-transforming system, whose macroscopic description still lacks a statistical mechanics foundation under general conditions. The results in both cases indicate that the proposed machine learning strategy can indeed bridge statistical mechanics and thermodynamics with internal variables away from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>L2 geometric ergodicity for the kinetic Langevin process with non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics models, the invariant measure $\mu$ of the process does not have an explicit density. In particular the adjoint $L^*$ in $L^2(\mu)$ of the generator $L$ is unknown and many classical techniques fail in this situation. An important progress has been made in [5] where functional inequalities are obtained for non-explicit steady states of kinetic equations under rather general conditions. However in [5] in the kinetic case the geometric ergodicity is only deduced from the functional inequalities for the case with conservative forces, corresponding to explicit steady states. In this note we obtain $L^2$ convergence rates in the non-equilibrium case.</description>

      <title>New vacuum boundary effects of massive field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical arguments suggest that the Casimir energy in 2+1 dimensions for gauge theories exponentially decays with the distance between the boundaries. The phenomenon has also been observed by non-perturbative numerical simulations. The dependence of this exponential decay on the different boundary conditions could help to better understand the infrared behavior of these theories and in particular their mass spectrum. A similar behavior is expected in 3+1 dimensions. Motivated by this feature we analyze the dependence of the exponential decay of Casimir energy for different boundary conditions of massive scalar fields in 3+1 dimensional spacetimes. We show that the boundary conditions classify in two different families according on the rate of this exponential decay of the Casimir energy. If the boundary conditions on each boundary are independent (e.g. both boundaries satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions), the Casimir energy has a exponential decay that is two times faster than when the boundary conditions interconnect the two boundary plates (e.g. for periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions). These results will be useful for a comparison with the Casimir energy in the non-perturbative regime of non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We show that quadratic Hamiltonians in involution coming from a St\"ackel system are quantizable, in the sense that one can construct commutative self-adjoint operators whose symbols are the quadratic Hamiltonians. Moreover, they allow multiplicative separation of variables. This proves a conjecture explicitly formulated in [3].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates both direct and inverse problems of the variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which attracts increasing attentions in both practical applications and theoretical aspects. Based on the perturbation method, which transfers the original model to an equivalent but more tractable form, the analytical extensibility of the solutions and the weak unique continuation principle are proved, which results in the uniqueness of the inverse space-dependent source problem from local internal observation. Then, based on the variational identity connecting the inversion input data with the unknown source function, we propose a weak norm and prove the conditional stability for the inverse problem in this norm. The iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are employed to numerically reconstruct the smooth and non-smooth sources, respectively. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>The global estimate for regular axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction are considered. in a bounded cylinder $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r, v_{\varphi}, \omega_{\varphi}$ vanish on the lateral part $S_1$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ and $v_z, \omega_{\varphi}, \partial_z v_{\varphi}$ vanish on the top and bottom of the cylinder, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates and $\omega=\text{rot} v$ is the vorticity of the fluid. Moreover, vanishing of the heat flux through the boundary is imposed. Assuming existence of a sufficiently regular solution we derive a global a priori estimate in terms of data. The estimate is such that a global regular solutions can be proved. We prove the estimate because some reduction of nonlinearity are found.Moreover, deriving the global estimate for a local solution implies a possibility of its extension in time as long as the estimate holds.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. Moreover, we assume a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter term. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. Specifically, we introduce dimensionless variables based on the Hubble normalization approach and a new set based on the matter-scalar field normalization. These two sets of variables allow for a comprehensive phase space analysis. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>

      <title>Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Riemannian metrics which are superintegrable in the class of polynomial in momenta integrals. The study is based on our main technical result, Theorem 3, which states that the Poisson bracket of two polynomial in momenta integrals is an algebraic function of
  the integrals and of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that two-dimensional superintegrable Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems, and give arguments supporting this conjecture. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that
  the metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$, are not superintegrable and in particular do not admit nontrivial polynomial in momenta integral of degree less than $k$. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995.</description>

The geometrical background material is summarized in a unified manner. Transport theorems for use in generic balance laws are given with proofs since they provide some insight into the results.

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generation of chaos in the cumulant hierarchy of the stochastic Kac model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time-evolution of cumulants of velocities and kinetic energies in the stochastic Kac model for velocity exchange of $N$ particles, with the aim of quantifying how fast these degrees of freedom become chaotic in a time scale in which the collision rate for each particle is order one. Chaos here is understood in the sense of the original Sto\ss zahlansatz, as an almost complete independence of the particle velocities which we measure by the magnitude of their cumulants up to a finite, but arbitrary order. Known spectral gap results imply that typical initial densities converge to uniform distribution on the constant energy sphere at a time which has order of $N$ expected collisions. We prove that the finite order cumulants converge to their small stationary values much faster, already at a time scale of order one collisions. The proof relies on stability analysis of the closed, but nonlinear, hierarchy of energy cumulants around the fixed point formed by their values in the stationary spherical distribution. It provides the first example of an application of the cumulant hierarchy method to control the properties of a microscopic model related to kinetic theory.</description>

Abstract: The non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NcHO) and 2p-quantum Rabi models (2pQRM) are extensions of harmonic oscillators. The purpose of this paper is to give a relationship between NcHO and 2pQRM, and the fiber decomposition of NcHO by 2pQRM is shown. We also construct Feynman-Kac formulas of NcHO and 2pQRM. Then asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function of 2pQRM is considered.</description>

      <title>Molecular mechanism of Abeta alloform co-aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, biologically relevant processes may be governed by rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple Abeta peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we develop using the mathematics of symmetry a highly general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces enable the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general solution will encourage its widespread adoption by researchers modelling filamentous self-assembly kinetics, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we study spacetimes of cosmological interest, without making any symmetry assumptions. We prove a rigid Hawking singularity theorem for positive cosmological constant, which sharpens known results. In particular, it implies that any spacetime with $\operatorname{Ric} \geq -ng$ in timelike directions and containing a compact Cauchy hypersurface with mean curvature $H \geq n$ is timelike incomplete. We also study the properties of cosmological time and volume functions, addressing questions such as: When do they satisfy the regularity condition? When are the level sets Cauchy hypersurfaces? What can one say about the mean curvature of the level sets? This naturally leads to consideration of Hawking type singularity theorems for Cauchy surfaces satisfying mean curvature inequalities in a certain weak sense.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>

Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. Key estimates for solutions are based on the analyticity of solutions in the space of vector spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector decorrelation for random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the eigenvectors of random matrices, showing that even small perturbations make the eigenvectors almost orthogonal. More precisely, we consider two deformed Wigner matrices $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ and show that their bulk eigenvectors become asymptotically orthogonal as soon as $\mathrm{Tr}(D_1-D_2)^2\gg 1$, or their respective energies are separated on a scale much bigger than the local eigenvalue spacing. Furthermore, we show that quadratic forms of eigenvectors of $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ with any deterministic matrix $A\in\mathbf{C}^{N\times N}$ in a specific subspace of codimension one are of size $N^{-1/2}$. This proves a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to eigenvectors belonging to two different spectral families.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the generic problem of optimal quantum state preparation for open quantum systems. It is well known that open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The latter requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is, in general, challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems, for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by direct sampling of the cost objective. In this work, we derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that are amenable to PI control techniques, and propose a corresponding algorithm, which we call Quantum Diffusion Control (QDC). Unlike conventional quantum control algorithms, QDC avoids computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal control. Instead, it employs adaptive importance sampling, a technique where the controls are iteratively improved based on global averages over quantum trajectories. We also demonstrate that QDC, used as an annealer in the environmental coupling strength, finds high accuracy solutions for unitary (noiseless) quantum control problems. We further discuss the implementation of this technique on quantum hardware. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples of open-loop control for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Abelian function fields on Jacobian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the fields of multiply periodic, or Kleinian $\wp$-functions are exposed. Such a field arises on the Jacobian variety of an algebraic curve, and provides natural algebraic models of the Jacobian and Kummer varieties, possesses the addition law, and accommodates dynamical equations with solutions. All this will be explained in detail for plane algebraic curves in their canonical forms. Example of hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic curves are presented.</description>
