      <title>Conditional Choice Probability Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with 2-period Finite Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the work of Arcidiacono and Miller (2011, 2019) by introducing a novel characterization of finite dependence within dynamic discrete choice models, demonstrating that numerous models display 2-period finite dependence. We recast finite dependence as a problem of sequentially searching for weights and introduce a computationally efficient method for determining these weights by utilizing the Kronecker product structure embedded in state transitions. With the estimated weights, we develop a computationally attractive Conditional Choice Probability estimator with 2-period finite dependence. The computational efficacy of our proposed estimator is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Inference on common trends in functional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study statistical inference on unit roots and cointegration for time series in a Hilbert space. We develop statistical inference on the number of common stochastic trends embedded in the time series, i.e., the dimension of the nonstationary subspace. We also consider tests of hypotheses on the nonstationary and stationary subspaces themselves. The Hilbert space can be of an arbitrarily large dimension, and our methods remain asymptotically valid even when the time series of interest takes values in a subspace of possibly unknown dimension. This has wide applicability in practice; for example, to the case of cointegrated vector time series that are either high-dimensional or of finite dimension, to high-dimensional factor model that includes a finite number of nonstationary factors, to cointegrated curve-valued (or function-valued) time series, and to nonstationary dynamic functional factor models. We include two empirical illustrations to the term structure of interest rates and labor market indices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Item-Level Outcome Data: Insights from Item Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) are common in applied causal inference research. However, when outcomes are latent variables assessed via psychometric instruments such as educational tests, standard methods ignore the potential HTE that may exist among the individual items of the outcome measure. Failing to account for "item-level" HTE (IL-HTE) can lead to both estimated standard errors that are too small and identification challenges in the estimation of treatment-by-covariate interaction effects. We demonstrate how Item Response Theory (IRT) models that estimate a treatment effect for each assessment item can both address these challenges and provide new insights into HTE generally. This study articulates the theoretical rationale for the IL-HTE model and demonstrates its practical value using data from 20 randomized controlled trials containing 2.3 million item responses in economics, education, and health research. Our results show that the IL-HTE model reveals item-level variation masked by average treatment effects, provides more accurate statistical inference, allows for estimates of the generalizability of causal effects, resolves identification problems in the estimation of interaction effects, and provides estimates of standardized treatment effect sizes corrected for attenuation due to measurement error.</description>

      <title>Identifying and exploiting alpha in linear asset pricing models with strong, semi-strong, and latent factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The risk premia of traded factors are the sum of factor means and a parameter vector we denote by {\phi} which is identified from the cross section regression of alpha of individual securities on the vector of factor loadings. If phi is non-zero one can construct "phi-portfolios" which exploit the systematic components of non-zero alpha. We show that for known values of betas and when phi is non-zero there exist phi-portfolios that dominate mean-variance portfolios. The paper then proposes a two-step bias corrected estimator of phi and derives its asymptotic distribution allowing for idiosyncratic pricing errors, weak missing factors, and weak error cross-sectional dependence. Small sample results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimator has the correct size with good power properties. The paper also provides an empirical application to a large number of U.S. securities with risk factors selected from a large number of potential risk factors according to their strength and constructs phi-portfolios and compares their Sharpe ratios to mean variance and S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</description>
