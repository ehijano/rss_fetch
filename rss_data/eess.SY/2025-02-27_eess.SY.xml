      <title>Identification and Characterization for Disruptions in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disruptions in the National Airspace System (NAS) lead to significant losses to air traffic system participants and raise public concerns. We apply two methods, cluster analysis and anomaly detection models, to identify operational disruptions with geographical patterns in the NAS since 2010. We identify four types and twelve categories of days of operations, distinguished according to air traffic system operational performance and geographical patterns of disruptions. Two clusters--NAS Disruption and East Super Disruption, accounting for 0.8% and 1.2% of the days respectively, represent the most disrupted days of operations in U.S. air traffic system. Another 16.5% of days feature less severe but still significant disruptions focused on certain regions of the NAS, while on the remaining 81.5% of days the NAS operates relatively smoothly. Anomaly detection results show good agreement with cluster results and further distinguish days in the same cluster by severity of disruptions. Results show an increasing trend in frequency of disruptions especially post-COVID. Additionally, disruptions happen most frequently in the summer and winter.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Data-Driven Ship Dynamics Model: Enhancing Physics-Based Motion Prediction with Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous navigation systems on ships necessitates accurate motion prediction models tailored to individual vessels. Traditional physics-based models, while grounded in hydrodynamic principles, often fail to account for ship-specific behaviors under real-world conditions. Conversely, purely data-driven models offer specificity but lack interpretability and robustness in edge cases. This study proposes a data-driven physics-based model that integrates physics-based equations with data-driven parameter optimization, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to ensure interpretability and adaptability. The model incorporates physics-based components such as 3-DoF dynamics, rudder, and propeller forces, while parameters such as resistance curve and rudder coefficients are optimized using synthetic data. By embedding domain knowledge into the parameter optimization process, the fitted model maintains physical consistency. Validation of the approach is realized with two container ships by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, predictions against ground-truth trajectories. The results demonstrate significant improvements, in predictive accuracy and reliability, of the data-driven physics-based models over baseline physics-based models tuned with traditional marine engineering practices. The fitted models capture ship-specific behaviors in diverse conditions with their predictions being, 51.6% (ship A) and 57.8% (ship B) more accurate, 72.36% (ship A) and 89.67% (ship B) more consistent.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Generalized Super-Twisting Algorithm Robust Control of Linear Time-Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel procedure for robust control design of linear time-invariant systems using a Multivariable Generalized Super-Twisting Algorithm (MGSTA). The proposed approach addresses robust stability and performance conditions, considering convex bounded parameter uncertainty in all matrices of the plant state-space realization and Lipschitz exogenous disturbances. The primary characteristic of the closed-loop system, sliding mode finite-time convergence, is thoroughly examined and evaluated. The design conditions, obtained through the proposal of a novel max-type non-differentiable piecewise-continuous Lyapunov function are formulated as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), which can be efficiently solved using existing computational tools. A fault-tolerant MGSTA control is designed for a mechanical system with three degrees of freedom, illustrating the efficacy of the proposed LMI approach.</description>

      <title>A Novel Topology Recovery Method for Low Voltage Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) suffer from limited visibility due to sparse or nonexistent measurement systems, leaving distribution network service providers with incomplete data. Maintenance activities, such as transformer upgrades and power line replacements, sometimes go undocumented, leading to unmonitored topology changes. This lack of oversight hinders network optimization, fault detection, and outage management, as utilities cannot fully monitor or control the system. With the rise of electric vehicles, having an accurate understanding of LVDN topology is crucial to avoid infrastructure damage from potential overloads. This paper introduces a method to reconstruct LVDN topology using incremental voltage and current changes from smart meters at customer endpoints. The approach identifies and maps network topologies with high accuracy, overcoming limitations of prior methods by discarding unrealistic assumptions. Specifically, it addresses grids with fewer than three pole connections and employs an AC power flow model over simplified DC approximations. Simulations across diverse configurations validate the method's effectiveness in accurately reconstructing LVDN topologies, enhancing real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Sparse Spectrahedral Shadows for State Estimation and Reachability Analysis: Set Operations, Validations and Order Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set representations are the foundation of various set-based approaches in state estimation, reachability analysis and fault diagnosis. In this paper, we investigate spectrahedral shadows, a class of nonlinear geometric objects previously studied in semidefinite programming and real algebraic geometry. We demonstrate spectrahedral shadows generalize traditional and emerging set representations like ellipsoids, zonotopes, constrained zonotopes and ellipsotopes. Analytical forms of set operations are provided including linear map, linear inverse map, Minkowski sum, intersection, Cartesian product, Minkowski-Firey Lp sum, convex hull, conic hull and polytopic map, all of which are implemented without approximation in polynomial time. In addition, we develop set validation and order reduction techniques for spectrahedral shadows, thereby establishing spectrahedral shadows as a set representation applicable to a range of set-based tasks.</description>

      <title>Polarization Angle Scanning for Wide-band Millimeter-wave Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (MMW) technology has been widely utilized in human security screening applications due to its superior penetration capabilities through clothing and safety for human exposure. However, existing methods largely rely on fixed polarization modes, neglecting the potential insights from variations in target echoes with respect to incident polarization. This study provides a theoretical analysis of the cross-polarization echo power as a function of the incident polarization angle under linear polarization conditions. Additionally, based on the transmission characteristics of multi-layer medium, we extended the depth spectrum model employed in direct detection to accommodate scenarios involving multi-layered structures. Building on this foundation, by obtaining multiple depth spectrums through polarization angle scanning, we propose the Polarization Angle-Depth Matrix to characterize target across both the polarization angle and depth dimensions in direct detection. Simulations and experimental validations confirm its accuracy and practical value in detecting concealed weapons in human security screening scenarios.</description>

      <title>Naked Eye Three-dimensional Display System Based on Time-multiplexed Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our group is developing a multi-user eye-tracked 3D display, an evolution of the single-user eye-tracked 3D display that we have already successfully developed. This display utilizes a slanted lenticular setup, where multiple perspective views are shown across the viewing field. Due to the constraints of the lenticular lens parameters, identical views are repeated across the field, limiting eye tracking to a single user. However, this limitation can be addressed using spatio-temporal multiplexing, where view zone groups are presented sequentially with a high frame rate liquid crystal display (LCD) and driver, in combination with a synchronized directional light emitting diode (LED) array. In this paper, we describe the operation and results of the backlight drive electronics, where a prototype using a white LED illumination matrix, a simplified LCD panel, and a linear Fresnel lens array serves as a test bed.</description>

      <title>Modelling Regional Solar Photovoltaic Capacity in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great Britain aims to meet growing electricity demand and achieve a fully decarbonised grid by 2035, targeting 70 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. However, grid constraints and connection delays hinder solar integration. To address these integration challenges, various connection reform processes and policies are being developed [1]. This study supports the connection reforms with a model that estimates regional PV capacity at the NUTS 3 level, explaining 89% of the variation in capacity, with a mean absolute error of 20 MW and a national mean absolute percentage error of 5.4%. Artificial surfaces and agricultural areas are identified as key factors in deployment. The model has three primary applications: disaggregating national PV capacity into regional capacity, benchmarking regional PV deployment between different regions, and forecasting future PV capacity distribution. These applications support grid operators in generation monitoring and strategic grid planning by identifying regions where capacity is likely to be concentrated. This can address grid connection delays, plan network expansions, and resolve land-use conflicts.</description>

      <title>A Direct State-Space Realization of Discrete-Time Linear Parameter-Varying Input-Output Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal state-space (SS) realization of an identified linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output (IO) model usually introduces dynamic and nonlinear dependency of the state-space coefficient functions, complicating stability analysis and controller synthesis. The aim of this paper is to introduce and analyze a direct SS realization of this IO model that avoids this nonlinear and dynamic dependency, at the cost of introducing a nonminimal state. It is shown that this direct SS realization 1) is reachable under a coprimeness condition on the coefficient functions of the IO model and a well-posedness condition on the model order, and 2) is never observable but that the unobservable directions converge to zero in a finite amount of steps, i.e., that the realization is reconstructible. The derived results are illustrated through numerical examples in both the LPV and LTI case.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of singularly perturbed networked control systems over a single channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the emulation-based stabilization of nonlinear networked control systems with two time scales. We address the challenge of using a single communication channel for transmitting both fast and slow variables between the plant and the controller. A novel dual clock mechanism is proposed to schedule transmissions for this purpose. The system is modeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, and singular perturbation analysis is employed to determine individual maximum allowable transmission intervals for both fast and slow variables, ensuring semi-global practical asymptotic stability. Enhanced stability guarantees are also provided under stronger assumptions. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Damping Tuning Considering Random Disturbances Adopting Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios where high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is connected to the grid over long distances, the output of RES exhibits significant fluctuations, making it difficult to accurately characterize. The intermittency and uncertainty of these fluctuations pose challenges to the stability of the power system. This paper proposes a distributionally robust damping optimization control framework (DRDOC) to address the uncertainty in the true distribution of random disturbances caused by RES. First, the installation location of damping controllers and key control parameters are determined through Sobol sensitivity indices and participation factors. Next, a nonlinear relationship between damping and random disturbances is established with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). The uncertainty in the distribution of disturbances is captured by ambiguity sets. The DRDOC is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is further simplified for efficient computation. Finally, the optimal control parameters are derived through convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and distribution robustness of the proposed DRDOC.</description>

      <title>RL-OGM-Parking: Lidar OGM-Based Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Planner for Autonomous Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy, consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world scenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms pure rule-based and learning-based methods. The real-world experiment further validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Switching multiplicative watermark design against covert attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active techniques have been introduced to give better detectability performance for cyber-attack diagnosis in cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, switching multiplicative watermarking is considered, whereby we propose an optimal design strategy to define switching filter parameters. Optimality is evaluated exploiting the so-called output-to-output gain of the closed loop system, including some supposed attack dynamics. A worst-case scenario of a matched covert attack is assumed, presuming that an attacker with full knowledge of the closed-loop system injects a stealthy attack of bounded energy. Our algorithm, given watermark filter parameters at some time instant, provides optimal next-step parameters. Analysis of the algorithm is given, demonstrating its features, and demonstrating that through initialization of certain parameters outside of the algorithm, the parameters of the multiplicative watermarking can be randomized. Simulation shows how, by adopting our method for parameter design, the attacker's impact on performance diminishes.</description>

      <title>Handover-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to complete a mission of flying between two pre-determined locations while maintaining satisfactory communication quality with the ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</description>

      <title>CPG-Based Manipulation with Multi-Module Origami Robot Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulators often face challenges in handling objects of different sizes and materials, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications. This issue is particularly pronounced when manipulating meter-scale objects or those with varying stiffness, as traditional gripping techniques and strategies frequently prove inadequate. In this letter, we introduce a novel surface-based multi-module robotic manipulation framework that utilizes a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based motion generator, combined with a simulation-based optimization method to determine the optimal manipulation parameters for a multi-module origami robotic surface (Ori-Pixel). This approach allows for the manipulation of objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, with varying stiffness and shape. The optimized CPG parameters are tested through both dynamic simulations and a series of prototype experiments involving a wide range of objects differing in size, weight, shape, and material, demonstrating robust manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial high-K AlBN barrier GaN HEMTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Auto-Encoders for Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning in Wilderness Search and Rescue Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilderness search and rescue operations are often carried out over vast landscapes. The search efforts, however, must be undertaken in minimum time to maximize the chance of survival of the victim. Whilst the advent of cheap multicopters in recent years has changed the way search operations are handled, it has not solved the challenges of the massive areas at hand. The problem therefore is not one of complete coverage, but one of maximizing the information gathered in the limited time available. In this work we propose that a combination of a recurrent autoencoder and deep reinforcement learning is a more efficient solution to the search problem than previous pure deep reinforcement learning or optimisation approaches. The autoencoder training paradigm efficiently maximizes the information throughput of the encoder into its latent space representation which deep reinforcement learning is primed to leverage. Without the overhead of independently solving the problem that the recurrent autoencoder is designed for, it is more efficient in learning the control task. We further implement three additional architectures for a comprehensive comparison of the main proposed architecture. Similarly, we apply both soft actor-critic and proximal policy optimisation to provide an insight into the performance of both in a highly non-linear and complex application with a large observation Results show that the proposed architecture is vastly superior to the benchmarks, with soft actor-critic achieving the best performance. This model further outperformed work from the literature whilst having below a fifth of the total learnable parameters and training in a quarter of the time.</description>

      <title>Surface-Based Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligence lies not only in the brain but in the body. The shape of our bodies can influence how we think and interact with the physical world. In robotics research, interacting with the physical world is crucial as it allows robots to manipulate objects in various real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulties in establishing stable force or geometric constraints.
  Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using with flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By changing the position and orientation of these surfaces, objects can be translated, rotated and even flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasp, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels, even enabling the manipulation the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.</description>

      <title>A variational and symplectic framework for model-free control: preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4237</link>
      <description>arXiv:1011.4237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model-free control approach is an advanced control law that requires few information about the process to control. Since its introduction in 2008, numerous applications have been successfully considered, highlighting attractive robustness properties towards tracking efficiency and disturbance rejection. In this work, a variational approach of the model-free control is proposed in order to extend its robustness capabilities. An adaptive formulation of the controller is proposed using the calculus of variations within a symplectic framework, that aims to consider the control law as an optimization problem toward the auto-tuning of its main key parameter. The proposed formulation provides a coupling between the model-free control law and a variational integrator to improve the robustness of the tracking towards process changes and emphasize closed-loop stabilization. Some illustrative examples are discussed to highlight the rightness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Pareto Transistor Sizing of GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust Pareto design approach for transistor sizing of Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs), particularly for power amplifier (PA) and low-noise amplifier (LNA) designs in 5G applications. We consider five key design variables and two settings (PAs and LNAs) where we have multiple objectives. We assess designs based on three critical objectives, evaluating each by its worst-case performance across a range of Gate-Source Voltages ($V_{\text{GS}}$). We conduct simulations across a range of $V_{\text{GS}}$ values to ensure a thorough and robust analysis. For PAs, the optimization goals are to maximize the worst-case modulated average output power ($P_{\text{out,avg}}$) and power-added efficiency ($\text{PAE}_{\text{avg}}$) while minimizing the worst-case average junction temperature ($T_{\text{j,avg}}$) under a modulated 64-QAM signal stimulus. In contrast, for LNAs, the focus is on maximizing the worst-case maximum oscillation frequency ($f_{\text{max}}$) and Gain, and minimizing the worst-case minimum noise figure ($\text{NF}_{\text{min}}$). We utilize a derivative-free optimization method to effectively identify robust Pareto optimal device designs. This approach enhances our comprehension of the trade-off space, facilitating more informed decision-making. Furthermore, this method is general across different applications. Although it does not guarantee a globally optimal design, we demonstrate its effectiveness in GaN transistor sizing. The primary advantage of this method is that it enables the attainment of near-optimal or even optimal designs with just a fraction of the simulations required for an exhaustive full-grid search.</description>

      <title>Position and Time Determination without Prior State Knowledge via Onboard Optical Observations of Delta Scuti Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a navigation concept for solving the lost in space and time problem using optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti variable stars. Only a small number of techniques exist that allow a spacecraft to recover from being lost in both space and time, which can be caused by a failure of the onboard clock and navigation systems. Optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars, which can be collected onboard from star trackers or navigation cameras, may enable autonomous position and time determination without requiring additional equipment or external communication. Our results indicate that less than one day of observation by the OSIRIS-APEX PolyCam may enable position and time determination accuracy within 0.03 au (3$\sigma$) and 3 seconds (3$\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Analysis of a platooned car-following model with different inter-platoon communication levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in vehicle platooning research, the effect of communication capability between platoons is not investigated to a depth of depth. In this paper, we extend a single-platoon car-following (CF) model to multi-platoon CF models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with different inter-platoon communication capabilities. Specifically, we consider forward and backward connection availabilities with delays between platoons. Using linear stability analysis, we discovered that for identical platoons, stability increases with platoon size and connection availabilities and decreases exponentially with large delay. With maximum acceleration and emergency braking constraints integrated into the models, we performed simulations for various cases of CAV platoons and mixed autonomy with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The simulation results for CAV platoons are consistent with theoretical analysis. The mixed autonomy experiments demonstrate that in the ring road scenario, CAV platoons can stabilize HDVs without adaptions, and the effect of distribution is marginal. Overall, this paper provides valuable insights for designing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and managing mixed traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advancing Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is essential for efficient planning and real-time operation in power systems but is NP-hard and non-convex, leading to significant computational challenges. Neural networks (NNs) offer computational speedups in solving OPF but face issues like dependency on large datasets, scalability limitations, and inability to enforce physical constraints, compromising solution reliability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) that integrate quantum computing principles into neural network architectures. Leveraging quantum mechanics properties such as superposition and entanglement, QNNs can capture complex input-output relationships more effectively and learn from small or noisy datasets.To further improve the performance of QNNs and investigate the interplay between classical and quantum components in hybrid architectures, we incorporate advanced techniques, including residual learning and physics-informed machine learning, into the hybrid QNN designs. These enhancements aim to boost convergence efficiency, lower errors, superior generalization, and robustness to quantum noise. Simulation results demonstrate that these enhanced hybrid QNNs outperform typical hybrid QNNs in solving OPF problems. This work provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid QNNs, highlighting the potential of quantum computation for broader applications in power systems.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Observer-Parameterized Control Barrier Function with Adaptive Safety Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a nonlinear disturbance observer-parameterized control barrier function (DOp-CBF) designed for a robust safety control system under external disturbances. This framework emphasizes that the safety bounds are relevant to the disturbances, acknowledging the critical impact of disturbances on system safety. This work incorporates a disturbance observer (DO) as an adaptive mechanism of the safety bounds design. Instead of considering the worst-case scenario, the safety bounds are dynamically adjusted using DO. The forward invariance of the proposed method regardless of the observer error is ensured, and the corresponding optimal control formulation is presented. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations of a cruise control problem under varying road grades. The influence of road grade on the safe distance between vehicles is analyzed and managed using a DO. The results demonstrate the advantages of this approach in maintaining safety and improving system performance under disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) promises to revolutionize mobility and connectivity, integrating vehicles into a mobile Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN). Meanwhile, 5G technologies and mobile edge computing further support this vision by facilitating real-time connectivity and empowering massive access to the Internet. Within this context, IoT-oriented WSNs play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, offering affordable alternatives for traffic monitoring and management. Efficient sensor selection thus represents a critical concern while deploying WSNs on urban networks. In this paper, we provide an overview of such a notably hard problem. The contribution is twofold: (i) surveying state-of-the-art model-based techniques for efficient sensor selection in traffic flow monitoring, emphasizing challenges of sensor placement, and (ii) advocating for {the development of} data-driven methodologies to enhance sensor deployment efficacy and traffic modeling accuracy. Further considerations underscore the importance of data-driven approaches for adaptive transportation systems aligned with the IoV paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Physical-Virtual Integration in V2X-Enabled Connected Vehicle Corridors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) enhance safety and mobility by integrating cyber and physical transportation systems. A key component of T-CPS is the Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation that enables simulation, analysis, and optimization through real-time data exchange and communication. Although existing studies have explored DTs for vehicles, communications, pedestrians, and traffic, real-world validations and implementations of DTs that encompass infrastructure, vehicles, signals, communications, and more remain limited due to several challenges. These include accessing real-world connected infrastructure, integrating heterogeneous, multi-sourced data, ensuring real-time data processing, and synchronizing the digital and physical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a traffic DT based on a real-world connected vehicle corridor. Leveraging the Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) infrastructure in the corridor, along with communication, computing, and simulation technologies, the proposed DT accurately replicates physical vehicle behaviors, signal timing, communications, and traffic patterns within the virtual environment. Building upon the previous data pipeline, the digital system ensures robust synchronization with the physical environment. Moreover, the DT's scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. Furthermore, its ability to provide feedback to the physical system is demonstrated through applications such as signal timing adjustments, vehicle advisory messages, and incident notifications. The proposed DT is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the reliability and safety of transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</description>

Abstract: As prominent real-time safety-critical reactive control techniques, Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) work for control affine systems in general but result in local minima in the generated trajectories and consequently cannot ensure convergence to the goals. Contrarily, Modulation of Dynamical Systems (Mod-DSs), including normal, reference, and on-manifold Mod-DS, achieve obstacle avoidance with few and even no local minima but have trouble optimally minimizing the difference between the constrained and the unconstrained controller outputs, and its applications are limited to fully-actuated systems. We dive into the theoretical foundations of CBF-QP and Mod-DS, proving that despite their distinct origins, normal Mod-DS is a special case of CBF-QP, and reference Mod-DS's solutions are mathematically connected to that of the CBF-QP through one equation. Building on top of the unveiled theoretical connections between CBF-QP and Mod-DS, reference Mod-based CBF-QP and on-manifold Mod-based CBF-QP controllers are proposed to combine the strength of CBF-QP and Mod-DS approaches and realize local-minimum-free reactive obstacle avoidance for control affine systems in general. We validate our methods in both simulated hospital environments and real-world experiments using Ridgeback for fully-actuated systems and Fetch robots for underactuated systems. Mod-based CBF-QPs outperform CBF-QPs as well as the optimally constrained-enforcing Mod-DS approaches we proposed in all experiments.</description>

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>

Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</description>

      <title>GPUArmor: A Hardware-Software Co-design for Efficient and Scalable Memory Safety on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory safety errors continue to pose a significant threat to current computing systems, and graphics processing units (GPUs) are no exception. A prominent class of memory safety algorithms is allocation-based solutions. The key idea is to maintain each allocation's metadata (base address and size) in a disjoint table and retrieve it at runtime to verify memory accesses. While several previous solutions have adopted allocation-based algorithms (e.g., cuCatch and GPUShield), they typically suffer from high memory overheads or scalability problems. In this work, we examine the key characteristics of real-world GPU workloads and observe several differences between GPU and CPU applications regarding memory access patterns, memory footprint, number of live allocations, and active allocation working set. Our observations motivate GPUArmor, a hardware-software co-design framework for memory safety on GPUs. We show that a simple compiler analysis combined with lightweight hardware support using a small Memory Lookaside Buffer (MLB) can help prevent spatial and temporal memory violations on modern GPU workloads with 2.3% average run time overheads. More importantly, GPUArmor achieves speed-of-light performance with negligible storage requirements. This result benefits both base and bounds solutions and memory tagging techniques, which we showcase with GPUArmor-HWOnly, a variation of GPUArmor that does not require recompilation, and achieves 2.2% slowdowns while significantly reducing storage overheads beyond traditional memory tagging approaches.</description>
