      <title>The first alumni donation in 1880 in Japan: social image and the open-academic record system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1880, Keio, a private school in Japan, was in jeopardy of being closed. To cope with the situation, the school first created a fundraising campaign during the 18801-90 period. The school was established in 1857, and since 1861, the list covering all students academic record has been distributed not only to teachers but also to all students. Individual-level historical academic record was integrated with the list of contributors. Using the data, we compared persons who had learned in Keio before and after the system was introduced. The main findings are presented as follows. first, graduates who share the academic record are more likely to contribute, and their amount of donation is larger; second, the class size is negatively correlated with the likelihood of contribution and with its amount; and third, academic performance, as shown in the list, is positively correlated with the likelihood of contribution but not with the amount of donation, using a sub-sample of those who shared the list. The introduction of the system strengthened the community network and role of social image shared by the members. This resulted in a successful fundraising for the school, an unprecedented feat in the history of Japan.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Link and Flow Prediction in Bank Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of both the existence and weight of network links at future time points is essential as complex networks evolve over time. Traditional methods, such as vector autoregression and factor models, have been applied to small, dense networks, but become computationally impractical for large-scale, sparse, and complex networks. Some machine learning models address dynamic link prediction, but few address the simultaneous prediction of both link presence and weight. Therefore, we introduce a novel model that dynamically predicts link presence and weight by dividing the task into two sub-tasks: predicting remittance ratios and forecasting the total remittance volume. We use a self-attention mechanism that combines temporal-topological neighborhood features to predict remittance ratios and use a separate model to forecast the total remittance volume. We achieve the final prediction by multiplying the outputs of these models. We validated our approach using two real-world datasets: a cryptocurrency network and bank transfer network.</description>

      <title>A Market for Lemons? Strategic Directions for a Vigilant Application of Artificial Intelligence in Entrepreneurship Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI adoption (e.g., using machine learning, deep learning, or large language models as research methods) and the increasing availability of big data have the potential to bring about the most significant transformation in entrepreneurship scholarship the field has ever witnessed. This article makes a pressing meta-contribution by highlighting a significant risk of unproductive knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurship research amid the AI revolution. It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance for future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance. Drawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the potential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's evolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct validity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are particularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle, where the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the black box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent uncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in suboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market for lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact. However, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could herald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research. We discuss the necessary actions to elevate the field to a higher level of AI resilience while steadfastly maintaining its foundational principles and core values.</description>

      <title>Contract Structure and Risk Aversion in Longevity Risk Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an economic framework to assess optimal longevity risk transfers between institutions, focusing on the interactions between a buyer exposed to long-term longevity risk and a seller offering longevity protection. While most longevity risk transfers have occurred in the reinsurance sector, where global reinsurers provide long-term protections, the capital market for longevity risk transfer has struggled to gain traction, resulting in only a few short-term instruments. We investigate how differences in risk aversion between the two parties affect the equilibrium structure of longevity risk transfer contracts, contrasting `static' contracts that offer long-term protection with `dynamic' contracts that provide short-term, variable coverage. Our analysis shows that static contracts are preferred by more risk-averse buyers, while dynamic contracts are favored by more risk-averse sellers who are reluctant to commit to long-term agreements. When incorporating information asymmetry through ambiguity, we find that ambiguity can cause more risk-averse sellers to stop offering long-term contracts. With the assumption that global reinsurers, acting as sellers in the reinsurance sector and buyers in the capital market, are generally less risk-averse than other participants, our findings provide theoretical explanations for current market dynamics and suggest that short-term instruments offer valuable initial steps toward developing an efficient and active capital market for longevity risk transfer.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Competitive Market Behavior Through LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to conduct market experiments, aiming to understand their capability to comprehend competitive market dynamics. We model the behavior of market agents in a controlled experimental setting, assessing their ability to converge toward competitive equilibria. The results reveal the challenges current LLMs face in replicating the dynamic decision-making processes characteristic of human trading behavior. Unlike humans, LLMs lacked the capacity to achieve market equilibrium. The research demonstrates that while LLMs provide a valuable tool for scalable and reproducible market simulations, their current limitations necessitate further advancements to fully capture the complexities of market behavior. Future work that enhances dynamic learning capabilities and incorporates elements of behavioral economics could improve the effectiveness of LLMs in the economic domain, providing new insights into market dynamics and aiding in the refinement of economic policies.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has been shown to enhance individual productivity in a guided setting. While it is also likely to transform processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of origination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration tasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. We study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime example of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and unguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October 2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for R. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that GenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions, which are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work, significantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly origination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was exacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns that, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between origination and iterative solutions may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</description>
