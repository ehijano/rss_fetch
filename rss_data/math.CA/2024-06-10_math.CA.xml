      <title>Quasiconformal mappings and the rank of $\tfrac {dDf}{d|Df|}$ for $f\in BV(\mathbb{R}^n; \mathbb{R}^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a relaxed version $H_f^{\textrm{fine}}$ of the distortion number $H_f$ that is used to define quasiconformal mappings. Then we show that for a BV function $f\in BV(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^n)$, for $|Df|$-a.e. $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ it holds that $H_{f^*}^{\textrm{fine}}(x)&lt;\infty$ if and only if $\tfrac{dDf}{d|Df|}(x)$ has full rank.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of decoding a translation invariant measure from a single set of positive Lebesgue measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a translation invariant measure on $(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ and let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. If there exists an open set $U$ such that $0&lt;\mu(U)=\lambda(U)&lt;\infty$, it is a simple exercise to show that $\mu=\lambda|_{\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)}$. Is the same conclusion true if $U$ is merely a Borel set?
  The main purpose of this short note is to construct a measure that provides a negative answer to this question. Incidentally, this construction provides a new example of a translation invariant measure with a rich domain and range that is not Hausdorff, a problem previously studied by Hirst.
  Although the constructed measure may exist in the literature, we were unable to locate any references to it.</description>

      <title>The rational rank of the support of generalized power series solutions of differential and $q$-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a differential or $q$-difference equation $P$ of order $n$, we prove that the set of exponents of a generalized power series solution has its rational rank bounded by the rational rank of the support of $P$ plus $n$. We also prove that when the support of the solution has maximum rational rank, it is convergent. Using the Newton polygon technique, we show also that in the maximum rational rank case, an initial segment can always be completed to a true solution. The techniques are the same for the differential and the $q$-difference case.</description>

      <title>Weighted Fourier inequalities and application of restriction theorems on rank one Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores weighted $(L^p, L^q)$ inequalities for the Fourier transform in rank one Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for these inequalities to hold. To prove the weighted Fourier inequalities, we apply restriction theorems on symmetric spaces and utilize Calder{\'o}n's estimate for sublinear operators. While establishing the necessary conditions, we demonstrate that Harish-Chandra's elementary spherical functions play a crucial role in this setting. Furthermore, we apply our findings to derive Fourier inequalities with polynomial and exponential weights.</description>

      <title>Fast expansion into harmonics on the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise fast and provably accurate algorithms to transform between an $N\times N \times N$ Cartesian voxel representation of a three-dimensional function and its expansion into the ball harmonics, that is, the eigenbasis of the Dirichlet Laplacian on the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, our algorithms achieve relative $\ell^1$ - $\ell^\infty$ accuracy $\varepsilon$ in time $O(N^3 (\log N)^2 + N^3 |\log \varepsilon|^2)$, while their dense counterparts have time complexity $O(N^6)$. We illustrate our methods on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Inequalities involving a measure of Marcell\'{a}n class and zeros of corresponding orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ be a quasi-orthogonal polynomial of order 1 on the unit circle, obtained from an orthogonal polynomial $\Phi_n$ with measure $\mu$, which is in the Marcell\'{a}n class, if there exist another measure $\tilde{\mu}$ such that $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ is a monic orthogonal polynomial. This article aims to investigate various properties related to the Marcell\'{a}n class. At first, we study the behaviour of the zeros between $\Phi_n$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_n$. Along with numerical examples, we analyze the zeros of $\Phi_n$, its POPUC and the linear combination of the POPUC. Further, comparison of the norm inequalities among $\Phi_n$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ are obtained by involving their measures. This leads to the study of the Lubinsky type inequality between the measures $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$, without using the ordering relation between $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$. Additionally, similar type of inequalities for the kernel type polynomials related to $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Birkhoff-Kellogg type theorem for discontinuous operators with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of fixed point index theory for multi-valued maps, we provide an analogue of the classical Birkhoff--Kellogg Theorem in the context of discontinuous operators acting on affine wedges in Banach spaces. Our theory is fairly general and can be applied, for example, to eigenvalues and parameter problems for ordinary differential equations with discontinuities. We illustrate in details this fact for a class of second order boundary value problem with deviated arguments and discontinuous terms. In a specific example, we explicitly compute the terms that occur in our theory.</description>

      <title>Critical Graph of a Polynomial Quadratic Differential related to a Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with Cubic Oscillator : WKB Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a full description of the critical graph of the quadratic differential $\varpi_{a,\theta}$ defined on the Riemann sphere $\widehat{% %TCIMACRO{\U{2102} }% %BeginExpansion \mathbb{C} %EndExpansion }$ by $\varpi_{a,\theta}=-e^{2i\theta}\left( z-a\right) \left( z^{2}-1\right) dz^{2},$ where $\theta\in% %TCIMACRO{\U{211d} }% %BeginExpansion \mathbb{R} %EndExpansion ,$ and $a\in% %TCIMACRO{\U{2102} }% %BeginExpansion \mathbb{C} %EndExpansion .$. We prove that the existence and the number of short trajectories of $\varpi_{a,\theta}$ depend on the location of $a$ in certain curves defined on the complex plane as the level sets of some harmonic functions. More focus will be to the cases $\theta\in\left\{ 0,\pi/4\right\} .$ We investigate these classifications to study an inverse spectral problem related to the complex cubic oscillator for Schr\"{o}dinger equation.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new SoS hierarchy for a broad class of average-case problems. The new high-entropy steps (HES) SoS hierarchy certifies properties of input instances only over a certain family of well behaved distributions of possible solutions. This allows the hierarchy to circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure \cite[Lec.~1.2, Marley Paradigm]{barak2016proofs} by vastly reducing the set of solution concepts they need to be proven over.
  We evaluate the HES SoS hierarchy on a well-studied Gaussian process: the spherical spin-glass, which is a particular ensemble of random low-degree polynomials (LDPs). We prove that, given an instance sampled from the problem distribution, with high probability there exists a HES distribution that achieves value arbitrarily close to the conjectured optimal algorithmic threshold and, at the same time, there are low-degree SoS certificates that no HES distribution can achieve value above a constant factor times this threshold, improving over standard SoS whose certificates are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$ for a degree-$p$ random polynomial \cite{bhattiprolu2017sum, hopkins2017power}. We also give examples of anisotropic modifications to the spherical spin glass problem where there is proof (or strong evidence) that the HES SoS hierarchy does better than the only other known algorithm \cite{subag2021following}. We conjecture that the HES SoS hierarchy can be applied to any LDP approximate Gaussian process to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.
  The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Compact bilinear operators and paraproducts revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new proof of the compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols. By drawing an analogy to compact linear operators, we first explore further properties of compact bilinear operators on Banach spaces and present examples. We then prove compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols by combining one of the properties of compact bilinear operators thus obtained with vanishing Carleson measure estimates and interpolation of bilinear compactness.</description>
