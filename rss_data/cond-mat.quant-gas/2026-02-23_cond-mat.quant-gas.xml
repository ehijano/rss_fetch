      <title>Families of localized modes of Bose-Einstein condensates enabled by incommensurate optical lattice and photon-atom interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a one-dimensional optical cavity under the combined action of an external potential and atom-cavity coupling with mutually incommensurate periods. Such configuration enables the localization of matter waves even in the absence of two-body interactions. We study families of localized modes within the mean-field approximation for red and blue detunings from atomic and cavity resonances in relatively shallow quasiperiodic lattices, beyond the validity of the tight-binding approximation. The parameter regimes supporting localization of atomic wave packets are identified. The system exhibits two types of bistability manifested as distinct photon numbers under otherwise identical conditions. One type arises from the coexistence of multiple families of localized modes, typical of conservative nonlinear systems, while the other stems from the multivalued dependence of the families on system parameters, characteristic of systems exhibiting hysteresis. BEC in a cavity may also display pseudodegeneracy, understood as the existence of two distinct atomic-density distributions corresponding to the same atomic and photon numbers (although different chemical potentials). The stability of the localized modes is analyzed. It is shown that, owing to the strong impact of long-range interactions on stability, a two-localized-mode configuration can operate as an XOR logic gate.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Rydberg states with a liquid core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent approach that provides an explicit potential for a Rydberg electron whose ionic core consists of a polarizable medium, typically realized with superfluid droplets. The electron's motion remains separable in spherical coordinates, but the radial force exerted by the droplet breaks degeneracy of the angular momentum states non-perturbatively. The ensuing electron spectrum reveals intriguing properties dependent on droplet size and electron excitation. Deviations of the polarizable medium from the continuous spherical distribution can be taken into account as a perturbation of this redefined Rydberg dynamics. We discuss specific but paradigmatic examples for superfluid helium and also propose a way to probe droplet properties including its possible crystallized fraction through stimulated transitions of the Rydberg electron.</description>

      <title>On self-dualities for scalar $\phi^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar field theory is studied by constructing interacting saddle point expansions in the symmetric and broken phase, respectively. Focusing on analytically tractable saddle expansions, it is found that broken and symmetric phases are related by sign flip of the quartic coupling. Applications to dimensions $d&lt;4$ recover previous results for the phase diagram, whereas $d=4$ is possibly new.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through the long-range extended XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range (LR) interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, improving the achievable fidelity, mitigating its slow decline as compared with the nearest-neighbor setting, associated with increasing system-size. Our study identifies the LR regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Furthermore, we exhibit that the presence of LR interactions considerably reduces the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit.</description>
