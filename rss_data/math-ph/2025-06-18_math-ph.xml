      <title>Revised identification of strain gradient elastic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work reported in ``Granular micromechanics-based identification of isotropic strain gradient parameters for elastic geometrically nonlinear deformations" misidentified key terms in the grain-pair objective relative displacement when accounting for the second gradient of placement. In this paper, we correct that oversight by deriving a revised expression for the grain-pair objective relative displacement within the granular micromechanics framework. The amended terms, which resemble Christoffel symbols expressed in terms of strain gradients, modify the contributions of both the normal and tangential components to the strain energy and, consequently, alter the identified strain gradient elastic parameters. Importantly, the identification of the standard (first gradient) elastic tensor remains unchanged. This brief paper presents the corrected derivation, the resulting stiffness tensors for anisotropic strain gradient elasticity, and updated analytical expressions for the material parameters in both 2D and 3D isotropic settings.</description>

      <title>Floquet-like theory and gauge transformations for general smooth dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.</description>

      <title>"Fields" in classical and quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges posed by the development of field theories, both classical and quantum, force us to question their most basic and foundational ideas like the role and origin of space-time, the meaning of physical states, etc. Among them the notion of ``field'' itself is notoriously difficult to address. These notes aim to analyze such notion from the perspective offered by the groupoid description of quantum mechanics inspired by Schwinger's picture of quantum mechanics. Then, a natural interpretation of the notion of physical fields as functors among appropriate groupoids will emerge. The domain of a field in this new picture is a groupoid that describes ``test particles'', and its codomain is a groupoid that describes the intrinsic nature of the system being probed. Such a space of functors carries some natural structures, which are best described in a categorical language. Some illustrative examples will be presented that could help clarify the various abstract notions discussed in the text.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Diagram of the REM under independent spin-flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape of the Random Energy model (REM) integrated along trajectories of the simple random walk on the hypercube. We show that the quenched cumulant generating function of the time integral of the REM energy undergoes phase transitions in the large $N$ limit for trajectories of any time extent, and identify phases distinguished by the activity and value of the time integral. This is achieved by relating the dynamical behavior to the spectral properties of Hamiltonians associated with the Quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). Of independent interest are deterministic $ \ell^p $-properties of the resolvents of such Hamiltonians, which we establish.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ factorization does not hold for arbitrary multi-trace observables in random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider real tensors of order $D$, that is $D$-dimensional arrays of real numbers $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$, where each index $a^c$ can take $N$ values. The tensor entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ have no symmetry properties under permutations of the indices. The invariant polynomials built out of the tensor entries are called trace invariants.
  We prove that for a Gaussian random tensor with $D\ge 3$ indices (that is such that the entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ are independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables) the cumulant, or connected expectation, of a product of trace invariants is not always suppressed in scaling in $N$ with respect to the product of the expectations of the individual invariants. Said otherwise, not all the multi-trace expectations factor at large $N$ in terms of the single-trace ones and the Gaussian scaling is not subadditive on the connected components. This is in stark contrast to the $D=2$ case of random matrices in which the multi-trace expectations always factor at large $N$. The best one can do for $D\ge 3$ is to identify restricted families of invariants for which the large $N$ factorization holds and we check that this indeed happens when restricting to the family of melonic observables, the dominant family in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to measure theory, integration and function spaces, with all the needed preliminaries included, and with some applications included as well. We first discuss some basic motivations, coming from discrete probability, that we develop in detail, as a preliminary to general measure theory. Then we discuss measure theory, integration and function spaces, all developed in a standard way, and with emphasis on the explicit computation of various integrals. Finally, we come back to probability, discrete and continuous, with a more advanced discussion, of quantum flavor.</description>

      <title>Moment-enhanced shallow water equations for non-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shallow water equations often assume a constant velocity profile along the vertical axis. However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature.</description>

      <title>A micromorphic-based artificial diffusion method for stabilized finite element approximation of convection-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel artificial diffusion method to circumvent the instabilities associated with the standard finite element approximation of convection-diffusion equations. Motivated by the micromorphic approach, we introduce an auxiliary variable, which is related to the gradient of the field of interest, and which leads to a coupled problem. Conditions for well-posedness of the resulting formulation are established. We carry out a comprehensive numerical study to compare the proposed methodology against some well-established approaches in one- and two-dimensional settings. The proposed method outperforms established approaches in general in approximating accurately the solutions to pertinent and challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Coarse graining of stochastic differential equations: averaging and projection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coarse-graining methods for stochastic differential equations. In particular we consider averaging and a type of projection operator method, sometimes referred to as effective dynamic via conditional expectations. The projection method (PM) we consider is related to the ``mimicking marginals'' coarse graining approach proposed by Gy\"ongy. The first contribution of this paper is to provide further theoretical background for the PM and a rigorous link to the Gy\"ongy method. Moreover, we compare PM and averaging. While averaging applies to systems with time scale separation, the PM can in principle be applied irrespective of this. However it is often assumed that the two methods coincide in presence of scale separation. The second contribution of this paper is to make this statement precise, provide sufficient conditions under which these two methods coincide and then show -- via examples and counterexamples -- that this needs not be the case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>The Gardner equation and acoustic solitary waves in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated where it is assumed that the ions follow a Cairns distribution and the electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation with the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.</description>

Abstract: We relate graph complexes, Calabi-Yau $A_\infty$-categories and Kontsevich's cocycle construction. Our main result produces a commutative square of shifted Poisson algebras; one of its edges is the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan map, generalized to $A_\infty$-categories. We describe a quantized version via Beilinson-Drinfeld algebras. The larger context is to provide categorical methods which relate enumerative geometry (as in mirror symmetry) and large $N$ gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an elementary approach to observe frequency cascade on forced nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations. The forcing term consists of a constant term, perturbed by a modulated Gaussian well. Algebraic computations provide an explicit frequency cascade when time and space derivatives are discarded from the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We provide stability results, showing that when derivatives are incorporated in the model, the initial algebraic solution may be little affected, possibly over long time intervals. Numerical simulations are provided, which support the analysis.</description>

      <title>Vogel's universality and the classification problem for Jacobi identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a summary of discussions at the recent ITEP-JINR-YerPhI workshop on Vogel theory in Dubna. We consider relation between Vogel divisor(s) and the old Dynkin classification of simple Lie algebras. We consider application to knot theory and the hidden role of Jacobi identities in the definition/invariance of Kontsevich integral, which is the knot polynomial with the values in diagrams, capable of revealing all Vassiliev invariants -- including the ones, not visible in other approaches. Finally we comment on the possible breakdown of Vogel universality after the Jack/Macdonald deformation. Generalizations to affine, Yangian and DIM algebras are also mentioned. Especially interesting could be the search for universality in ordinary Yang-Mills theory and its interference with confinement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Eigenfunctions and Matrix Lyapunov Equations from Energy Balance Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified theoretical framework that connects classical orthogonal polynomial systems to matrix Lyapunov equations through the fundamental physics of energy dissipation in stochastic dynamical systems. Starting from the energy balance principle in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we derive a master integral representation that naturally encompasses both spectral geometry and covariance dynamics. The theory reveals that established orthogonal polynomials (Zernike, Hermite, spherical harmonics) and matrix Lyapunov equations are dual manifestations of the same underlying energy dissipation structure. We provide rigorous mathematical foundations showing how finite-dimensional projections of infinite-dimensional energy integrals reproduce classical matrix equations, with specific structure determined by the symmetries of noise processes. The framework demonstrates that adding uniform dissipation to classical differential operators preserves their polynomial eigenfunction structure while ensuring the energy balance conditions required for physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Enstrophy dynamics for flow past a solid body with no-slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper we study the impact of the boundary vorticity distribution on the dynamics of enstrophy for flows around streamlined body. A new energy identity is derived in the article, which includes the boundary values of the vortex function. For the Stokes system the dissipativity of enstrophy is proved. For the Navier-Stokes system a new equation of the enstrophy dynamics is obtained.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation with shear deformations in the hyperbolic-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a particular class of solutions of the Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation, known in the nonlinear setting as homoenergetic solutions, which have the form $g\left( x,v,t \right) =f\left( v-L\left( t\right)x,t\right)$ where the matrix $L(t)$ describes a shear flow deformation. We began this analysis in [22] where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established the different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0\leq \gamma &lt;1$, including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In this paper, we concentrate in the case where the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This occurs for collision kernels with $\gamma &lt; 0$ and in particular we focus on $\gamma \in (-1,0)$. In such a hyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear description of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the long-time asymptotics for the distribution of velocities and provide the explicit form for the asymptotic profile. Additionally, we discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $\gamma &lt; -1$. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation describing a stochastic process consisting in a combination of collisions and shear flows. The tagged particle velocity $\{v(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a Markov process that arises from the combination of free flights in a shear flow along with random jumps caused by collisions.</description>

      <title>On extinction and survival of the Bak-Sneppen model on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete Bak-Sneppen model introduced by Barbay and Kenyon (2001) "On the discrete Bak-Sneppen model of self-organized criticality". We extend their results as well as the non-triviality result of Meester and Znamenskiy (2002) for a finite segment of $\mathbb{Z}^1$ with the periodic boundary condition to a large class of graphs, by using coupling between the Bak-Sneppen model and the oriented percolation in a quadrant. This allows us to avoid dealing with the so-called avalanches, thus simplifying many arguments.</description>

      <title>Randomised composite linear-combination-of-unitaries: its role in quantum simulation and observable estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking: a view from derived geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine symmetry breaking in field theory within the framework of derived geometry, as applied to field theory via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Our emphasis is on the standard examples of Ginzburg-Landau and Yang-Mills-Higgs theories and is primarily interpretive. The rich, sophisticated language of derived geometry captures the physical story elegantly, allowing for sharp formulations of slogans (e.g., for the Higgs mechanism, that the unstable ghosts eat the Goldstone modes). Rewriting these results in the BV formalism provides, as one nice payoff, a reformulation of 't Hooft's family of gauge-fixing conditions for spontaneously broken gauge theory that behaves well in the $\xi \to \infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Truncated quantum observables and their semiclassical limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically allowed region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically allowed region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A limiting case is considered in which the causal action principle for causal fermion systems describing Minkowski space gives rise to the linear Fock space dynamics of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum nature of the bosonic field is a consequence of the stochastic description of a multitude of fluctuating fields coupled to non-commuting operators, taking into account dephasing effects. The scaling of all error terms is specified. Our analysis leads to the concept of holographic mixing, which is introduced and explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for the complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz-covariant bilinear form as Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

Abstract: In a configuration space whose boundary can be identified with a subset of its interior, a boundary condition can relate the behaviour of a function on the boundary and in the interior. Additionally, boundary values can appear as additive perturbations. Such boundary conditions have recently provided insight into problems form quantum field theory. We discuss interior-boundary conditions in an abstract setting, with a focus on self-adjoint operators, proving self-adjointness criteria, resolvent formulas, and a classification theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09275v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the perturbed Stark operator $H_q\varphi = -\varphi" + x\varphi + q(x)\varphi$, $\varphi(0)=0$, in $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, where $q$ is a real-valued function that belongs to $\mathfrak{A}_r =\left\{ q\in\mathcal{A}_r\cap\text{AC}[0,\infty) : q'\in\mathcal{A}_r\right\}$, where $\mathcal{A}_r = L^2(\mathbb{R}_+,(1+x)^r dx)$ and $r&gt;1$ is arbitrary but fixed. Let $\left\{\lambda_n(q)\right\}_{n=1}^ \infty$ and $\left\{\kappa_n(q)\right\}_{n=1}^ \infty$ be the spectrum and associated set of norming constants of $H_q$. Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be the zeros of the Airy function of the first kind, and let $\omega_r:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ be defined by the rule $\omega_r(n) = n^{-1/3}\log^{1/2}n$ if $r\in(1,2)$ and $\omega_r(n) = n^{-1/3}$ if $r\in[2,\infty)$. We prove that $\lambda_n(q) = -a_n + \pi (-a_n)^{-1/2}\int_0^\infty \text{Ai}^2(x+a_n)q(x)dx + O(n^{-1/3}\omega_r^2(n))$ and $\kappa_n(q) = - 2\pi (-a_n)^{-1/2}\int_0^\infty \text{Ai}(x+a_n)\text{Ai}'(x+a_n)q(x)dx + O(\omega_r^3(n))$, uniformly on bounded subsets of $\mathfrak{A}_r$. In order to obtain these asymptotic formulas, we first show that $\lambda_n:\mathcal{A}_r\to\mathbb{R}$ and $\kappa_n:\mathcal{A}_r\to\mathbb{R}$ are real analytic maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general initial data for the Einstein scalar-field system on a closed $3$-manifold $(M,\gamma)$ which is close to data for a Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker solution with homogeneous scalar field matter and a negative Einstein metric $\gamma$ as spatial geometry. We prove that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of such initial data in the Einstein scalar-field system is past incomplete in the contracting direction and exhibits stable collapse into a Big Bang curvature singularity. Under an additional condition on the first positive eigenvalue of $-\Delta_\gamma$ satisfied, for example, by closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds of small diameter, we prove that the data evolves to a future complete spacetime in the expanding direction which asymptotes to a vacuum Friedman solution with $(M,\gamma)$ as the expansion normalized spatial geometry. In particular, the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for this class of solutions in the $C^{2}$-sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nulls are locations where the magnetic field vanishes. Nulls are the location of magnetic reconnection, and they determine to a large degree the magnetic connectivity in a system. We describe a novel approach to understanding movement, appearance, and disappearance of nulls in magnetic fields. This approach is based on the concept of isotropes, or lines where the field direction is constant. These lines are streamlines of a vector field whose flux is sourced by the topological indices of nulls, and can be conceptualized as corresponding "lines of force" between nulls. We show how this topological approach can be used to generate analytical expressions for the location of nulls in the presence of external fields for dipoles and for a field defined by the Hopf fibration.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <title>Why is the universe not frozen by the quantum Zeno effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build a discrete model that simulates the ubiquitous competition between the free internal evolution of a two-level system and the decoherence induced by the interaction with its surrounding environment. It is aimed at being as universal as possible, so that no specific Hamiltonian is assumed. This leads to an analytic criterion, depending on the level of short time decoherence, allowing to determine whether the system will freeze due to the Zeno effect. We check this criterion on several classes of functions which correspond to different physical situations. In the most generic case, the free evolution wins over decoherence, thereby explaining why the universe is indeed not frozen. We finally make a quantitative comparison with the continuous model of Presilla, Onofrio and Tambini, based on a Lindblad's master equation, a find good agreement at least in the low coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (Adv.Oper.Theory, 5, 901, 2020, Adv.Oper.Theory, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous quantization of the Yang-Mills gradient flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new off-shell formulation for six-dimensional conformal supergravity obtained by gauging the 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal algebra in superspace. We provide the complete gauged algebra, which proves to be considerably constrained compared to other conformal superspaces constructed in the past. This formulation is employed to obtain the unique 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ Bach tensor superfield, which describes the multiplet of equations of motions for conformal supergravity, by using a general ansatz fixed by truncation to 6D $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ results. We also translate some results into components for precise matching against the literature.</description>

      <title>Dense Phenomena for Ergodic Schr\"odinger Operators: I. Spectrum, Integrated Density of States, and Lyapunov Exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators in $\ell^2(\Z)$ whose potentials are defined via continuous sampling along the orbits of a homeomorphism on a compact metric space. We show that for each non-atomic ergodic measure $\mu$, there is a dense set of sampling functions such that the associated almost sure spectrum has finitely many gaps, the integrated density of states is smooth, and the Lyapunov exponent is smooth and positive. As a byproduct we answer a question of Walters about the existence of non-uniform $\SL(2,\R)$ cocycles in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>
