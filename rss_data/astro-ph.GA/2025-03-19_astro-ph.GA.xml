      <title>Evolution of Massive Red Galaxies in Clusters from z=1.0 to z=0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical issue in studying the evolution of galaxy clusters is to find ways that enable meaningful comparisons of clusters observed at different redshifts, as well as in various stages of their growth. Studies in the past have typically suffered from uncertainties in cluster mass estimates due to the scatter between cluster observables and mass. Here we propose a novel and general approach that uses the probability distribution function of an observable-cluster mass relation, together with dark matter halo merger trees extracted from numerical simulations, such that one can trace the evolution in a self-contained fashion, for clusters chosen to lie in a specified range in mass and redshift. This method, when applied to clusters of different mass ranges, further allows one to examine the evolution of various observable-cluster mass scaling relations. We illustrate the potential of this method by studying the stellar mass content of red cluster member galaxies, as well as the growth of brightest cluster galaxies, from z=1.0 to z=0.3, using a large optically-detected cluster sample from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey, finding good agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Is there a tilt in the fundamental (hyper)plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental plane (FP) of selected early-type (ETG) member galaxies of the galaxy cluster PLCK G287.0+32.9 ($ z_c = 0.3833 $), exploring also four-dimensional hyperplane extensions. We measure ETGs structural parameters and photometry from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We use high-quality spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to measure the galaxy central stellar velocity dispersions and stellar population properties. With this data, we construct the FP through a robust fitting procedure and analyze its tilt and scatter. We then introduce two hyperplane extensions, one including the stellar mass ($M^\star$-HP) and another including the stellar over total mass fraction ($f_{\mathrm{e}}^\star$-HP), and compare their coefficients and scatter to those of the FP. The FP of PLCK G287.0+32.9 is found to have best-fit parameter values consistent with those in the literature ($\alpha = 1.2 \pm 0.1$ and $\beta = -0.75 \pm 0.05$), with a scatter of $0.09$ dex. The ($f_{\mathrm{e}}^\star$-HP) shows no tilt compared to the theoretical plane ($\alpha = 2.1 \pm 0.2$ and $\beta = -1.12 \pm 0.07$), with a scatter of $0.042$ dex, and the ($M^\star$-HP) reveals an even tighter relation, with a scatter of only $0.023$. Our findings support the idea that the FP is a lower-dimensional projection of a more complex hyperplane and confirm that the variations in the dark matter content contribute significantly to the tilt of the FP. Future studies incorporating larger samples of galaxies and additional physical parameters may further refine our understanding of the FP and its higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Central galaxy alignments. Dependence on the mass and the large-scale environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that central galaxies show a significant alignment of their main shape axes with other galaxies in their group, as well as with the large-scale structure of the universe. Simulations have corroborated this finding, providing further insights into how the shape of the stellar component aligns with the surrounding dark matter halo. Recent studies have also investigated the evolution of this alignment in bright central galaxies, revealing that the shapes of the dark matter halo and the stellar component can differ. In this work, we aim at gaining a deeper understanding of galaxy alignments by quantifying how this property is related to the mass of the haloes hosting central galaxies and to the large-scale environment measured at different scales. By studying different angles, we describe how the alignments of central galaxies depend on the mass of the haloes they inhabit. We explore how the main axes of central galaxies align across different scales, both in three-dimensional and two-dimensional projections. We examine how halo mass influences these alignments and how they vary in the surrounding large-scale environment. To conduct this study, we employ the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations and compare our results with the spectroscopic data from the SDSS DR18. Three types of alignment were analysed: between stellar and dark matter components, between satellite galaxies and the central galaxy, and between the central galaxy and its host halo. The results show that the alignment increases with halo mass and varies with the environment (clusters, filaments, cluster periphery, and others). However, after controlling for local density, we found that most of the observed trends disappear. The SDSS observations confirm a mass dependence similar to the simulations, although observational biases limit the detection of differences between the different environments.</description>

      <title>Compact groups from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation -- VI: Evolution of the two first-ranked galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies have proven to be unique environments for studying galaxy interactions. We propose a detailed analysis of the galaxy evolution to disentangle the relationship between the two first-ranked galaxies in CGs throughout their history as a function of the assembly channels of their hosts. Our study was performed from a semi-analytical point of view, using more than 20000 CGs. We based our analysis on studying the first- (1R) and second-ranked (2R) galaxies in CGs, where the ranking is determined using the galaxy stellar mass. The 1R galaxies have significantly reduced their star-forming capacity over time, reaching a quenching stage and often becoming bulge-dominated or elliptical. Notably, this transformation occurred earlier for 1R galaxies in early-formed CGs (around 5 to 8 Gyrs ago), while those in recently-formed CGs experienced this change more recently (around 2 to 3 Gyrs ago). The analysis of the time evolution of a variant of the Tremaine &amp; Richstone statistics showed that the 1R galaxy in early-formed CGs began to stand out for its dominant properties around 6 Gyrs ago, almost 5 Gyrs earlier than the 1R inhabiting recently formed CGs. We observed that a large majority of the 1R galaxies have experienced at least one major merger event during their life, while we observed this only for a third of 2R galaxies. The 1R galaxies can also display several of these events and most of their last major merger events can be described as the addition of a progenitor that is the second most massive galaxy in their surroundings at the time of the merger. We find that the semi-analytical framework explored in this work describes a scenario where galaxy mergers are the main driving force in shaping the properties of the 1R galaxies in CGs. We note that this scenario is especially intensive when those galaxies inhabit CGs that had formed early on.</description>

      <title>CoCCoA: Complex Chemistry in hot Cores with ALMA. The chemical evolution of acetone from ice to gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acetone (CH3COCH3) is one of the most abundant three-carbon oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (O-COMs) that have been detected in space. Recently, acetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which enables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone ice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is currently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone gas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the chemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit the ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and line width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and propyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that the observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those of two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other O-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific formation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers, esters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest that acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other O-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The acetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of magnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are several suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6). The observed ratios between acetone and the relevant species are rather constant across the sample, and can be well reproduced by astrochemical simulations, but more investigations are needed to draw solid conclusions.</description>

      <title>UNIONS: The Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) is a "collaboration of collaborations" that is using the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope, the Pan-STARRS telescopes, and the Subaru Observatory to obtain $ugriz$ images of a core survey region of 6250 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. The $10\sigma$ point source depth of the data, as measured within a 2-arcsecond diameter aperture, are $[u,g,r,i,z] = [23.7, 24.5, 24.2, 23.8, 23.3]$\ in AB magnitudes. UNIONS is addressing some of the most fundamental questions in astronomy, including the properties of dark matter, the growth of structure in the Universe from the very smallest galaxies to large-scale structure, and the assembly of the Milky Way. It is set to become the major ground-based legacy survey for the northern hemisphere for the next decade and provides an essential northern complement to the static-sky science of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. UNIONS supports the core science mission of the {\it Euclid} space mission by providing the data necessary in the northern hemisphere for the calibration of the wavelength dependence of the {\it Euclid} point-spread function and derivation of photometric redshifts in the North Galactic Cap. This region contains the highest quality sky for {\it Euclid}, with low backgrounds from the zodiacal light, stellar density, extinction, and emission from Galactic cirrus. Here, we describe the UNIONS survey components, science goals, data products, and the current status of the overall program.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of new primordial open cluster groups: Feedback-driven star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of open cluster (OCs) groups remain unclear due to limited sample sizes and data precision. Recent advancements in Gaia astrometric data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study OC groups in greater detail. This study aims to extend the sample of OC groups and investigate their formation and evolution mechanisms, with a focus on the role of stellar feedback in triggering star formation. We identify four new OC groups based on Gaia data, whose member OCs are spatially proximate and kinematically coherent. Their age spreads are consistent with the timescale of continuous star formation, suggesting that their member OCs formed sequentially from the same molecular cloud. N-body simulation results further reveal that these groups will gradually disperse, evolving into independent OCs. By analyzing the correlation between OC ages and their separation from potential SN explosion sites, we predict SN explosion regions around the birthplaces of OC groups. The strong correlation between OC ages and predicted SN explosion sites supports a supernova-triggered star formation scenario. Additionally, we trace pulsar (PSR) orbits to examine their association with these regions. We detected three PSRs near Group 1 and 26 PSRs near Group 2, whose birthplaces align with the predicted SN explosions regions. The presence of PSRs associated with OC groups provides additional observational evidence for SN explosions in this region, further supporting a supernova-triggered star formation scenario for G1 and G2. We propose that multiple SN explosions in a short period triggered the formation of Group 1 and Group 2, reinforcing the hierarchical star formation model. These results highlight the multi-scale interactions driving star and OC formation and provide new insights into the role of stellar feedback in shaping OC groups.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101: From Shock Breakout to the Nebular Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023ixf covering from day one to 442 days after explosion. SN 2023ixf reached a peak $V$-band absolute magnitude of $-18.2 \pm 0.07$, and light curves show that it is in the fast-decliner (IIL) subclass with a relatively short ``plateau'' phase (fewer than $\sim 70$ days). Early-time spectra of SN 2023ixf exhibit strong, very narrow emission lines from ionized circumstellar matter (CSM), possibly indicating a Type IIn classification. But these flash/shock-ionization emission features faded after the first week and the spectrum evolved in a manner similar to that of typical Type II SNe, unlike the case of most genuine SNe~IIn in which the ejecta interact with CSM for an extended period of time and develop intermediate-width emission lines. We compare observed spectra of SN 2023ixf with various model spectra to understand the physics behind SN 2023ixf. Our nebular spectra (between 200-400 d) match best with the model spectra from a 15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ progenitor which experienced enhanced mass loss a few years before explosion. A last-stage mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 0.01 \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ from the r1w6 model matches best with the early-time spectra, higher than $\dot{M} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-3} \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ derived from the ionized H${\alpha}$ luminosity at 1.58 d. We also use SN 2023ixf as a distance indicator and fit the light curves to derive the Hubble constant by adding SN 2023ixf to the existing sample; we obtain H$_{0}=73.1^{+3.68}_{-3.50}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with the results from SNe~Ia and many other independent methods.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dust Attenuation at Kiloparsec Scales. II. Attenuation Curves from Near-Ultraviolet to Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series that utilize IFS from MaNGA, NUV imaging from Swift/UVOT and NIR imaging from 2MASS to study dust attenuation properties on kpc scales in nearby galaxies. We apply the method developed in Paper I (Zhou et al. 2023) to the updated SWiM_v4.2 catalog, and measure the optical attenuation curve and the attenuation in three NUV bands for 2487 spaxels selected from 91 galaxies with S/N&gt;20 and $A_V$&gt;0.25. We classify all spaxels into two subsets: star-forming (SF) regions and non-SF regions. We explore the correlations of optical opacity ($A_V$) and the optical and NUV slopes of attenuation curves ($A_B/A_V$ and $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$) with a broad range of stellar and emission-line properties, including specific surface brightness of H$\alpha$ emission, stellar age, stellar and gas-phase metallicity, and diagnostics of recent star formation history. When comparing SF and non-SF regions, we find that $A_V$ and $A_B/A_V$ exhibit similar correlations with all the stellar population and emission-line properties considered, while the NUV slopes in SF regions tend to be flatter than those in non-SF regions. The NUV slope $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ exhibits an anti-correlation with specific surface brightness of H$\alpha$ emission, a trend that is primarily driven by the positive correlation between $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ and $\Sigma_\ast$. The NUV slope flattens in SF regions that contain young stellar populations and have experienced recent star formation, but it shows no obvious dependence on stellar or gas-phase metallicity. The spatially resolved dust attenuation properties exhibit no clear correlations with the inclination of host galaxies or the galactocentric distance of the regions. This finding reinforces the conclusion from Paper I that dust attenuation is primarily regulated by local processes on kpc scales or smaller, rather than by global processes at galactic scales.</description>

      <title>The CatSouth Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Southern Sky and a Unified All-Sky Catalog Based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Giant Molecular Cloud at the Midpoint of the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes: M4.7-0.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of a previously unknown giant molecular cloud (GMC) located at the midpoint of the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes (M4.7--0.8), using spectral line observations taken with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This $\sim$60 pc long GMC is associated with accreting material that is transitioning from the quieter Galactic disk environment to the more extreme central molecular zone (CMZ) environment. Our 24 GHz single-dish radio observations targeted the NH$_3$ (1,1)$-$(4,4) and HC$_5$N (9$-$8), known dense gas tracers. The observations reveal the main features of the GMC, which we have dubbed the `Nexus' and `Filament', covering a 0$.\!\!^\circ$5$\times$0$.\!\!^\circ$25 area at 31$''$ angular resolution. In this publication we investigate the gas kinematics within the observed region and compare the distribution of molecular emission to previous infrared surveys to better understand the dust component. The observed gas tracers show centrally condensed cores corresponding to the positions of high dust column densities and low dust temperatures. We report the detection of a previously unknown NH$_3$ (3,3) maser, along with a 70$\mu$m source association, which supports the identification of this region as being actively star-forming. Gas emission in this region shows broad linewidths, comparable to values seen in CMZ clouds. The overall description of this cloud that we present is that of a highly dynamic region comprising dense gas and dust. This encapsulates a wide range of features associated with star formation, in addition to material transport related to the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Revisiting physical properties of mock globular cluster tidal tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present results of the first in-depth analysis of extra-tidal mock stars of Milky Way globular clusters recently generated by Grondin et al. (2024). Particularly, we selected a sample of globular clusters with a general consensus of being formed in the bulge or in the disk of the Milky Way. From the catalog we estimated the width and the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum and in the line-of-sight and tangential velocities of their tidal tails, and compared the results with those predicted by cosmological simulations of Malhan et al. (2021) and observations. We found that the resulting values of these four quantities are not in agreement with an in-situ formation of the associated globular clusters. On average, the resulting widths agree with an in-situ origin, while the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum, and the dispersion in the line-of-sight and in the tangential velocities fail in matching this formation scenario. The four quantities derived for globular clusters formed in the bulge or in the disk show similar correlations with the stream length, namely: the width and the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum increase with the stream length, while the bulk of dispersion values in the line-of-sight and in the tangential velocities is around 12 km s$^{\rm -1}$ along the mock stream.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the early Universe star formation efficiency from galaxy clustering and halo modeling of H$\alpha$ and [O III] emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to provide observational constraints on the early Universe galaxy-halo connection by combining measurements of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) and galaxy clustering via the 2-point correlation function (2PCF). We implemented this framework in the FRESCO and CONGRESS JWST NIRCam/grism surveys by measuring the 2PCF of spectroscopically selected samples of H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters at $3.8&lt;z&lt;9$ in 124 arcmin$^2$ in GOODS-N and GOODS-S. By fitting the 2PCF and UVLF at $3.8&lt;z&lt;9$ we inferred that the H$\alpha$ and [OIII] samples at $\langle z \rangle \sim4.3, 5.4$ and $7.3$ reside in halos of masses of log$(M_{\rm h}/$M$_{\odot}) = 11.5$, $11.2$, $11.0$ respectively, while their galaxy bias increases with redshift with values of $b_{\rm g} = 4.0$, $5.0$, $7.6$. These halos do not represent extreme overdense environments at these epochs. We constrain the instantaneous star formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the ratio of the star formation rate over the baryonic accretion rate as a function of halo mass. The SFE rises with halo mass, peaks at $\sim20\%$ at $M_{\rm h} \sim 3 \times 10^{11}\, M_{\odot}$, and declines at higher halo masses. The SFE-$M_{\rm h}$ shows only a mild evolution with redshift with tentative indications that low mass halos decrease but the high mass halos increase in efficiency with redshift. The scatter in the $M_{\rm UV}-M_{\rm h}$ relation, quantified by $\sigma_{\rm UV}$, implies stochasticity in the UV luminosities of $\sim 0.7$ mag, relatively constant with z. Extrapolating our model to $z&gt;9$ shows that a constant SFE-$M_{\rm h}$ fixed at $z=8$ cannot reproduce the observed UVLF and neither high maximum SFE nor high stochasticity alone can explain the high abundances of luminous galaxies seen by JWST. Extending the analysis of the UVLF and 2PCF to $z&gt;9$ measured from wider surveys will be crucial in breaking degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The H$\alpha$ sky in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine parallax distances to nearby O stars with parsec-scale resolution three-dimensional dust maps of the local region of the Milky Way (within 1.25 kpc of the Sun) to simulate the transfer of Lyman continuum photons through the interstellar medium. Assuming a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we determine the density of ionized gas, electron temperature, and H$\alpha$ emissivity throughout the local Milky Way. There is good morphological agreement between the predicted and observed H$\alpha$ all-sky map of the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper. We find that our simulation underproduces the observed H$\alpha$ emission while overestimating the sizes of HII regions, and we discuss ways in which agreement between simulations and observations may be improved. Of the total ionizing luminosity of $5.84 \times 10^{50}~{\rm photons~s^{-1}}$, 15% is absorbed by dust, 64% ionizes "classical'' HII regions, 11% ionizes the diffuse warm ionized medium, and 10% escapes the simulation volume. We find that 18% of the high altitude ($|b| &gt; 30^{\circ}$) H$\alpha$ arises from dust-scattered rather than direct emission. These initial results provide an impressive validation of the three-dimensional dust maps and O-star parallaxes, opening a new frontier for studying the ionized ISM's structure and energetics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Distance to the Magellanic Stream: Constraints from Optical Absorption along Stellar Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a large tail of neutral and ionized gas originating from tidal and hydrodynamical interactions between the Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way (MW). It carries a significant gas reservoir that could impact the future evolution of the MW. Despite its importance, no direct observational constraints on the Stream's distance have been previously published. In this study, we analyze Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (VLT/UVES) spectra of five blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the MW halo located at distances ranging from 13 to 56 kpc near two regions of the Stream, with the aim of detecting Ca II and Na I absorption. No Ca II or Na I absorption is detected at Stream velocities in any of the individual spectra, or in higher signal-to-noise stacks of the spectra. The resulting limits on the Ca II absorption are significantly lower than the Ca II columns measured in the Stream along extragalactic directions. These non-detections establish a firm lower distance limit of 20 kpc for the two regions of the Stream studied. Ca II non-detections in the most distant stars yield tentative lower distance limits of 42 kpc and 55 kpc for the two regions, but deeper spectra are needed to confirm this. Our results provide the first observational constraints on the gaseous Stream's distance.</description>

      <title>Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). I. Ordered massive star formation in the outer Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim11\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.</description>

      <title>Global survey of star clusters in the Milky Way VIII. Cluster formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tidal masses and ages of Milky Way open clusters, as well as a simple model of their distribution. Our aim is to investigate the space of model parameters and the correspondence between modelled and observed two-dimensional cluster age-mass distributions. The model for cluster evolution is comprised of a two-section cluster initial mass function, constant cluster formation rate, and a mass loss function. This mass loss function represents a supervirial phase after gas expulsion, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and gradual dissolution driven by internal dynamics and the Galactic tidal field. We construct different estimators of model fitness based on $\chi^2$-statistics, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and a maximum-likelihood approach. Using these estimators and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we obtain best-fit values and posterior distributions for a selection of model parameters. The KLD returns a superior model compared to the other statistics. The cluster initial mass function is well constrained and we find a clear signature of an enhanced cluster mass loss in the first 50 Myr. In the KLD best model, clusters lose 72% of their initial mass in the violent relaxation phase, after which cluster mass loss slows down, allowing for a relatively low rate of cluster formation of $0.088\mathrm{M_\odot kpc^{-2} Gyr^{-1}}$. The observed upper limit of cluster ages at approx. 5 Gyr is reflected in the model by a shallow lifetime-mass relation for clusters with initial masses above $1000\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The application of the model to an independent cluster sample based on Gaia DR3 data yields similar results except for a systematic shift in age. The observed cluster age-mass distribution is compatible with a constant cluster formation rate. The enhanced number of young massive clusters observed requires an early violent relaxation phase of strong mass loss.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure Correlations between the Nebular, Molecular, and Atmospheric Gases in the Cores of Four Cool Core Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity structure of nebular gas in the central galaxies of four clusters: Abell 1835, PKS 0745-191, Abell 262, and RXJ0820.9+0752, using data from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the [OII] emission line are compared to VSFs of molecular clouds observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Apart from Abell 262 where the gas is located in a circumnuclear disk, the nebular gas in the remaining galaxies lies in off-nuclear filamentary structures with VSFs steeper than the Kolmogorov slope. This steepening may be plausibly attributed to gravity although other factors, such as magnetic stresses and bulk motion,} may be significant. The VSFs of CO and [OII] emission are similar in RXJ0820 and Abell 262, indicating close coupling of the nebular and molecular gases. In contrast, the nebular and molecular gases are differentiated on most scales in PKS 0745 and Abell 1835. This discrepancy is likely due to the radio-AGN churning the gas. We compare the scale-dependent velocity amplitudes of the hot atmospheres constrained by X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis using Chandra observations to the nebular VSFs. The large-scale consistency in Abell 1835 and RXJ0820 is consistent with condensation from the hot atmospheres. {We explore substantial systematic biases, including projection effects, windowing, and smoothing effects when comparing VSFs using different telescopes and instruments.</description>

Abstract: Redshift-independent distances underpin much of astrophysics, and there exists a plethora of methods to estimate them. However, the extent to which the distances they imply are consistent, while crucial for the integrity of the distance ladder, has been little explored. We construct a statistical framework to assess both internal (between measurements with the same method) and external (between-method) consistency by comparing differences between distances to their quoted statistical uncertainties in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Distances (NED-D). 66 of the 76 indicators in NED-D are amenable to a consistency test by having at least two measurements to the same galaxy or at least one measurement to a galaxy also measured by another method. We find that only 12 of these methods produce self-consistent distances across literature determinations, of which 7 are also consistent with distances to the same galaxies measured by all other methods. The most consistent 6 methods (M-stars luminosity, Novae, Masers, Globular Cluster Fundamental Plane, O- and B-type Supergiants and BL Lac Luminosity) also give similar average distances to the mean of all indicators, while the 7th (Proper Motion) underestimates distances relative to the mean by 17.1%. We also investigate consistency of Cepheid distances in the SH0ES 2022 catalogue, finding no evidence for unaccounted-for systematics. Our NED-D results imply that considerable work remains to obtain reliable distances by a multitude of methods, a crucial endeavour for constructing a multiply cross checked and fully robust distance ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is a crucial tool for understanding the mechanisms driving flux changes. In this study, we present an infrared variability analysis of a large sample of over 20,000 candidate YSOs, using data from the ALLWISE and NEOWISE surveys, which span around a decade with a 6-month cadence. We applied Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) analysis and linear fitting to the light curves, classifying them into distinct categories: {\it Secular} ({\it Linear}, {\it Curved}, and {\it Periodic}) and {\it Stochastic} ({\it Burst}, {\it Drop}, and {\it Irregular}). Our findings show that 5,467 (26.2$\pm$0.3\%) of the sources exhibit variability, with most (19.7$\pm$0.3\%) showing {\it Irregular} variations, followed by {\it Curved} and {\it Periodic} variations. In addition, 235 sources of {\it Bursts} and 122 {\it Drop} sources were identified. Variability is more pronounced in Class I sources with a higher fraction of variables (36.3$\pm$0.6\%) compared to Class II (22.1$\pm$0.4\%) and Class III (22.5$\pm$1.0\%) sources. The color (W1 $-$ W2) versus magnitude analysis (W2) using linear fitting shows that the trend ``redder-when-brighter" (RWB) is more prevalent (85.4$\pm$0.5\%) among YSOs. In contrast, the trend ``bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) is more common in younger sources compared to more evolved ones, having a BWB fraction of 29.0$\pm$1.1\% for Class I to 4.0$\pm$0.9\% for Class III.</description>

      <title>A new method to retrieve the star formation history from white dwarf luminosity functions -- an application to the Gaia catalogue of nearby stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the state-of-the-art Gaia astrometry, the number of confirmed white dwarfs has reached a few hundred thousand. We have reached the era where small features in the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the solar neighbourhood can be resolved. We demonstrate how to apply Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a set of pre-computed partial-WDLFs to derive the star formation history of their progenitor stellar populations. We compare the results against many well-accepted and established works using various types of stars, including white dwarfs, main sequence stars, sub-giants and the entire stellar population. We find convincing agreements among most of the methods, particularly at the intermediate age of 0.1-9 Gyr.</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XV: The physical properties of super-massive black holes and their impact on galaxies in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to $M_{\bullet}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ($5\le\, z \le10$). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range $z=5\to 10$. Comparison between our predicted bolometric luminosity function and pre-\emph{JWST} observations yield a good match. However, recent \emph{JWST} observations appear to suggest a larger contribution of SMBHs than previously observed, or predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at $z&gt;5$, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.</description>

      <title>A Local Dwarf Galaxy Search Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning search for local, low-mass galaxies ($z &lt; 0.02$ and $10^6 M_\odot &lt; M_* &lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) using the combined photometric data from the DESI Imaging Legacy Surveys and the WISE survey. We introduce the spectrally confirmed training sample, discuss evaluation metrics, investigate the features, compare different machine learning algorithms, and find that a 7-class neural network classification model is highly effective in separating the signal (local, low-mass galaxies) from various contaminants, reaching a precision of $95\%$ and a recall of $76\%$. The principal contaminants are nearby sub-$L^*$ galaxies at $0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$ and nearby massive galaxies at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.2$. We find that the features encoding surface brightness information are essential to achieving a correct classification. Our final catalog, which we make available, consists of 112,859 local, low-mass galaxy candidates, where 36,408 have high probability ($p_{\rm signal} &gt; 0.95$), covering the entire Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint. Using DESI-EDR public spectra and data from the SAGA and ELVES surveys, we find that our model has a precision of $\sim 100\%$, $96\%$, and $97\%$, respectively, and a recall of $\sim 51\%$, $68\%$ and $53\%$, respectively. The results of those independent spectral verification demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our machine learning classification model.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background on Circumgalactic Medium Absorption Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the many different pieces of physics that go into simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) plays a significant role in determining the ionization state of different metal species. However, the UVB is uncertain with multiple models having been developed by various research groups over the past several decades. In this work, we examine how different UVB models influence the ionic column densities of CGM absorbers. We use these UVB models to infer ion number densities in the FOGGIE galaxy simulations at $z=2.5$ and use the Synthetic Absorption Line Surveyor Application (SALSA) package to identify absorbers. Absorbers are then matched across UVB models based on their line of sight position so that their column densities can be compared. From our analysis, we find that changing the UVB model produces significant changes in ionization, specifically at lower gas densities and higher temperatures where photoionization dominates over collisional ionization. We also find that the scatter of column density differences between models tends to increase with increasing ionization energy, with the exception of \hi, which has the highest scatter of all species we examined.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. These eccentricities encode information about their early lives. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the Gaia DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode sigma_e ~ 0.3. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to a thousand days (possibly extending to tens of AU). This observed distribution is most likely primordial and its invariance suggests a single universal process. One possibility is eccentricity excitation by circumbinary disks. Another, as is suggested by the Rayleigh form, is weak scattering and ejection of brown-dwarf objects. We explore this latter scenario and find that the binary eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of sigma_e ~ sqrt{M_bd M_*}. So to explain the observed mode, the brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of both proposals remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>
