      <title>The two-nest ants process on triangle-series-parallel graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ants process is a stochastic process introduced by Kious, Mailler and Schapira as a model for the phenomenon of ants finding shortest paths between their nest and a source of food (seen as two marked nodes in a finite graph), with no other means of communications besides the pheromones they lay behind them as they explore their environment. The ants process relies on a reinforcement learning mechanism. In this paper, we modify the ants process by having more than one ants nest (and still one source of food). For technical reasons, we restrict ourselves to the case when there are two nests, and when the graph is a triangle between the two nests and the source of food, whose edges have been replaced by series-parallel graphs. In this setting, using stochastic approximation techniques, comparison with P\'olya urns, and combinatorial arguments, we are able to prove that the ants process converges and to describe its limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exploration in Global Optimization by Noise Injection in the Probability Measures Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: McKean-Vlasov (MKV) systems provide a unifying framework for recent state-of-the-art particlebased methods for global optimization. While individual particles follow stochastic trajectories, the probability law evolves deterministically in the mean-field limit, potentially limiting exploration in multimodal landscapes. We introduce two principled approaches to inject noise directly into the probability law dynamics: a perturbative method based on conditional MKV theory, and a geometric approach leveraging tangent space structure. While these approaches are of independent interest, the aim of this work is to apply them to global optimization. Our framework applies generically to any method that can be formulated as a MKV system. Extensive experiments on multimodal objective functions demonstrate that both our noise injection strategies enhance consistently the exploration and convergence across different configurations of dynamics, such as Langevin, Consensus-Based Optimization, and Stein Boltzmann Sampling, providing a versatile toolkit for global optimization.</description>

      <title>Unconditional well-posedness of the master equation for monotone mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first unconditional well-posedness result for the master equation associated with a general class of mean field games of controls. Our analysis covers games with displacement monotone or Lasry--Lions monotone data, as well as those with a small time horizon. By unconditional, we mean that all assumptions are imposed solely at the level of the Lagrangian and the terminal cost. In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is a foundational Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to formulate and analyse MH in terms of categorical probability, using a recent involutive framework for MH-type procedures as a concrete case study. We show how basic MCMC concepts such as invariance and reversibility can be formulated in Markov categories, and how one part of the MH kernel can be analysed using standard CD categories. To go further, we then study enrichments of CD categories over commutative monoids. This gives an expressive setting for reasoning abstractly about a range of important probabilistic concepts, including substochastic kernels, finite and $\sigma$-finite measures, absolute continuity, singular measures, and Lebesgue decompositions. Using these tools, we give synthetic necessary and sufficient conditions for a general MH-type sampler to be reversible with respect to a given target distribution.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>

      <title>Chernoff bounds for branching random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1604.00056v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities, which have proved very useful in a variety of fields, provide fairly tight bounds on large deviation probabilities while central limit theorem (CLT) describes the asymptotic distribution around the mean (at the $\sqrt{n}$ scale). Harris (1963) conjectured that for a supercritical branching random walk (BRW) of i.i.d offspring and i.i.d displacements, positions of individuals in $nth$ generation approach to Gaussian distribution -- central limit theorem. This conjecture was later proved by Stam (1966) and Kaplan \&amp; Asmussen (1976). Refinements and extensions followed. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no corresponding existing work on concentration inequalities for BRWs. In this note, we propose a new definition of BRW, providing a more general framework. Owing to this definition, a Chernoff-type (subgaussian) bound for BRWs follows directly from the Chernoff bound for random walk. The relation between RW (random walk) and BRW is discussed.</description>

      <title>SLE and its partition function in multiply connected domains via the Gaussian Free Field and restriction measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One way to uniquely define Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) in multiply connected domains is to use the restriction property. This gives an implicit definition of a $\sigma$-finite measure on curves; yet it is in general not clear how to construct such measures nor whether the mass of these measures, called the partition function, is finite.
  We provide an explicit construction of the such conformal restriction SLEs in multiply connected domains when $\kappa = 4$ using the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In particular, both when the target points of the curve are on the same or on distinct boundary components, we show that there is a mixture of laws of level lines of GFFs that satisfies the restriction property. This allows us to give an expression for the partition function of $\mathrm{SLE}_4$ on multiply connected domains and shows that the partition function is finite, answering the question raised in [Lawler, J. Stat. Phys. 2009].
  In a second part, we provide a second construction of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ in multiply-connected domains for the whole range $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$; specific, however, to the case of the two target points belonging to the same boundary components. This is inspired by [Werner, Wu, Electron. J. Probab. 2013] and consists of a mixture of laws on curves obtained by following $\mathrm{CLE}_\kappa$ loops and restriction hulls attached to parts of the boundary of the domain. In this case as well, we obtain as a corollary the finiteness of the partition function for this type of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Mean-Field Jump-Markov Processes on Structured Sparse Disordered Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Large Deviation Principle for {\color{blue} jump-Markov } Processes on sparse large disordered network with disordered connectivity. The network is embedded in a geometric space, with the probability of a connection a (scaled) function of the spatial positions of the nodes. This type of model has numerous applications, including neuroscience, epidemiology and social networks. We prove that the rate function (that indicates the asymptotic likelihood of state transitions) is the same as for a network with all-to-all connectivity. We apply our results to a stochastic $SIS$ epidemiological model on a disordered networks, and determine Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the most likely transition path between different states of the network.</description>

      <title>Generalized random processes related to Hadamard operators and Le Roy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of generalized random processes in Gel'fand sense allows to extend well-known stochastic models, such as the fractional Brownian motion, and study the related fractional pde's, as well as stochastic differential equations in distributional sense. By analogy with the construction (in the infinite-dimensional white-noise space) of the latter, we introduce two processes defined by means of Hadamard-type fractional operators. When used to replace the time derivative in the governing p.d.e.'s, the Hadamard-type derivatives are usually associated with ultra-slow diffusions. On the other hand, in our construction, they directly determine the memory properties of the so-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (H-fBm) and its long-time behaviour. Still, for any finite time horizon, the H-fBm displays a standard diffusing feature. We then extend the definition of the H-fBm from the white noise space to an infinite dimensional grey-noise space built on the Le Roy measure, so that our model represents an alternative to the generalized grey Brownian motion. In this case, we prove that the one-dimensional distribution of the process satisfies a heat equation with non-constant coefficients and fractional Hadamard time-derivative. Finally, once proved the existence of the distributional derivative of the above defined processes and derived an integral formula for it, we construct an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process and evaluate its distribution.</description>

      <title>Discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete analogues of classical operators in harmonic analysis have been widely studied, revealing deep connections with areas such as ergodic theory and analytic number theory. This line of research is commonly known as \emph{Discrete Analogues in Harmonic Analysis (DAHA)}.
  In this paper, we study the $\ell^p$ norms of discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms. Using probabilistic methods, we construct a new class of second-order discrete Riesz transforms $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$. We show that for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, their $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ norms coincide with those of the classical second-order Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when $j \neq k$, and are comparable up to dimensional constants when $j = k$.
  The operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ differ from the discrete analogue $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$ by convolution with an $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ function. Applications are given to the DAHA of the Beurling--Ahlfors operator. We also show that $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ arise as discrete analogues of certain Calder\'on--Zygmund operators $\mathbf{R}^{(jk)}$, which differ from $R^{(jk)}$ by convolution with an $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function. Finally, we conjecture that the $L^p$ norms of $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$, $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$, and $\mathbf{R}^{(jk)}$ agree with those of the classical Riesz transforms, known to equal the corresponding martingale transform norms.</description>

Abstract: We study a system of coalescing continuous-time random walks starting from every site on $\mathbb{Z}$, where the jump increments lie in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable distribution with $\alpha\in(0,1]$. We establish sharp asymptotics for the $N$-point correlation function of the system. Our analysis relies on two precise tail estimates for the system density, as well as the non-collision probability of $N$ independent random walks with arbitrary fixed initial configurations. In addition, we derive refined estimates for heavy-tailed random walks, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the "filtering equations", due to Zakai and Kushner-Stratonovich, arising in nonlinear stochastic filtering. In general situations, notably in correlated diffusion models and when signal coefficients depend on the observation process, the well-posedness is a difficult problem, mainly due to conflicting martingale structures of the involved forward and backward equations. Crisan-Pardoux (2024) address this classical problem with BSPDE techniques, Du et al. (2013), a Sobolev-based approach that however requires increasingly strong regularity assumptions in high dimensions. In this work, we take a new mixed rough stochastic perspective which allows us to derive well-posed rough counterparts of the filtering equations. Importantly, the rough filtering equations are seen, upon randomization, to coincide with the classical filtering equations. Our framework yields well-posedness (existence, uniqueness, stability) under dimension-independent regularity assumptions, providing a robust and conceptually unified solution to a longstanding problem in stochastic filtering theory. To illustrate the flexibility of the method, we also treat rough versions of the classical Kalman-Bucy filter, with characteristics described by a new class of RDEs of rough Riccati type.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in the Tree of Life: A Branching-Process RIFS Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a branching-process random iterated function system (RIFS) defined by a recursive replacement of leaves by finite subtrees at strictly smaller contraction scales. This construction yields a tree-valued, infinite-depth random geometry that unifies classical branching processes and random iterated function systems while remaining distinct from both. We prove rigorously that the resulting branching-process RIFS is multifractal under explicit and mild assumptions. Two variants are analyzed: a non-anchored case with a nontrivial compact attractor, and a biologically motivated anchored case in which the invariant geometric set collapses to a point, while tangent measures obey the same multifractal law. The construction formalizes the foundational principles of nestedness, duality, and randomness in the living tree of life (Hudnall &amp; D'Souza, 2025), yielding a minimal-condition theorem that explains the ubiquity of multifractal signatures in biological data.</description>

Abstract: We derive an Ito-type change-of-variables formula for stochastic processes admitting a causal derivation-divergence representation. The result applies to a broad class of non-semimartingale and rough processes, including Gaussian models with irregular covariance structure. The Ito correction term is expressed explicitly through a product rule for divergences rather than through quadratic variation. This formulation provides a unified operator-theoretic representation of classical and generalized Ito formulas.</description>

Abstract: We propose Matrix-Driven Identification and Reconstruction (MDIR), a SOTA large language model homology method that accurately detects weight correspondences between models and provides rigorous $p$-value estimation of the statistical significance of these correspondences. Our method does not require model inference, and allows the detection of unattributed reuse or replication of model weights even on low-resource devices as it compares only a single pair of matrices at a time. We leverage matrix analysis, polar decomposition, and Large Deviation Theory (LDT) to achieve accurate reconstruction of weight relationships between models. Notably, MDIR is the first method to achieve perfect scores on both Area-Under-Curve (AUC) and accuracy metrics across different source models on LeaFBench.</description>

      <title>First passage of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations, whose Laplace transforms induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Random-Bridges as Stochastic Transports for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper motivates the use of random-bridges -- stochastic processes conditioned to take target distributions at fixed timepoints -- in the realm of generative modelling. Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Study of a TPFA scheme for the stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint through numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic probability approach to loopholes in CHSH experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.</description>
