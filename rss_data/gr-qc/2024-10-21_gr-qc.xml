      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time. Primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$, however, should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian search of massive scalar fields from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive scalar fields are promising candidates to address many unresolved problems in fundamental physics. We report the first model-agnostic Bayesian search of massive scalar fields in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave data. We find no evidence for such fields and place the most stringent upper limits on their coupling for scalar masses $\lesssim 2\times10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. We exemplify the strength of these bounds by applying them to massive scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, finding the tightest constraints on the coupling constant to date, $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}}\lesssim 1\,{\rm km}$ for scalar masses $\lesssim 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ to 90% confidence.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Einstein Rings of Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes Nonminimally Coupled to Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relativistic Einstein rings assuming a nonminimal coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism in a Reissner-Norstr\"om background. Starting from a general action of a nonminimal coupled electrodynamics we show that an unstable effective photon sphere may be obtained in the regime of eikonal approximation. Apart from it, an inner stable photon sphere may also be obtained in the case of large coupling parameters and/or nearly extremal configurations. Restricting ourselves to the outer unstable photon sphere domain we examine the expected angular positions of the first and second relativistic Einstein rings. To compare our results with previous studies in the literature we model the lens as a Galactic supermassive black hole. For fixed coupling parameters we show that such angular positions decrease as the charge parameter increases. The angular separation between the first and second rings is also evaluated. We show that such separation increases as the charge parameter increases. These patterns are not followed by nearly extremal configurations. In this case we show that there is an overlap domain so that the angular position and the corresponding coupling parameter do not allow one to differ extremal cases from complementary configurations which satisfy the cosmic censorship hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with several future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Traces of quantum fuzziness on the black hole shadow and particle deflection in the multi-fractional theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of black holes within the framework of multi-fractional theories of gravity, focusing on the effects of q-derivatives and weighted derivatives. These modifications, which introduce scale-dependent spacetime geometries, alter black hole solutions in intriguing ways. Within these frameworks, we analyze two key observable phenomena - black hole shadows and particle deflection angle in the weak field limit - using both analytical techniques and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr A*. The study from $q$-derivative formalism reveals that the multi-scale length $\ell_*$ influences the size of the black hole shadow in two ways, and modifies the weak deflection angle. Constraints on $\ell_*$ are derived from the EHT observations, showing significant deviations from standard Schwarzschild black hole predictions, which range from $10^{9}$ to $10^{10}$ orders of magnitude. Additionally, the weak deflection angle is computed using the non-asymptotic generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, revealing the effects of finite-distance and multi-scale parameters. Using the Sun for Solar System test, the constraints for $\ell_*$ range from $10^{8}$ to $10^{9}$ orders of magnitude. Results from the weighted derivative formalism generates a dS/AdS-like behavior, where smaller deviations are found in the strong field regime than in the weak field regime. The results suggest that while these effects are subtle, they provide a potential observational signature of quantum gravity effects. The findings presented here contribute to the broader effort of testing alternative theories of gravity through black hole observations, offering a new perspective on the quantum structure of spacetime at cosmological and astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Detector Sensitivity to Eccentric Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers carries crucial information about the binary's formation and environment. There are emerging signs that some of the mergers detected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors could indeed be eccentric. Nevertheless, the identification of eccentricity via gravitational waves remains challenging, to a large extent because of the limited availability of eccentric gravitational waveforms. While multiple suites of eccentric waveforms have recently been developed, they each cover only a part of the binary parameter space. Here we evaluate the sensitivity of LIGO to eccentric waveforms from the SXS and RIT numerical relativity catalogs and the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model using data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's third observing run. The obtained sensitivities, as functions of eccentricity, mass and mass ratio, are important inputs to understanding detection prospects and observational population constrains. In addition, our results enable the comparison of the waveforms to establish their compatibility and applicability for searches and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Analytic expressions for grey-body factors of the general parametrized spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the recently discovered connection between grey-body factors and quasinormal ringing, we derive analytic expressions for the grey-body factors of generic parametrized spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. These expressions are presented as expansions in terms of the inverse multipole number and the coefficients of the parametrization. The obtained analytic formulas serve as good approximations whenever the deviation from the Schwarzschild geometry is not very large. We demonstrate that the primary parameter determining the grey-body factors is the deviation of the event horizon radius from its Schwarzschild value, while the higher-order coefficients of the parametrization, which govern the near-horizon geometry, are much less significant. This finding is consistent with recent observations that grey-body factors are considerably more stable against small deformations of the near-horizon geometry than quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Classification of Petrov Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the final stage of the Petrov classification is carried out. As it is known, the Killing vector fields specify infinitesimal transformations of the group of motions of space $V_4$. In the case when in the homogeneous space $V_4$ the group of motions $G_3$ acts simply transitive, the geometry of the non-isotropic hypersurface is determined by the geometry of the transitivity space $V_3$ of the group $G_3$. In this case, the metric tensor of the space $V_3$ can be given by a nonholonomic reper consisting of three independent vectors $\ell_{(a)}^\alpha$, which define the generators of the group $G_3$ of finite transformations in the space $V_3$. The representation of the metric tensor of $V_4$ spaces by means of vector fields $\ell_{(a)}^\alpha$ has a great physical meaning and allows to simplify substantially the equations of mathematical physics in such spaces. Therefore, the Petrov classification should be complemented by the classification of vector fields $\ell_{(a)}^\alpha$ connected to Killing vector fields. For homogeneous spaces this problem has been largely solved. A complete solution of this problem is presented in the present paper, where the Petrov classification for homogeneous spaces in which the group $G_3$, which belongs to type $VIII$ according to the Petrov classification, acts simply transitively, is refined. In addition, the complete classification of vector fields $\ell_{(a)}^\alpha$ for spaces $V_4$ in which the group $G_3$ acts simply transitivity on isotropic hypersurfaces.}</description>

      <title>Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety of gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's capability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns about waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration signals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it challenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling methods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques. In this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\tt RIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave models without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate that we can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole binary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the numerical relativity surrogate model ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all available $m\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes on LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole binary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that the selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we analyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria challenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we find ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to complete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$ hours to complete.</description>

      <title>Shadow of Quantum Improved Regular Kerr Black Hole and parameter constrains with EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Improved Regular Kerr (QIRK) Black Hole is a rotating regular black hole based on the asymptotic safety method. This black hole not only resolves ring singularity and avoids closed timelike curves, but also has well defined thermodynamics. Therefore, it is crucial to find some observable features of this rotating black hole. In this article, we numerically determine the specific parameter range of the QIRK black hole after ensuring the three key properties mentioned above, while investigating its black hole shadow, we find that the extremal QIRK black hole, under a critical angular momentum $a_{\mathrm{cri}}$, can have a similar shadow to the non extremal Kerr black hole. Furthermore, with recent observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) of Sgr A* and earlier observations of the supermassive black hole M87*, we constrain the QIRK black hole using observational data and explore its potential as an astronomical object.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Scale-Dependent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by the spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of space from the first law of thermodynamics in the braneworld scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent space paradigm is a unique way to understand the universe's expansion. In this paradigm, as proposed by Padmanabhan in the context of Einstein's gravity the expansion of the universe is driven by the difference between the degrees of freedom on the horizon surface and that within the bulk enclosed by the horizon. This principle called the law of emergence, has been extended to more general gravity theories like Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity. We derive the law of emergence for braneword models of gravity, starting from the more fundamental and well established principle, the first law of thermodynamics. More specifically, we derive the law of emergence in the context of RS II braneworld, warped DGP model and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld. The significance of the braneworld theory is that the observable universe could be a 3+1 surface or brane embedded in 3+1+d dimensional bulk spacetime. We further compared the derived law with the one proposed by Sheykhi for braneworld models. Our results strongly suggests that the unified first law of thermodynamics is the backbone of the law of emergence.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for gravitational shadows in static spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation theory for surfaces confining photons and massive particles in static spherically symmetric spacetimes in terms of two parameters: the mass-to-energy ratio and the deviation of metric functions from a given form, e.g., the Schwarzschild solution. Expansions of the gravitational shadow radius in terms of these parameters are constructed up to the second order. The metric expansion in terms of the Schwarzschild mass-to-radius ratio is then reconstructed. Explicit analytical examples of non-standard black hole metrics are considered as an illustration. In some cases perturbative results demonstrate good accuracy even for non-small deviations.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes in Constant Curvature Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the massive gauge field within spacetime context from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quotient of the constant curvature black hole. We investigate how the matter field's back reaction affects the spacetime geometry, considering perturbations in the metric up to the first order. The stress-energy tensor's expectation value can be precisely calculated by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By appropriately selecting boundary conditions for the massive vector field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient manifold, achieving a negative average energy along a null geodesic becomes feasible, enabling a traversable wormhole.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: a gauge invariant study for spherical evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherical evolution in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with additional Ricci coupling and use the gauge-invariant approach of Ref.~\cite{Reall:2021voz} to track well-posedness. Our results show that loss of hyperbolicity when it occurs, is due to the behaviour of physical degrees of freedom. They provide further support to the idea that this behaviour can be tamed by additional interactions of scalar. We also point out a limitation of this gauge-invariant approach: the fact that field redefinitions can change the character of the evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approaches to Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Detected by a Burst Search in LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries II: Noether Realization in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the gravitational phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid $\mathcal{T}$ which allows us to include radiation in an algebraic framework. We show that $\mathcal{T}$ admits a non-linear realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. Besides, this Noether charge is conserved in the absence of radiation. Moreover, at non radiative cuts, the algebroid can be restricted to the wedge symmetry algebra studied in ArXiv:2409.12178. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is also represented canonically.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to cosmological non-linearities as an effective fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two parameters extension of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to capture the impact of matter inhomogeneities on the background evolution of the Universe. Non virialized but non-linearly evolving overdense and underdense regions, whose abundance is quantified using the Press-Schechter formalism, are collectively described by two effective perfect fluids $\rho_{\rm{c}},\rho_{\rm{v}}$ with non vanishing equation of state parameters $w_{\rm{c,v}}\neq 0$. These fluids are coupled to the pressureless dust, akin to an interacting DM-DE scenario. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, and could potentially address a number of inconsistencies of the standard model, including a simultaneous resolution of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions. To assess the viability of the model, we set initial conditions compatible to the Planck 2018 best fit $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and fit its additional parameters using SN~Ia observations from DESY5 and a sample of uncorrelated $f\sigma_8$ measurements. Our findings show that backreaction effects from the cosmic web could restore the concordance between early and late Universe cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Photon ring polarimetry with next-generation black hole imaging I. M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-horizon region of a black hole impacts linear (LP) and circular polarization (CP) through strong lensing of photons, adding large-scale symmetries and anti-symmetries to the polarized image. To probe the signature of lensing in polarimetry, we utilise a geometric model of concentric, Gaussian rings of equal radius to investigate the transition in the Fourier plane at which the photon ring signal begins to dominate over the direct image. We find analytic, closed-form expressions for the transition radii in total intensity, LP, and CP, wherein the resultant formulae are composed of ratios of tunable image parameters, with the overall "scale" set primarily by the thickness of the direct image. Using these formulae, we compute the transition radii for time-averaged images of M87* simulations at 230 GHz, studying both Magnetically Arrested Disc (MAD) and Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) configurations for various spin and electron heating models. We compare geometric values to radii obtained directly from the simulations through a coherent averaging scheme. We find that nearly all MAD models have a photon ring-dominated CP signal on long baselines shorter than the Earth diameter at 230 GHz. Across favored models for the M87* accretion flow identified by EHT polarimetric constraints, we quantify the sensitivity and antenna size requirements for the next-generation EHT and the Black Hole Explorer orbiter to detect these features. We find that the stringent requirements for CP favour explorations using long baselines on the ground, while LP remains promising on Earth-space baselines.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we point out that, unlike previously asserted in the literature, a transient gravitational wave signal from the inspiral phase of light black hole mergers is in principle detectable with current and future high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, including but not limited to ADMX. The largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA's capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principal in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of the black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

Abstract: In this work, we are interested in how spinning effects influence the electronic properties of the graphene wormhole. For this purpose, we have described the graphene by the wormhole background based on the model developed by Gonz\'alez and his co-workers. By applying a coordinate transformation in the metric of graphene wormhole, we can introduce rotating effects. In the continuum limit, by solving the massless Dirac equation in the context of a rotating wormhole background, we obtain the Landau levels for the rotating graphene wormhole. We still have exposed the analogy between the graphene wormhole and fermions on the G\"odel-type spacetime.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl Anomaly in 8d from General Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the holographic central charges for general higher curvature gravity theory dual to eight dimensional CFT. To do this, we first elaborate the general form of Weyl anomaly in 8d CFT and find 11 non-trivial linearly independent curvature combinations, one of which is Euler density and the rest are Weyl invariants, including 7 non-differentiated ones and 3 differentiated ones. The Weyl invariants are constructed as invariant polynomials of curvature tensor and covariant derivatives. We denote $W_{(n)}$ as the Weyl invariant that contains a polynormial term with a minimum of $n$ curvature tensors. Interestingly, since there are a total of 12 Weyl invariants in 8d, our finding means two of them are trivial and expressible as total derivatives. The resulting central charges are expressed in terms of 15 theory-dependent constants. Remarkably, we find that the $W_{(2)}$ invariant corresponds to the $c$-charge that is proportional to $C_T$, while the two $W_{(3)}$'s are related to three-point function parameters of energy-momentum tensor. This suggests a possible connection between the $c$-charges of $W_{(n)}$'s and the $n$-point functions of energy-momentum tensor.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel holographic dictionary for the thermodynamics of black holes with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating asymptotics, generalizing the dictionary for Anti-de Sitter black holes. Using our dictionary we show that the holographic Euler equation is dual to a generalized Smarr formula for these black holes, and we find a precise match between the extended bulk and boundary first law. Notably, the dictionary for the central charge appearing in the Euler relation depends on the hyperscaling violating parameter, but not on the Lifshitz dynamical exponent.</description>

Abstract: Diagrammatic approaches to perturbation theory transformed the practicability of calculations in particle physics. In the case of extended theories of gravity, however, obtaining the relevant diagrammatic rules is non-trivial: we must expand in metric perturbations and around (local) minima of the scalar field potentials, make multiple field redefinitions, and diagonalize kinetic and mass mixings. In this note, we will motivate these theories, introduce the package FeynMG -- a Mathematica extension of FeynRules that automates the process described above -- and highlight an application to a model with unique collider phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the three-loop level and the four-point correlation function up to the two-loop one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for detecting gravitational waves through their influence on the shape of resolved astronomical objects. This method, complementary to pulsar timing arrays and astrometric techniques, explores the time-dependent distortions caused by gravitational waves on the shapes of celestial bodies, such as galaxies or any resolved extended object. By developing a formalism based on that adopted in the analysis of weak lensing effects, we derive the response functions for gravitational wave-induced distortions and compute their angular correlation functions. Our results highlight the sensitivity of these distortions to the lowest frequencies of the gravitational wave spectrum and demonstrate how they produce distinct angular correlation signatures, including null and polarisation-sensitive correlations. These findings pave the way for future high-resolution surveys to exploit this novel observable, potentially offering new insights into the stochastic gravitational wave background and cosmological models.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel extension to the Klinkhamer vacuum-defect model by incorporating a fifth spatial dimension. This modification results in the formulation of a comprehensive five-dimensional wormhole space-time. Crucially, this extension preserves its classification as a vacuum solution to the field equations, thereby automatically satisfying all energy conditions. We demonstrate that this five-dimensional vacuum-defect space-time can be expressed in a pure canonical form, and thus, locally reduces to five-dimensional Minkowski space. Finally, we explore the geodesic equations in the vicinity of this five-dimensional vacuum-defect wormhole, offering insights into its intriguing properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presently open problem of the Hubble tension is shown to be removed in the context of a modified theory of gravity with a non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. By evolving the cosmological parameters that match the cosmic microwave background data until their values from direct late-time measurements, we obtain an agreement between different experimental methods without disrupting their individual validity. These modified gravity models are shown to provide adequate fits for other observational data from recent astrophysical surveys and to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe without the inclusion of a cosmological constant. This compatibility with observations presents further evidence of the versatility of these models in mimicking diverse cosmological phenomena in a unified manner.</description>

Abstract: Non-singular horizonless ultracompact objects provide a simple resolution to the black holes singularity problem. It has been shown that, if these objects are compact enough to exhibit the presence of the light-ring required to mimic the phenomenology of general relativity black holes, they must have at least one additional light-ring. The stability of the inner light ring has been proven under the assumption of Einstein equations and the validity of the null energy condition. Since this can have important repercussions on the instability of a horizonless ultracompact object and the existence of the latter requires some modified gravitational dynamics and/or exotic matter, it is desirable to obtain a model-independent proof of the stability of the additional light-ring. In this paper, we prove the stability of the inner light-ring without any assumption on the dynamics of the theory, while assuming that the outer light-ring has the same properties as the Kerr light-ring. Given the stringent observational constraints on the geometry at the outer light-ring scale, our result now rests solely on geometric considerations and applies to any theory of gravity with any matter content that cannot be ruled out by observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflation with Null Energy Condition Violation: Prospects for Taiji</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji's ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable precision improvement of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji's potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper charged black holes are obtained assuming that a Born-Infeld electrodynamics may arise from an interaction between the electromagnetic field and a vacuum component. In this context Cauchy horizons do not appear in the maximal analytical extension once an event horizon is formed so that the interior spacetime does not suffer from any sort of instabilities which are well known in the literature. On the contrary, the causal structure exhibits an event horizon -- encapsulating a spacelike singularity -- and a cosmological horizon. We show that the strong cosmic censorship is then restored for a wide range of the parameters including configurations in which the black hole charge is much larger than its mass. We also show that the black hole thus formed described by our solution exhibits an unstable photon sphere analogous to that of the Schwarzschild metric.</description>

      <title>Fast inspirals and the treatment of orbital resonances</title>

Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact object orbits a massive black hole, are a key source of gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to their small mass ratio, ($\epsilon \sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-7}$), the binary evolves slowly and EMRI signals will be in-band for years. Additionally, astrophysical EMRIs are expected to have complex dynamics featuring both spin-precession and eccentricity. A standard approach to modelling these inspirals is via the method of osculating geodesics (OG) which we employ along with a toy model for the gravitational self-force. Using this method requires resolving tens of thousands radial and polar orbital librations over the long duration of the signal which makes the inspiral trajectory expensive to compute. In this work we accelerate these calculations by employing Near-Identity (averaging) Transformations. However, this averaging technique breaks down at orbital resonances where the radial and polar frequencies are an integer ratio of each other. Thus, we switch to a partial averaging transformation in the vicinity of the resonance where the dynamics are characterised by the slow evolution of the so-called "resonant phase". Additionally, we develop an optimal switching criterion to minimise the computation time while maximising accuracy. We find the error in the waveform phase is improved from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ in the fully averaged scheme to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{4/7})$ in the switching scheme. At the same time, this scheme improves the scaling of the computation time from being inversely proportional to $\epsilon$ using OG, to a very weak scaling with $\epsilon$. This results in a speed-up of at least two orders of magnitude for LISA EMRIs with room for further optimisation.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the so-called Ricci-based gravity theories, a family of extensions of General Relativity whose action is given by a non-linear function of contractions and products of the (symmetric part of the) Ricci tensor of an independent connection, the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory is obtained. To do so, the independent connection is decomposed in two parts, one compatible with a metric tensor and the other one given by a 3-rank tensor. Subsequently, the Riemann tensor is expressed in terms of its projected components onto a hypersurface, allowing to construct the $3+1$ decomposition of the theory and the corresponding Gauss-Codazzi relations, where the boundary terms naturally arise in the gravitational action. Finally, the ADM decomposition is followed in order to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian and the ADM energy for any Ricci-based gravity theory. The formalism is applied to the simple case of Schwarzschild space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the ringdown complex amplitudes of nonspinning unequal-mass binaries in arbitrarily eccentric orbits are presented. They are built upon 237 numerical simulations contained within the RIT catalog, through the parameterisation introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 101401]. Global fits for the complex amplitudes, associated to linear quasinormal mode frequencies of the dominant ringdown modes, are obtained in a factorised form immediately applicable to any existing quasi-circular model. Similarly to merger amplitudes, ringdown ones increase by more than 50% compared to the circular case for high impact parameters (medium eccentricities), while strongly suppressed in the low impact parameter (highly eccentric) limit. Such reduction can be explained by a transition between an "orbital-type" and an "infall-type" dynamics. The amplitudes (phases) fits accuracy lies around a few percent (deciradians) for the majority of the dataset, comparable to the accuracy of current state-of-the-art quasi-circular ringdown models, and well within current statistical errors of current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ringdown observations. These expressions constitute another building block towards the construction of complete general-relativistic inspiral-merger-ringdown semi-analytical templates, and allow to extend numerically-informed spectroscopic analyses beyond the circular limit. Such generalisations are key to achieve accurate inference of compact binaries astrophysical properties, and tame astrophysical systematics within observational investigations of strong-field general relativistic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum and dynamical instability, as well as the transient effect of the tensor perturbation for the so-called Maeda-Dadhich black hole, a type of Kaluza-Klein black hole, in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity have been investigated in framework of pseudospectrum. We cast the problem of solving quasinormal modes (QNMs) in AdS-like spacetime as the linear evolution problem of the non-normal operator in null slicing by using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In terms of spectrum instability, based on the generalised eigenvalue problem, the QNM spectrum and $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum has been studied, while the open structure of $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum caused by the non-normality of operator indicates the spectrum instability. In terms of dynamical instability, we introduce the concept of the distance to dynamical instability, which plays a crucial role in bridging the spectrum instability and the dynamical instability. We calculate such distance, named the complex stability radius, as parameters vary. Finally, we show the behaviour of the energy norm of the evolution operator, which can be roughly reflected by the three kinds of abscissas in context of pseudospectrum, and find the transient growth of the energy norm of the evolution operator.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamics of Black Holes with Proper Conserved Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field equations of a classical, geometric, theory of gravity, augmented with some semiclassical considerations strongly suggest that the gravitational field representing a stationary black hole can be simply described with a few thermodynamical coordinates and their conjugates that obey the four laws of thermodynamics plus the Smarr formula and the reverse isoperimetric inequality that bounds the maximum entropy for a given effective volume of space. The thermodynamics of black holes is a promising window to the quantum nature of black holes; hence, it is important to understand all the details of these laws. The identification and the meaning of these thermodynamic coordinates depend on the gravity theory under consideration. For example, the existence of dimensionful coupling constants, such as the cosmological constant, changes the scaling properties of the theory, its solutions, and the laws of thermodynamics. Here we show, using the background Killing charge method, which applies to the black hole solutions of any gravity theory that has a maximally symmetric vacuum, to define the mass and angular momentum, instead of using the Komar mass and the angular momentum, how the thermodynamics of black holes such as the $D$ dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in cosmological Einstein's theory and the spherically symmetric black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory changes. We give the effective volume of black holes even without a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a new solution of Einstein field equations which describes a boosted Kerr-Newman black hole relative to a Lorentz frame at future null infinity. To simplify our analysis we consider a particular configuration in which the boost is aligned with the black hole angular momentum. The boosted Kerr-Newman black hole is obtained considering the complete asymptotic Lorentz transformations of Robinson-Trautman coordinates to Bondi-Sachs, including the perturbation term of the boosted Robinson-Trautman metric. To verify that the final form of the metric is indeed a solution of Einstein field equations, we evaluate the corresponding energy-momentum tensor the boosted Kerr-Newman solution. To this end, we consider the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor built with the Kerr boosted metric together with its timelike killing vector. We show that the Papapetrou field thus obtained engender an energy-momentum tensor which satisfies Einstein field equations up to 4th order for the Kerr-Newman metric. To proceed, we examine the causal structure of the boosted Kerr-Newman black hole in Bondi-Sachs coordinates as in a preferred timelike foliation. We show that the ultimate effect of a nonvanishing charge is to shrink the overall size of the event horizon and ergosphere areas when compared to the neutral boosted Kerr black holes. Considering the preferred timelike foliation we obtain the electromagnetic fields for a proper nonrotating frame of reference. We show that while the electric field displays a pure radial behaviour, the magnetic counterpart develops an involved structure with two intense lobes of the magnetic field observed in the direction opposite to the boost.</description>

      <title>Gravitational spin Hall effect of electrons in Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the non-relativistic Hamiltonian for electrons within the Schwarzschild metric from covariant Dirac equations, using both the weak field approximation and the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This Hamiltonian incorporates a gravitational spin-orbit coupling term, resulting in the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), which separates electrons by their spin. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation for these electrons, we investigate the gravitational SHE as they orbit a non-rotating gravitational source. Our findings reveal that the spin-dependent separation of electrons increases in proportion to their orbital periods, significantly improving the detectability of gravitational SHE. Specifically, for electrons in a low Earth orbit, the separation is estimated to be $3.0\times 10^{-12}\, \text{m}$ annually. These results indicate the practicality of detecting the gravitational SHE in electrons orbiting Earth, especially with prolonged orbital durations, underscoring the potential for quantum test of the Weak Equivalence Principle.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Shadows and parameter estimation of rotating quantum corrected black holes and constraints from EHT observation of M87* and Sgr A*</title>

Abstract: The scarcity of quantum gravity (QG) inspired rotating black holes limits the progress of testing QG through observational data, such as that from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Recently, the EHT imaged the supermassive black holes, Sgr A* revealing an angular shadow diameter of $d_{sh} = 48.7 \pm 7 \mu$as with a black hole mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$. For M87*, with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, the EHT measured an angular diameter of $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as. These observations, consistent with Kerr black hole shadows in general relativity, introduce a new tool to investigate gravity in extreme conditions. Inspired by these, we present rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) spacetimes with an additional QC parameter $\alpha$, examine its effect on the shadow properties, and constrain it by EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*. For angular shadow diameter ($d_{sh}$) of Sgr A* at $\theta_o = 50^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.443 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.8066 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.447 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.894 M)$. While for M87* at inclination $\theta_o = 17^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 0.8985 M^2$ and $a \in (0.6157M, 0.8511 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 0.4141 M^2$ and $a \in (0.8262M, 0.9799 M)$. These results demonstrate that $\alpha$ enormously impacts the shadow's size and shape, providing essential constraints on QG models. In conjunction with the EHT constraints from the Sgr A* and M87* observables, the RQCBHs and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in the substantial regions of the EHT-constrained parameter space, and the former may be strong candidates for astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein static Universe with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state and the static Einstein Universe are the unique states, which have constant Ricci scalar curvature ${\cal R}$. Earlier it was shown that such unique symmetry of the de Sitter state leads to the special thermodynamic properties of this state, which are determined by the local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, where $R$ is the radius of the cosmological horizon. Then, what happens in static Universe? We consider the Einstein Universe, which has boundary. This can be the real physical boundary, or the border between two halves of the $R\times S^3$ Universe, if there is no contact between the halves. It appears that the static Einstein Universe with boundary is characterized by the same local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$ as the de Sitter state. The thermodynamics of the bounded Einstein Universe is also similar to that of de Sitter. If this Universe contains Zel'dovich stiff matter, there is the holographic connection between the entropy of the Universe and the surface entropy $A/4G$ of the boundary. This means that in thermodynamics the physical boundary of the static Einstein Universe plays the role of the de Sitter cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</description>

      <title>Linear independence of field equations in the Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solving the Brans-Dicke (BD) equations in the BD theory of gravity, their linear independence is important. This is due to fact that in solving these equations in cosmology, if the number of unknown quantities is equal to the number of independent equations, then the unknowns can be uniquely determined. In the BD theory, the tensor field $g_{\mu \nu}$ and the BD scalar field $\varphi$ are not two separate fields, but they are coupled together. The reason behind this is a corollary that proposed by V. B. Johri and D. Kalyani in cosmology, which states that the cosmic scale factor of the universe, $a$, and the BD scalar field $\varphi$ are related by a power law. Therefore, when the principle of least action is used to derive the BD equations, the variations $\delta g^{\mu \nu}$ and $\delta \varphi$ should not be considered as two independent dynamical variables. So, there is a constraint on $\delta g^{\mu \nu}$ and $\delta \varphi$ that causes the number of independent BD equations to decrease by one unit, in such a way that in the equations that have been known as BD equations, one of them is redundant. In this paper, we prove this issue, that is, we show that one of these equations, which we choose as the modified Klein-Gordon equation, is not an independent equation, but a result establishing other BD equations, the law of conservation of energy-momentum of matter and Bianchi's identity. Therefore, we should not look at the modified Klein-Gordon equation as an independent field equation in the BD theory, but rather it is included in the other BD equations and should not be mentioned separately as one of the BD equations once again.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints from Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe that undergoes a period of exponential expansion very early on, named inflation. This stretches quantum fluctuations from the onset of inflation to cosmological scales, which seed the temperature, polarization and matter anisotropies that we observe. However, this paradigm ignores pre-inflationary physics, as shortly before inflation there is the initial big-bang singularity. Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a promising approach to quantum cosmology. Its most outstanding result is that of the resolution of the classical initial singularity in terms of a quantum bounce that connects a contracting branch of the Universe with an expanding one. Consequently, it provides singularity-free pre-inflationary dynamics. Within this context, it is no longer justified to consider that every mode of the cosmological perturbations reaches the onset of inflation in the natural vacuum state of standard cosmology. In fact, some modes might reach it in an excited state, which may leave imprints in their power spectra at the end of inflation and therefore in observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The goal of this thesis is to search for such imprints from LQC in the CMB. We work in the hybrid approach to cosmological perturbations in LQC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thick-brane solutions within the five-dimensional bumblebee gravity in the presence of a real scalar field. Specifically, we implement the Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario within this context and obtain brane-like structures. Since the contribution of the bumblebee field is expected to be weak, we solve the field equations in the small-parameter regime. In this situation, we develop a first-order framework to describe the brane. The results show that the function which drives the bumblebee field may engender a lumplike structure whose shape depends on the parameters. On one hand, the effect of the non-minimal coupling, controlled by $\xi$, between the bumblebee field and gravity shifts the field from the vacuum expectation value. On the other hand, the aether parameter, $\beta$, is responsible for modifying the solution inside the brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the low-energy limit, the near region of a generic Kerr black hole has been conjectured to be holographically dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory. In this paper, we consider a test object orbiting in the near region of a nonextremal Kerr black hole. We first couple it to a massless scalar field. The resulting scalar radiation at the horizon is computed from the perspectives of gravity and dual conformal field theory. Considering the influence of nonzero temperature, the agreement of both computations is found. Then, we generalize the analysis to the gravitational radiation and find agreement again. The agreement supports the conjectured holography and provides a potential theoretical tool for gravitational wave computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass) holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the luminosity distance of propagating gravitational waves can provide invaluable information on the geometry and content of our Universe. Due to the clustering of cosmic structures, in realistic situations we need to average the luminosity distance of events coming from patches inside a volume. In this work we evaluate, in a gauge-invariant and fully-relativistic treatment, the impact of cosmological perturbations on such averaging process. We find that clustering, lensing and peculiar velocity effects impact estimates for future detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO. The signal-to-noise ratio of the angular power spectrum of the average luminosity distance over all the redshift bins is 17 in the case of binary black holes detected by Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We also provide fitting formulas for the corrections to the average luminosity distance due to general relativistic effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Soft Limits of Gluon and Graviton Correlators in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive formulae for the soft limit of tree-level gluon and graviton correlators in Anti-de Sitter space, which arise from Feynman diagrams encoding the Weinberg soft theorems in flat space. Other types of diagrams can also contribute to the soft limit at leading order in the soft momentum, but have a different pole structure. We derive these results at four points using explicit formulae recently obtained from the cosmological bootstrap and double copy, and extend them to any multiplicity using bootstrap techniques in Mellin-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has made breakthrough discoveries in gravitational-wave astronomy, a new field that provides a different means of observing our Universe. Gravitational-wave discoveries are possible thanks to the work of thousands of people from across the globe working together. In this article, we discuss the range of engagement activities used to communicate LVK gravitational-wave discoveries and the stories of the people behind the science, using the activities surrounding the release of the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog as a case study.</description>

Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs in dense astrophysical environments, such as planets or stars.</description>

      <title>Swiftly chasing gravitational waves across the sky in real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, dubbed `continuous commanding,' achieving 10 seconds latency response time on-orbit to unscheduled Target of Opportunity requests. This allows Swift to respond to early warning gravitational-wave detections, rapidly slewing the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) across the sky to place the GW origin in the BAT field of view at merger time. This will dramatically increase the GW/GRB co-detection rate, and enable prompt arcminute localization of a neutron star merger. We simulate the full Swift response to a GW early warning alert, including input sky maps produced at different warning times, a complete model of Swift's attitude control system, and a full accounting of the latency between the GW detectors and the spacecraft. 60 s of early warning doubles the rate of prompt GRB detections with arcminute position, and 140 s guarantees observation anywhere on the unocculted sky, even with localization areas &gt;&gt; 1000 deg$^2$. While 140 s is beyond current gravitational wave detector sensitivities, 30-70 s is achievable today. We show that the detection yield is now limited by the latency of LIGO/Virgo cyber-infrastructure, and motivate focus on its reduction. Continuous commanding is now a general capability of Swift, significantly increasing its versatility in response to the growing demands of time-domain astrophysics. We demonstrate this potential on an externally triggered Fast Radio Burst, slewing 81 degrees across the sky, and collecting X-ray and UV photons from the source position &lt; 150 s after the trigger was received from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), thereby setting the earliest and deepest such constraints on high energy activity from non-repeating FRBs. The Swift Team invites proposals for novel scientific applications of ultra-low latency UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field decreases the mass of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the deformation of rotating NSs.</description>
