      <title>Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperatures Strongly Mischaracterise Urban Heat Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escalating urban heat, driven by the convergence of global warming and rapid urbanization, is a profound threat to billions of city dwellers. The science directing urban heat adaptation is strongly influenced by studies that use satellite-based land surface temperature (LST), which is readily available globally and address data gaps in cities, particularly in the Global South. LST, however, is a poor surrogate for near-surface air temperature, physiologically relevant human thermal comfort, or direct human heat exposure. This flawed practice leads to issues for several downstream use cases by inflating adaptation benefits, distorting the magnitude and variability of urban heat signals across scales, and thus misguiding urban adaptation policy. We argue that satellite-based LST must be treated as a distinct indicator of surface climate, which, though relevant to the urban surface energy budget, can be frequently decoupled from human-relevant thermal impacts especially during daytime. Only by a disciplined application of this variable, combined with complementary datasets, process-based and data-driven models, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration, can urban adaptation design and policy be effectively advanced.</description>

      <title>A data-driven global ocean forecasting model with sub-daily and eddy-resolving resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity ocean forecasting at high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-scale dynamical features, with profound implications for hazard prediction, maritime navigation, and sustainable ocean management. While conventional numerical models can generate sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they demand substantial computational resources and often struggle to maintain predictive skill at such fine scales. Data-driven models offer a promising alternative with significantly higher computational efficiency; however, most are constrained to daily outputs and show a rapid decay in accuracy when extended to sub-daily timescales. Here, we introduce TianHai, the first-of-its-kind global data-driven 6-hour forecasting model, which delivers predictions at 1/12{\deg} eddy-resolving resolution with a vertical extent down to 1,500 m. A key feature of TianHai is the integration of atmospheric forcings through FuXi-Atmosphere, a data-driven atmospheric forecasting system, which enables the explicit representation of air-sea coupling effects. Unlike conventional approaches, TianHai does not rely on numerical atmospheric models or external meteorological forecasts, making it a fully data-driven framework for coupled prediction. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that TianHai delivers state-of-the-art performance in forecasting temperature and salinity profiles, zonal and meridional currents, sea surface temperature, and sea level anomalies for lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days.</description>

      <title>An idealized general circulation model for the atmospheric circulation on the ice giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are the least explored planets in the Solar System. A key question regarding the two planets is the similarity of their observed flows despite the great differences in their obliquity and internal heating. To answer this fundamental question and understand the ice giants atmospheric circulation, we developed a new general circulation model (GCM). This tool will also be key to facilitating the success of future missions to the ice giants, for which atmospheric flows will be a measurable quantity. Past GCMs for the ice giants have struggled to reproduce the observed winds on Uranus and Neptune. Using our idealized GCM, we systematically explored how the zonal wind and meridional circulation respond to different model and physical parameters; our main focus was on the depth of the domain. We show that in cases where the bottom layer of the model is deep enough, the simulated flow is independent of the meridional structure of the forcing temperature, indicating that dynamical processes, and not the imposed thermal forcing, are the dominant drivers of the circulation and the thermal structure. A momentum balance analysis further shows that meridional and vertical eddy momentum flux convergence are both central to maintaining the circulation. These results provide a physical explanation for the similarity of the flow on Uranus and Neptune although their solar and internal forcing are significantly different. The modeling framework developed in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of more comprehensive GCMs of the ice giants and help guide the interpretation of future mission data.</description>

      <title>Key role of the Madden-Julian Oscillation on humid heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humid heat stress and heatwaves pose significant risks for living organisms, from humans and wildlife to insects, with wide-ranging health, ecological, and socio-economic impacts that are expected to worsen with climate change. How large-scale climate modes drive the week-to-month variability of humid heat remains poorly understood at the global scale, hindering accurate forecasts necessary for risk-management measures, notably in the heavily populated and ecologically fragile regions of the tropics and subtropics. With forecast lead times up to several weeks, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a global-scale intraseasonal tropical atmospheric wave circumnavigating Earth in around 30-60 days, provides considerable predictability for weather conditions, and meteorological and oceanic extremes. Here we show that the MJO, and the associated boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO), have a significant influence on humid heatwaves over much of the tropics and subtropics across all seasons, both over terrestrial and marine regions. Humid heatwave likelihood can double or halve, depending on the MJO phase, in large areas of the Earth. The MJO/BSISO's influence on wet-bulb temperature is primarily via specific humidity rather than dry-bulb temperature anomalies. We find that specific humidity anomalies are influenced by horizontal advection of moisture in the planetary boundary layer, particularly in the subtropics where advection of the climatological moisture gradient by MJO-related anomalous winds is the dominant term.</description>

      <title>FastNet: Improving the physical consistency of machine-learning weather prediction models through loss function design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models have demonstrated remarkable potential in delivering accurate forecasts at significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, challenges remain in ensuring the physical consistency of MLWP outputs, particularly in deterministic settings. This study presents FastNet, a graph neural network (GNN)-based global prediction model, and investigates the impact of alternative loss function designs on improving the physical realism of its forecasts. We explore three key modifications to the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss: (1) a modified spherical harmonic (MSH) loss that penalises spectral amplitude errors to reduce blurring and enhance small-scale structure retention; (2) inclusion of horizontal gradient terms in the loss to suppress non-physical artefacts; and (3) an alternative wind representation that decouples speed and direction to better capture extreme wind events. Results show that while the MSH and gradient-based losses \textit{alone} may slightly degrade RMSE scores, when trained in combination the model exhibits very similar MSE performance to an MSE-trained model while at the same time significantly improving spectral fidelity and physical consistency. The alternative wind representation further improves wind speed accuracy and reduces directional bias. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of loss function design as a mechanism for embedding domain knowledge into MLWP models and advancing their operational readiness.</description>

      <title>Technical overview and architecture of the FastNet Machine Learning weather prediction model, version 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FastNet version 1.0, a data-driven medium range numerical weather prediction (NWP) model based on a Graph Neural Network architecture, developed jointly between the Alan Turing Institute and the Met Office. FastNet uses an encode-process-decode structure to produce deterministic global weather predictions out to 10 days. The architecture is independent of spatial resolution and we have trained models at 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ resolution, with a six hour time step. FastNet uses a multi-level mesh in the processor, which is able to capture both short-range and long-range patterns in the spatial structure of the atmosphere. The model is pre-trained on ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis data and then fine-tuned on additional autoregressive rollout steps, which improves accuracy over longer time horizons. We evaluate the model performance at 1.5$^{\circ}$ resolution using 2022 as a hold-out year and compare with the Met Office Global Model, finding that FastNet surpasses the skill of the current Met Office Global Model NWP system using a variety of evaluation metrics on a number of atmospheric variables. Our results show that both our 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ FastNet models outperform the current Global Model and produce results with predictive skill approaching those of other data-driven models trained on 0.25$^{\circ}$ ERA5.</description>

      <title>Detection of isolated specular reflection for calibration of cloud thermodynamic phase estimation with quantum parametric mode sorting LIDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Are Deep Learning Methods Suitable for Downscaling Global Climate Projections? An Intercomparison for Temperature and Precipitation over Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance and extrapolation capability of existing models using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein we propose a method mimicking natural processes for the creation of precipitation, rain, in a safe, economically feasible manner anywhere in the world. We propose accomplishing this via changing the target of the well established field of aerosol dispersal for large scale climate cooling from long term cooling to short term, locally targeted dispersal. We show that such should induce precipitation anywhere with sufficient humidity, and should be accomplishable at low cost and low or no safety concerns.</description>

      <title>Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (3-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>
