      <title>Border Bases in the Rational Weyl Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Border bases are a generalization of Gr\"obner bases for polynomial rings. In this article, we introduce border bases for a non-commutative ring of linear differential operators, namely the rational Weyl algebra. We elaborate on their properties and present algorithms to compute with them. We apply this theory to represent integrable connections as cyclic $D$-modules explicitly. As an application, we visit differential equations behind a stringy, a Feynman as well as a cosmological integral. We also address the classification of particular $D$-ideals of a fixed holonomic rank, namely the case of linear PDEs with constant coefficients as well as Frobenius ideals. Our approach rests on the theory of Hilbert schemes of points in affine space.</description>

      <title>Pattern Division Random Access (PDRA) for M2M Communications with Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the pattern-domain pilot design paradigm based on a "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" with significantly larger contention space to enhance the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) random access (RA) performance in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.Specifically, the pattern-domain pilot is constructed based on the superposition of $L$ cyclically-shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The pattern-domain pilots exhibit zero correlation values between non-colliding patterns from the same root and low correlation values between patterns from different roots. The increased contention space, i.e., from N to $\binom{N}{L}$, where $\binom{N}{L}$ denotes the number of all L-combinations of a set N, and low correlation valueslead to a significantly lower pilot collision probability without compromising excessively on channel estimation performance for mMTC RA in massive MIMO systems.We present the framework and analysis of the RA success probability of the pattern-domain based scheme with massive MIMO systems.Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pattern division random access (PDRA) scheme achieves an appreciable performance gain over the conventional one,while preserving the existing physical layer virtually unchanged. The extension of the "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" scheme to "superposition of quasi-orthogonal-building-blocks" is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>
