      <title>Finiteness properties of stabilisers of oligomorphic actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An action of a group on a set is oligomorphic if it has finitely many orbits of $n$-element subsets for all $n$. We prove that for a large class of groups (including all groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension and all countable linear groups), for any oligomorphic action of such a group on an infinite set there exists a finite subset whose stabiliser is not of type $\mathrm{FP}_\infty$. This leads to obstructions on finiteness properties for permutational wreath products and twisted Brin-Thompson groups. We also prove a version for actions on flag complexes, and discuss connections to the Boone-Higman conjecture. In the appendix, we improve on the criterion of Bartholdi-Cornulier-Kochloukova for finiteness properties of wreath products, and the criterion of Kropholler-Martino for finiteness properties of graph-wreath products.</description>

      <title>On the heat kernel of a Cayley graph of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain an explicit formula for the heat kernel on the infinite Cayley graph of the modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$, given by the presentation $\langle a,b\mid a^2=1, b^3=1\rangle$. Our approach extends the method of Chung--Yau in~\cite{MR1667452} by observing that the Cayley graph strongly and regularly covers a weighted infinite line. We solve the spectral problem on this line to obtain an integral expression for its heat kernel, and then lift this to the Cayley graph using spectral transfer principles for strongly regular coverings. The explicit formula allows us to determine the Laplace spectrum, containing eigenvalues and continuous parts. As a by-product, we suggest a conjecture on the lower bound for the spectral gap of Cayley graphs of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{F}_p$ with our generators, inspired by the analogy with Selberg's $1/4$-conjecture. Numerical evidence is provided for small primes.</description>

      <title>Isotopisms of quadratic quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasigroup is a pair $(Q, \cdot)$ where $Q$ is a non-empty set and $\cdot$ is a binary operation on $Q$ such that for every $(u, v) \in Q^2$ there exists a unique $(x, y) \in Q^2$ such that $u \cdot x = v = y \cdot u$. Let $q$ be an odd prime power, let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote the finite field of order $q$, and let $\mathcal{R}_q$ denote the set of non-zero squares in $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\{a, b\} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ be such that $\{ab, (a-1)(b-1)\} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_q$. Let $\mathcal{Q}_{a, b}$ denote the quadratic quasigroup $(\mathbb{F}_q, *_{a, b})$ where $*_{a, b}$ is defined by
  \[ \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  x+a(y-x) &amp; \text{if } y-x \in \mathcal{R}_q,\\ x+b(y-x) &amp; \text{otherwise}.
  \end{array}
  \right. \] The operation table of a quadratic quasigroup is a quadratic Latin square. Recently, it has been determined exactly when two quadratic quasigroups are isomorphic and the automorphism group of any quadratic quasigroup has been determined. In this paper, we extend these results. We determine exactly when two quadratic quasigroups are isotopic and we determine the autotopism group of any quadratic quasigroup. In the process, we count the number of $2 \times 2$ subsquares in quadratic Latin squares.</description>

Abstract: Let $N_g$ be a closed non-orientable surface of genus $g\geq 3$. Let $\operatorname{Homeo}_0(N_g,\mu)$ be the identity component of the group of measure-preserving homeomorphisms of $N_g$. In this work we prove that the third bounded cohomology of $\operatorname{Homeo}_0(N_g,\mu)$ is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>A computer-friendly construction of the monster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10921v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{M}$ be the monster group which is the largest sporadic finite simple group, and has first been constructed in 1982 by Griess. In 1985, Conway has constructed a 196884-dimensional representation $\rho$ of $\mathbb{M}$ with matrix coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$. So these matrices may be reduced modulo any (not necessarily prime) odd number $p$, leading to representations of $\mathbb{M}$ in odd characteristic. The representation $\rho$ is based on representations of two maximal subgroups $G_{x0}$ and $N_0$ of $\mathbb{M}$. In ATLAS notation, $G_{x0}$ has structure $2_+^{1+24}.\mbox{Co}_1$ and $N_0$ has structure $2^{2+11+22}.( M_{24} \times S_3)$. Conway has constructed an explicit set of generators of $N_0$, but not of $G_{x0}$.
  This paper is essentially a rewrite of Conway's construction augmented by an explicit construction of an element of $G_{x0} \setminus N_0$. This gives us a complete set of generators of $\mathbb{M}$. It turns out that the matrices of all generators of $\mathbb{M}$ consist of monomial blocks, and of blocks which are essentially Hadamard matrices scaled by a negative power of two. Multiplication with such a generator can be programmed very efficiently if the modulus $p$ is of shape $2^k-1$.
  So this paper may be considered a as programmer's reference for Conway's construction of the monster group $\mathbb{M}$. We have implemented representations of $\mathbb{M}$ modulo 3, 7, 15, 31, 127, and 255.</description>

      <title>One-ended spanning subforests and treeability of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that several new classes of groups are measure strongly treeable. In particular, finitely generated groups admitting planar Cayley graphs, elementarily free groups, and the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane and all its closed subgroups. This provides the first examples of one-ended nonamenable groups which are measure strongly treeable. In higher dimensions, we also prove a dichotomy that the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $3$-manifold is either amenable or has strong ergodic dimension $2$. Our main technical tool is a method for finding measurable treeings of Borel planar graphs by constructing one-ended spanning subforests in their planar dual. Our techniques for constructing one-ended spanning subforests also give a complete classification of the locally finite pmp graphs which admit Borel a.e.\ one-ended spanning subforests.</description>

      <title>A Pansiot-type subword complexity theorem for automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Pansiot's work on substitutions, we prove a similar theorem for automorphisms of a free group F of finite rank: if a right-infinite word X represents an attracting fixed point of an automorphism of F, the subword complexity of X is equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2. The proof uses combinatorial arguments analogue to Pansiot's as well as train tracks. We also define the recurrence complexity of X, and we apply it to laminations. In particular, we show that attracting laminations have complexity equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2 (to n if the automorphism is fully irreducible).</description>

      <title>Classification of aut-fixed subgroups in free-abelian times surface groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the direct product $G=\pi_1(\Sigma)\times \Z^k$ for $\Sigma$ a compact orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic, and give a complete classification of its fixed subgroups of automorphisms. As a corollary, we show that $G$ contains, up to isomorphism, infinitely many fixed subgroups of automorphisms if and only if $k\geq 2$, which is a contrast to that of hyperbolic groups. As an application on Nielsen fixed point theory, we provide a family of aspherical manifolds without Jiang's Bound Index Property. Moreover, we also give some results on the fixed subgroups of the direct product $H\times \Z^k$ for $H$ a non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic group.</description>

      <title>Exotic proper actions on homogeneous spaces via convex cocompact representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a series of homogeneous spaces G/H of reductive type which admit proper actions of discrete subgroups of G isomorphic to cocompact lattices of O(n,1) (n=2,3,4) but do not admit proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups of G. The existence of such homogeneous spaces was previously not known even for n=2. Our construction of proper actions of discrete subgroups is based on Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on convex cocompact subgroups of O(n,1) and Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on right-angled Coxeter groups. On the other hand, the non-existence of proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups is proved by the theory of nilpotent orbits and elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <title>On Distinguishing Graphs and Cost Number using Automorphism Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A distinguishing coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring such that only the identity automorphism of the graph preserves the coloring. A 2-distinguishable graph is a graph which can be distinguished using 2 colors. The cost $\rho(G)$ of a 2-distinguishable graph is the smallest size of a color set of a distinguishing coloring of $G$. The determining number of a graph, $Det(G)$, is the minimum number of nodes, which if fixed by a coloring, would ensure that the coloring distinguishes the entire graph.
  Boutin (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 85: 161-171, 2013) posed an open problem which asks if $\rho(G)$ and $Det(G)$ can be arbitrarily far apart. It is trivial that it cannot be so for the case $Det(G) = 1$ but the answer was unknown for $Det(G) \geq 2$. We solve this problem for the case $Det(G) = 2$. We show that for the case $Det(G) = 2$, that not only is the cost bounded but in fact it takes small values with $\rho(G) = 2, \ 3$ or $4$. In order to establish this, the concept of the automorphism representation of a graph is developed. Graphs having equivalent automorphism representations implies that they have the same distinguishing number (note that just having isomorphic automorphism groups is not enough for this to hold). This prompts a factoring of graphs by which two graphs are distinguishably equivalent iff they have equivalent automorphism representations.</description>
