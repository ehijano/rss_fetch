      <title>A minimal model for multigroup adaptive SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the adaptive N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (aNIMFA) model studied in \emph{Achterberg and Sensi} \cite{achterbergsensi2022adaptive} to a heterogeneous network of communities. In particular, the multigroup aNIMFA model describes the impact of both local and global disease awareness on the spread of a disease in a network. We obtain results on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of the basic reproduction number~$R_0$. Under light constraints, we show that the basic reproduction number~$R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number of the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which contrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled out analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is more fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the disease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks with fewer links. Finally, we emphasise that our method of modelling adaptivity is not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Partially rigid motions in the n-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solution of the n-body problem in R^d is a relative equilibrium if all of the mutual distance between the bodies are constant. In other words, the bodies undergo a rigid motion. Here we investigate the possibility of partially rigid motions, where some but not all of the distances are constant. In particular, a {\em hinged} solution is one such that exactly one mutual distance varies. The goal of this paper is to show that hinged solutions don't exist when n=3 or n=4. For n=3 this means that if 2 of the 3 distances are constant so is the third and for n=4, if 5 of the 6 distances are constant, so is the sixth. These results hold independent of the dimension d of the ambient space.</description>

      <title>Stable periodic orbits for delay differential equations with unimodal feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider delay differential equations of the form $ y'(t)=-ay(t)+bf(y(t-1)) $ with positive parameters $a,b$ and a unimodal $f:[0,\infty)\to [0,1]$. It is assumed that the nonlinear $f$ is close to a function $g:[0,\infty)\to [0,1]$ with $g(\xi)=0$ for all $\xi&gt;1$. The fact $g(\xi)=0$ for all $\xi&gt;1$ allows to construct stable periodic orbits for the equation $x'(t)=-cx(t)+dg(x(t-1))$ with some parameters $d&gt;c&gt;0$. Then it is shown that the equation $ y'(t)=-ay(t)+bf(y(t-1)) $ also has a stable periodic orbit provided $a,b,f$ are sufficiently close to $c,d,g$ in a certain sense. The examples include $f(\xi)=\frac{\xi^k}{1+\xi^n}$ for parameters $k&gt;0$ and $n&gt;0$ together with the discontinuous $g(\xi)=\xi^k$ for $\xi\in[0,1)$, and $g(\xi)=0$ for $\xi&gt;1$. The case $k=1$ is the famous Mackey--Glass equation, the case $k&gt;1$ appears in population models with Allee effect, and the case $k\in(0,1)$ arises in some economic growth models. The obtained stable periodic orbits may have complicated structures.</description>

      <title>Most probable escape paths in perturbed gradient systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic systems are used to model a variety of phenomena in which noise plays an essential role. In these models, one potential goal is to determine if noise can induce transitions between states, and if so, to calculate the most probable escape path from an attractor. In the small noise limit, the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations provides a variational framework to calculate these paths. This work focuses on using large deviation theory to calculate such paths for stochastic gradient systems with non-gradient perturbations. While for gradient systems the most probable escape paths consist of time-reversed heteroclinic orbits, for general systems it can be a challenging calculation. By applying Melnikov theory to the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations recast in Hamiltonian form, we determine a condition for when the optimal escape path is the heteroclinic orbit for the perturbed system. We provide a numerical example to illustrate how the computed most probable escape path compares with the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed nonlinear vector autoregressive models for the prediction of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have recently been of great interest for solving differential equations. Training these models is classically a data-fitting task, but knowledge of the expression of the differential equation can be used to supplement the training objective, leading to the development of physics-informed scientific machine learning. In this article, we focus on one class of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR and piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented procedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and ODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict solutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result is that chaos in dimension $n+1$ is a one-dimensional geometrical object embedded in a geometrical object of dimension $n$ which corresponds to a $n$ dimensional object which is either singular or non-singular. Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case as either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this chaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in the non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has chaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore prove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of a semilinear problem in heat conduction with long time memory and non-local diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behavior of a semilinear heat equation with long time memory and non-local diffusion is analyzed in the usual set-up for dynamical systems generated by differential equations with delay terms. This approach is different from the previous published literature on the long time behavior of heat equations with memory which is carried out by the Dafermos transformation. As a consequence, the obtained results provide complete information about the attracting sets for the original problem, instead of the transformed one. In particular, the proved results also generalize and complete previous literature in the local case.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional exponential mixing and ideal kinematic dynamo with randomized ABC flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Lagrangian properties of a random version of the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) in a three-dimensional periodic box. We prove that the associated flow map possesses a positive top Lyapunov exponent and its associated one-point, two-point and projective Markov chains are geometrically ergodic. For a passive scalar, it follows that such a velocity is a space-time smooth exponentially mixing field, uniformly in the diffusivity coefficient. For a passive vector, it provides an example of a universal ideal (i.e. non-diffusive) kinematic dynamo.</description>

      <title>The pruning front conjecture, folding patterns and classification of H\'enon maps in the presence of strange attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological dynamics of H\'enon maps. For a parameter set generalizing the Benedicks-Carleson parameters (the Wang-Young parameter set) we obtain the following:
  The pruning front conjecture (due to Cvitanovi\'c);
  A kneading theory (realizing a conjecture by Benedicks and Carleson);
  A classification: two H\'enon maps are conjugate on their strange attractors if and only if their sets of kneading sequences coincide, if and only if their folding patterns coincide.
  The folding pattern is a single sequence of 0s and 1s, which allows to distinguish two nonconjugate H\'enon attractors in finitely many steps. The classification result relies on further development of the authors' recent inverse limit description of H\'enon attractors in terms of densely branching trees.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the strong relationship between Myrberg type dynamics and the ergodic properties of the geodesic flows on (not necessarily compact) uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points. We prove that the positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is equivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is a full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of the Approximate Analytical Solution of the Surf-Riding Threshold in the IMO Second Generation Intact Stability Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Maritime Organization developed the Second Generation Intact Stability Criteria (SGISC) with the objective of mitigating maritime incidents attributable to roll motion. Given that surf-riding precedes broaching, the SGISC uses vulnerability criteria for broaching based on surf-riding dynamics. The surf-riding threshold is derived by Melnikov's method in the level-2 vulnerability criterion. In this paper, the authors discuss the uniqueness of the approximate analytical solutions to be used as the surf-riding threshold in the SGISC and based on the relationship between Melnikov's analysis and its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>
