      <title>Tunable magnons in a dual-gated 2D antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered antiferromagnet CrSBr features magnons coupled to other quasiparticles, including excitons and polaritons, enabling their easy optical accessibility. In this work, we investigate the tunability of magnons in few-layered devices in response to changes in carrier density and the application of a perpendicular electric field. We demonstrate an on-chip tunability of the in- and out-of-phase magnon frequencies by up to 2 GHz. While the frequencies of both modes increase with the electron density, we observe an asymmetric response with respect to the electric field in a dual-gated trilayer device. To understand the mechanism of this disparity, we develop a layer-resolved macrospin model describing the magnetic dynamics in thin, non-uniformly doped devices. Through this model we establish the doping- and electric-field-dependence of the exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic moment of individual layers. Our results advance the applications of gate-tunable magnonic devices based on 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnon band topology and associated topological edge states (TESs) in Neel-type ferromagnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, using parameters relevant to monolayer CrI3. Employing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and discrete Holstein-Primakoff bosonization, we analyze the impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice structure on the magnonic spectrum, in contrast to the extensively studied triangular spin-lattice SkXs. Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation. These findings underscore the profound role of lattice geometry in shaping magnon topology in non-collinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Q Torsional Nanomechanics through Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was discovered that torsion modes of strained nanoribbons exhibit dissipation dilution, giving a route to enhanced torque sensing and quantum optomechanics experiments. As with all strained nanomechanical resonators, an important limitation is bending loss due to mode curvature at the clamps. Here we use Bayesian optimization to design nanoribbons with optimal dissipation dilution of the fundamental torsion mode. Applied to centimeter-scale Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons, we realize $Q$ factors exceeding 100 million and $Q$-frequency products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. The thermal torque sensitivity of the reported devices is at the level of $10^{-20}\;\text{N}\,\text{m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and the zero point angular displacement spectral density is at the level of $10^{-10}\;\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$; they are moreover simple to fabricate, have high thermal conductivity, and can be heavily mass-loaded without diminishing their $Q$, making them attractive for diverse fundamental and applied weak force sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Highly reliable, ultra-wideband, isolator-free quantum-dot mode-locked frequency combs for optical interconnects beyond 3.2Tb/s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot mode-locked laser-based optical frequency combs are emerging as a critical solution for achieving low-cost, high-efficiency, and large-capacity optical interconnects. The practical implementation of wavelength division multiplexing interconnects necessitates a temperature-stable OFC source with a minimum 100 GHz channel spacing to enable high-bandwidth modulation while mitigating the complexity of optical filtering and detection. By leveraging the advanced co-doping technique and a colliding pulse mode-locking scheme, here, we report a compact, ultra-wideband, highly reliable, isolator-free 100 GHz-spacing InAs/GaAs QD OFC source operating up to a record temperature of 140 {\deg}C. The comb source delivers a record 3 dB optical bandwidth of 14.312 nm, containing flat-top comb lines, each supporting 128 Gb/s PAM-4 modulation, which results in a total throughput of 3.328 Tb/s with an extremely low power consumption of 0.394 pJ/bit at 25{\deg}C. Performance remains stable at 85 {\deg}C, with negligible degradation of device critical metrics. Remarkably, accelerated aging tests under harsh conditions (85 {\deg}C with 8x threshold current injection) revealed a mean time to failure of approximately 207 years. The QD OFC source demonstrated in this work, for the first time, establishes a concrete link between fundamental research on comb sources and their practical deployment in next-generation, high-density optical interconnect systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Current Noise in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes across the Ballistic-Diffusive Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically elucidate the system length ($L$) dependence of phonon-induced current noise in carbon nanotubes at room temperature over a broad range, encompassing the quantum ballistic and classical diffusive regimes. The power spectral density for the current noise is maximally enhanced when $L$ is comparable to the mean free path $L_0$ of an electron. In the ballistic limit of $L/L_0\ll 1$, the power spectral density increases in proportion to $L$, whereas in the diffusive limit of $L/L_0\gg 1$, it shows a power-law decay $L^{-\alpha}$ with a scaling parameter $\alpha=3.81$. The noise decay for single-walled carbon nanotubes is faster than that previously predicted based on a simple model because of the various electron-phonon scattering processes and the complex energy dependence of the phonon relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics in magnetic Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic analogy of the Duffing oscillator--magnetic Duffing oscillator--which is characterized by a double-well magnetic potential of a ferromagnet with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on the linear stability analysis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy field creates an anharmonicity on the magnetic potential, generating homoclinic orbits in the phase space. By evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, we demonstrate that the magnetic Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviors in the presence of periodically oscillating external forces: Oersted field and spin-orbit torque by considering the ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer. We also show that the external magnetic field can be adjusted to generate or modify homoclinic orbits, thereby controlling the parameter range of the oscillating external forces that induce chaos. This work deepens our understanding of chaotic magnetization dynamics by bridging the fields of nonlinear dynamics and spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin-orbit interaction of electrons confined in the outer regions of square core-shell nanowires. The polygonal cross section leads to the accumulation of low-energy electrons in the corners and the formation of a significant energy gap that separates these corner-localized states from higher-energy states localized along the sides. We show that the low-energy states behave like the states of independent quantum wires, while the higher-energy states exhibit features characteristic of coupled wires.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Hybrid Normal-Superconducting Systems: The Role of superconducting coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting systems consisting of one superconducting and two normal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels, focusing on the role of quantum coherence. We first study the simplest setup yielding TUR violations, where the central region is a single-level quantum dot and only one normal lead is connected.
  In addition to the {\it classical} TUR, we consider an alternative formulation recently derived for coherent conductors. We find even the latter TUR is violated (although by a smaller extent) as a result of the macroscopic coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support this conclusion, we connect the second normal lead as a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the dot's pair amplitude. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the quantum-TUR violation.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Helices of Polar Domains in a Quadruple Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant effort in condensed matter physics is dedicated to the search for exotic arrangements of electric dipoles. Beyond collinear alignments of electric dipoles, more complex arrangements analogous to magnetic spin textures, such as polar vortices and skyrmions, have been realized. Here we report atomic-scale visualizations of a candidate for helical texture of electric dipoles, the lightly doped quadruple perovskite BiCu$_{x}$Mn$_{7-x}$O$_{12}$. Rather than forming a continuous incommensurate helical structure, this material exhibits a mesoscale ordering of ferroelastic and polar domains. Across domains, bismuth's polar displacement rotates discretely following a consistent handedness, giving rise to a mesoscale helical pattern. We observe both right-handed and left-handed chiralities associated with helical ordering. The mesoscopic helices of polar order observed in our work would provide an opportunity to realize emergent chiral-optical activity in ferroelectric crystals akin to supramolecular assemblies.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Synthetic crystal rotation with spacetime metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with rotating bodies has been historically limited to rotation frequencies much smaller than optical frequencies. Here, we investigate synthetic crystal rotations, i.e., spatiotemporal modulations mimicking the rotation of an anisotropic crystal, which grant access to large rotation frequencies. Spatiotemporal modulations change the fundamental symmetries of the electromagnetic field, breaking temporal and rotation symmetries, but preserving a spatiotemporal rotation symmetry that enforces the conservation of a combination of energy and spin angular momentum (SAM). The scattering of optical pulses by synthetically rotating crystals results in spatiotemporal light with intra-pulse SAM changes. The frequency-domain response reveals sidebands with frequency/SAM locking, and negative frequency sideband transitions for large enough rotation frequencies. Our results highlight the qualitatively different light-matter interaction regimes accessed by synthetic rotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Hamiltonian of Mean Force and Strong-Coupling Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal thermodynamic framework for quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to thermal environments. Unlike previous approaches, our method enables a clear definition of thermostatic properties while preserving the same gauge freedoms as in the standard weak-coupling regime and retaining the von Neumann expression for thermodynamic entropy. Furthermore, it provides a formulation of general first and second laws using only variables accessible through microscopic control of the system, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility. We validate the framework by applying it to a paradigmatic model of strong coupling with a structured bosonic reservoir.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have been proven effective for essential quantum computation tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum control. Efficient hardware implementation of these algorithms at cryogenic temperatures is essential. Here, we utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic topological memristors) and introduce a cryogenic in-memory computing scheme based on the coexistence of the chiral edge state and the topological surface state. The memristive switching and reading of the giant anomalous Hall effect exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and CMOS technologies. Our results not only showcase a new application of chiral edge states but also may inspire further topological quantum physics-based novel computing schemes.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Strain-Induced Landau Levels in a Graphene - Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields offer the possibility of realizing zero magnetic field Quantum Hall effect in graphene, possibly up to room temperature, representing a promising avenue for lossless charge transport applications. Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Twist Angle Dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Heterostructures beyond the Exciton Mott Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Absolute measurement of the exchange interaction in an InSb quantum well using Landau-level tunnelling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</description>

Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions may fulfill ``holographic'' area laws, since their correlation fractal dimension is \(d_2\approx 2\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. They exhibit completely flat bands at specific values of model parameters indicated by lines in the phase diagrams. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</description>

Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a structural instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. We also observe a remarkable triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate that tunable Coulomb clusters serve as a versatile platform to elucidate the interplay between symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways in structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>

Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>
