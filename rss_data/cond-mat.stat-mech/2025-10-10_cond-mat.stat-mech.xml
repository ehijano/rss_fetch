      <title>Localization of information driven by stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: we show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Continuum Theory of Magnetic Particles in High-Gradient Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particles underpin a broad range of technologies, from water purification and mineral processing to bioseparations and targeted drug delivery. The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic fields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the coupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field feedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on empirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle transport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a free-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and steric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via homogenization theory. The resulting equations unify magnetism, mass transport, and momentum balances without ad hoc shut-off criteria, allowing field shielding, anisotropic deposition, and boundary-layer confinement to emerge naturally. Simulations predict canonical capture morphologies-axially aligned plumes, crescent-shaped deposits, and nonlinear shielding-across field strengths and flow regimes, consistent with trends reported in prior experimental and modeling studies. By organizing captured particle mass data into a dimensionless phase diagram based on the Mason number, we reveal three distinct regimes-thermodynamically controlled, transitional, and dynamically controlled. This perspective provides a predictive platform for in silico optimization and extension to three-dimensional geometries, and informing digital twin development for industrial-scale high-gradient magnetic separation processes.</description>

      <title>What is the most optimal diffusion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the fastest possible "diffusion"? A trivial answer would be "a process that converts a Dirac delta-function into a uniform distribution infinitely fast". Below, we consider a more reasonable formulation: a process that maximizes differential entropy of a probability density function (pdf) $f(\vec{x}, t)$ at every time $t$, under certain restrictions. Specifically, we focus on a case when the rate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\text{KL}}$ is fixed. If $\Delta(\vec{x}, t, d{t}) = \frac{\partial f}{ \partial t} d{t}$ is the pdf change at a time step $d{t}$, we maximize the differential entropy $H[f + \Delta]$ under the restriction $D_{\text{KL}}(f + \Delta || f) = A^2 d{t}^2$, $A = \text{const} &gt; 0$. It leads to the following equation: $\frac{\partial f}{ \partial t} = - \kappa f (\ln{f} - \int f \ln{f} d{\vec{x}})$, with $\kappa = \frac{A}{\sqrt{ \int f \ln^2{f} d{\vec{x}} - \left( \int f \ln{f} d{\vec{x}} \right)^2 } }$. Notably, this is a non-local equation, so the process is different from the It\^{o} diffusion and a corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. We show that the normal and exponential distributions are solutions to this equation, on $(-\infty; \infty)$ and $[0; \infty)$, respectively, both with $\text{variance} \sim e^{2 A t}$, i.e. diffusion is highly anomalous. We numerically demonstrate for sigmoid-like functions on a segment that the entropy change rate $\frac{d H}{d t}$ produced by such an optimal "diffusion" is, as expected, higher than produced by the "classical" diffusion.</description>

      <title>Non-Kramers State Transitions in a Synthetic Toggle Switch Biosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine, we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime, challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions beyond the small-noise assumption.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions Without Instability: A Universal Mechanism from Non-Normal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new universality class of phase transitions that arises in non-normal systems, challenging the classical view that transitions require eigenvalue instabilities. In traditional bifurcation theory, critical phenomena emerge when spectral stability is lost; here, we show that transitions can occur even when all equilibria are spectrally stable. The key mechanism is the transient amplification induced by non-orthogonal eigenvectors: noise-driven dynamics are enhanced not by lowering energy barriers, but by increasing the effective shear of the flow, which renormalizes fluctuations and acts as an emergent temperature. Once the non-normality index $\kappa$ exceeds a critical threshold $\kappa_c$, stable equilibria lose practical relevance, enabling escapes and abrupt transitions despite preserved spectral stability. This pseudo-criticality generalizes Kramers' escape beyond potential barriers, providing a fundamentally new route to critical phenomena. Its implications are broad: in biology, DNA methylation dynamics reconcile long-term epigenetic memory with rapid stochastic switching; in climate, ecology, finance, and engineered networks, abrupt tipping points can arise from the same mechanism. By demonstrating that phase transitions can emerge from non-normal amplification rather than eigenvalue instabilities, we introduce a predictive, compact framework for sudden transitions in complex systems, establishing non-normality as a defining principle of a new universality class of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the current generated by dissipative master equation in single-band tight-binding systems subject to time-dependent uniform electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</description>

      <title>A nonequilibrium distribution for stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical distribution of Gibbs is extended to the case of systems outside equilibrium. The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of one-dimensional stochastic dynamics with small inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and coding transitions of Haar-random quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of hybrid systems -- i.e. ones in which classical and quantum degrees of freedom co-exist and interact -- feature both diffusion in the classical sector and decoherence in the quantum state. In this article, we will consider the simple setup of a classical damped oscillator interacting with its quantum counterpart and show that, for any initial state, the dynamics flows to a unique (non-equilibrium) steady state, which we compute explicitly. To do so, we make use of a useful mapping between hybrid and classical diffusive dynamics, which we characterise in detail in the master equation formalism.</description>

      <title>Compounding formula approach to chromatin and active polymer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active polymers are ubiquitous in nature, and often kicked by persistent noises that break detailed balance. In order to capture the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of such active polymers, we propose a simple yet reliable analytical framework based on a compounding formula. Connecting polymeric dynamics to the isolated monomeric behavior via the notion of tension propagation, the formula allows us to clarify rich scaling scenarios alongside corresponding intuitive physical pictures. We demonstrate distinctive transient and steady-state scalings due to the non-Markovian nature of the active noise. Aside from a paradigmatic example of an active Rouse polymer, we expect the framework to be applicable to wide variety of spatially extended systems including more general polymers (crumpled globule, semiflexible polymers etc), fluctuation of growing interface, and an array of particles in single-file configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Flow Coupling Alters Topological Phase Transition in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how coupling to fluid flow influences defect-mediated transitions in two-dimensional passive nematic fluids using fluctuating nematohydrodynamic simulations. The system is driven by tuning the fluctuation strength, with increasing (decreasing) fluctuations defining the forward (backward) protocol. In the absence of flow coupling, the transition follows the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) scenario, governed by reversible binding and unbinding of $\pm 1/2$ defect pairs. When hydrodynamics is included, the outcome is controlled by the flow--alignment parameter. For non-aligning nematics ($\lambda=0$), the transition remains consistent with BKT. By contrast, for strain-rate--aligning nematics ($\lambda\neq 0$), bend--splay walls emerge, lowering the defect nucleation threshold and preventing sustained recombination: once created, defects remain unbound across the full range of fluctuation strengths in both forward and backward protocols. These results identify flow alignment as a fundamental control parameter for topological phase behavior and suggest that the canonical BKT transition emerges only in the absence of flow alignment.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries from Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries that conserve energy</title>

Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quenching, Fast and Slow: Breaking Kibble-Zurek Universal Scaling by Jumping along Geodesics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Structural Theory of Quantum Metastability: Markov Properties and Area Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</description>

Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</description>

Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>

Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function by constructing a kernel representation of the Primon gas based on a finite p-base, thereby establishing a concrete link between number theory and kernel theory.</description>

      <title>The non-stabilizerness of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program.
  From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>
