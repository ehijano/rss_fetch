      <title>Locally sparse varying coefficient mixed model with application to longitudinal microbiome differential abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential abundance (DA) analysis in microbiome studies has recently been used to uncover a plethora of associations between microbial composition and various health conditions. While current approaches to DA typically apply only to cross-sectional data, many studies feature a longitudinal design to better understand the underlying microbial dynamics. To study DA in longitudinal microbial studies, we introduce a novel varying coefficient mixed-effects model with local sparsity. The proposed method can identify time intervals of significant group differences while accounting for temporal dependence. Specifically, we exploit a penalized kernel smoothing approach for parameter estimation and include a random effect to account for serial correlation. In particular, our method operates effectively regardless of whether sampling times are shared across subjects, accommodating irregular sampling and missing observations. Simulation studies demonstrate the necessity of modeling dependence for precise estimation and support recovery. The application of our method to a longitudinal study of mice oral microbiome during cancer development revealed significant scientific insights that were otherwise not discernible through cross-sectional analyses.

      <title>On the use of cross-fitting in causal machine learning with correlated units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In causal machine learning, the fitting and evaluation of nuisance models are typically performed on separate partitions, or folds, of the observed data. This technique, called cross-fitting, eliminates bias introduced by the use of black-box predictive algorithms. When study units may be correlated, such as in spatial, clustered, or time-series data, investigators often design bespoke forms of cross-fitting to minimize correlation between folds. We prove that, perhaps contrary to popular belief, this is typically unnecessary: performing cross-fitting as if study units were independent usually still eliminates key bias terms even when units may be correlated. In simulation experiments with various correlation structures, we show that causal machine learning estimators typically have the same or improved bias and precision under cross-fitting that ignores correlation compared to techniques striving to eliminate correlation between folds.</description>

      <title>Generalized Heterogeneous Functional Model with Applications to Large-scale Mobile Health Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical activity is crucial for human health. With the increasing availability of large-scale mobile health data, strong associations have been found between physical activity and various diseases. However, accurately capturing this complex relationship is challenging, possibly because it varies across different subgroups of subjects, especially in large-scale datasets. To fill this gap, we propose a generalized heterogeneous functional method which simultaneously estimates functional effects and identifies subgroups within the generalized functional regression framework. The proposed method captures subgroup-specific functional relationships between physical activity and diseases, providing a more nuanced understanding of these associations. Additionally, we develop a pre-clustering method that enhances computational efficiency for large-scale data through a finer partition of subjects compared to true subgroups. We further introduce a testing procedure to assess whether the different subgroups exhibit distinct functional effects. In the real data application, we examine the impact of physical activity on the risk of dementia using the UK Biobank dataset, which includes over 96,433 participants. Our proposed method outperforms existing methods in future-day prediction accuracy, identifying three distinct subgroups, with detailed scientific interpretations for each subgroup. We also demonstrate the theoretical consistency of our methods. Codes implementing the proposed method are available at: https://github.com/xiaojing777/GHFM.</description>

      <title>Robust $M$-Estimation of Scatter Matrices via Precision Structure Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maronna's and Tyler's $M$-estimators are among the most widely used robust estimators for scatter matrices. However, when the dimension of observations is relatively high, their performance can substantially deteriorate in certain situations, particularly in the presence of clustered outliers. To address this issue, we propose an estimator that shrinks the estimated precision matrix toward the identity matrix. We derive a sufficient condition for its existence, discuss its statistical interpretation, and establish upper and lower bounds for its breakdown point. Numerical experiments confirm robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>TSQCA: Threshold-Sweep Qualitative Comparative Analysis in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) requires researchers to choose calibration and dichotomization thresholds, and these choices can substantially affect truth tables, minimization, and resulting solution formulas. Despite this dependency, threshold sensitivity is often examined only in an ad hoc manner because repeated analyses are time-intensive and error-prone. We present TSQCA, an R package that automates threshold-sweep analyses by treating thresholds as explicit analytical variables. It provides four sweep functions (otSweep, ctSweepS, ctSweepM, dtSweep) to explore outcome thresholds, single-condition thresholds, multi-condition threshold grids, and joint outcome-condition threshold spaces, respectively. TSQCA integrates with the established CRAN package QCA for truth table construction and Boolean minimization, while returning structured S3 objects with consistent print/summary methods and optional detailed results. The package also supports automated Markdown report generation and configuration-chart output to facilitate reproducible documentation of cross-threshold results.</description>

      <title>Estimation of time series by Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two minimum distance estimators for dependent data by minimizing some approximated Maximum Mean Discrepancy distances between the true empirical distribution of observations and their assumed (parametric) model distribution. When the latter one is intractable, it is approximated by simulation, allowing to accommodate most dynamic processes with latent variables. We derive the non-asymptotic and the large sample properties of our estimators in the context of absolutely regular/beta-mixing random elements. Our simulation experiments illustrate the robustness of our procedures to model misspecification, particularly in comparison with alternative standard estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Deriving Complete Constraints in Hidden Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden variable graphical models can sometimes imply constraints on the observable distribution that are more complex than simple conditional independence relations. These observable constraints can falsify assumptions of the model that would otherwise be untestable due to the unobserved variables and can be used to constrain estimation procedures to improve statistical efficiency. Knowing the complete set of observable constraints is thus ideal, but this can be difficult to determine in many settings. In models with categorical observed variables and a joint distribution that is completely characterized by linear relations to the unobservable response function variables, we develop a systematic method for deriving the complete set of observable constraints. We illustrate the method in several new settings, including ones that imply both inequality and equality constraints.</description>

      <title>Action Shapley: A Training Data Selection Metric for World Model in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on Sub-Cauchy Projection, a geometric transformation that generalizes stereographic projection by mapping Euclidean space into a spherical cap of a hyper-sphere, referred to as the complement of the dark side of the moon. We prove that our proposed method is uniformly ergodic for sub-Cauchy targets, namely targets whose tails are at most as heavy as a multidimensional Cauchy distribution, and show empirically its performance for challenging high-dimensional problems. The simplicity and broad applicability of our approach open new opportunities for Bayesian modeling and computation with heavy-tailed distributions in settings where most existing methods are unreliable.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Ergodicity Transformations in Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series often exhibit non-ergodic behaviour that complicates forecasting and inference. This article proposes a likelihood-based approach for estimating ergodicity transformations that addresses such challenges. The method is broadly compatible with standard models, including Gaussian processes, ARMA, and GARCH. A detailed simulation study using geometric and arithmetic Brownian motion demonstrates the ability of the approach to recover known ergodicity transformations. A further case study on the large macroeconomic database FRED-QD shows that incorporating ergodicity transformations can provide meaningful improvements over conventional transformations or naive specifications in applied work.</description>

      <title>When Are Two Scores Better Than One? Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Selecting Relevant External Data (BASE): Application to a study of Long-Term Outcomes in a Hemophilia Gene Therapy Trial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene therapies aim to address the root causes of diseases, particularly those stemming from rare genetic defects that can be life-threatening or severely debilitating. Although an increasing number of gene therapies have received regulatory approvals in recent years, understanding their long-term efficacy in trials with limited follow-up time remains challenging. To address this critical question, we propose a novel Bayesian framework designed to selectively integrate relevant external data with internal trial data to improve the inference of the durability of long-term efficacy. We proved that the proposed method has desired theoretical properties, such as identifying and favoring external subsets deemed relevant, where the relevance is defined as the similarity, induced by the marginal likelihood, between the generating mechanisms of the internal data and the selected external data. We also conducted comprehensive simulations to evaluate its performance under various scenarios. Furthermore, we apply this method to predict and infer the endogenous factor IX (FIX) levels of patients who receive Etranacogene dezaparvovec over the long-term. Our estimated long-term FIX levels, validated by recent trial data, indicate that Etranacogene dezaparvovec induces sustained FIX production. Together, the theoretical findings, simulation results, and successful application of this framework underscore its potential to address similar long-term effectiveness estimation and inference questions in real world applications.</description>

      <title>Low-order outcomes and clustered designs: combining design and analysis for causal inference under network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance reduction for causal inference in the presence of network interference is often achieved through either outcome modeling, typically analyzed under unit-randomized Bernoulli designs, or clustered experimental designs, typically analyzed without strong parametric assumptions. In this work, we study the intersection of these two approaches and make the following threefold contributions. First, we present an estimator of the total treatment effect (or global average treatment effect) in low-order outcome models when the data are collected under general experimental designs, generalizing previous results for Bernoulli designs. We refer to this estimator as the pseudoinverse estimator and give bounds on its bias and variance in terms of properties of the experimental design. Second, we evaluate these bounds for the case of Bernoulli graph cluster randomized (GCR) designs. Its variance scales like the smaller of the variance obtained by the estimator derived under a low-order assumption, and the variance obtained from cluster randomization, showing that combining these variance reduction strategies is preferable to using either individually. When the order of the potential outcomes model is correctly specified, our estimator is always unbiased, and under a misspecified model, we upper bound the bias by the closeness of the ground truth model to a low-order model. Third, we give empirical evidence that our variance bounds can be used to select a good clustering that minimizes the worst-case variance under a cluster randomized design from a set of candidate clusterings. Across a range of graphs and clustering algorithms, our method consistently selects clusterings that perform well on a range of response models, suggesting the practical use of our bounds.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric approximations of posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popular deterministic approximations of posterior distributions from, e.g. the Laplace method, variational Bayes and expectation-propagation, generally rely on symmetric approximating families, often taken to be Gaussian. This choice facilitates optimization and inference, but typically affects the quality of the overall approximation. In fact, even in basic parametric models, the posterior distribution often displays asymmetries that yield bias and a reduced accuracy when considering symmetric approximations. Recent research has moved towards more flexible approximating families which incorporate skewness. However, current solutions are often model specific, lack a general supporting theory, increase the computational complexity of the optimization problem, and do not provide a broadly applicable solution to incorporate skewness in any symmetric approximation. This article addresses such a gap by introducing a general and provably optimal strategy to perturb any off-the-shelf symmetric approximation of a generic posterior distribution. This novel perturbation scheme is derived without additional optimization steps, and yields a similarly tractable approximation within the class of skew-symmetric densities that provably enhances the finite sample accuracy of the original symmetric counterpart. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, it improves the convergence rate to the exact posterior by at least a $\sqrt{n}$ factor, in asymptotic regimes. These advancements are illustrated in numerical studies focusing on skewed perturbations of state-of-the-art Gaussian approximations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Time-Varying Meta-Analysis via Hierarchical Mean-Variance Random-effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-analysis is widely used to integrate results from multiple experiments to obtain generalized insights. Since meta-analysis datasets are often heteroscedastic due to varying subgroups and temporal heterogeneity arising from experiments conducted at different time points, the typical meta-analysis approach, which assumes homoscedasticity, fails to adequately address this heteroscedasticity among experiments. This paper proposes a new Bayesian estimation method that simultaneously shrinks estimates of the means and variances of experiments using a hierarchical Bayesian approach while accounting for time effects through a Gaussian process. This method connects experiments via the hierarchical framework, enabling "borrowing strength" between experiments to achieve high-precision estimates of each experiment's mean. The method can flexibly capture potential time trends in datasets by modeling time effects with the Gaussian process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation studies and illustrate its practical utility using a real marketing promotions dataset.</description>

Abstract: An important task in the statistical analysis of inhomogeneous point processes is to investigate the influence of a set of covariates on the point-generating mechanism. In this article, we consider the nonparametric Bayesian approach to this problem, assuming that $n$ independent and identically distributed realizations of the point pattern and the covariate random field are available. In many applications, different covariates are often vastly diverse in physical nature, resulting in anisotropic intensity functions whose variations along distinct directions occur at different smoothness levels. To model this scenario, we employ hierarchical prior distributions based on multi-bandwidth Gaussian processes. We prove that the resulting posterior distributions concentrate around the ground truth at optimal rate as $n\to\infty$, and achieve automatic adaptation to the anisotropic smoothness. Posterior inference is concretely implemented via a Metropolis-within-Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that incorporates a dimension-robust sampling scheme to handle the functional component of the proposed nonparametric Bayesian model. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulation studies. Further, we present an application to the analysis of a Canadian wildfire dataset.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference under Threshold Manipulation: Bayesian Mixture Modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19814</link>

Abstract: Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer rewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage increased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on customers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although regression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference tasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds, strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under threshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending distribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers strategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those unaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach consisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a sample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting posterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate heterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable inference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.</description>

      <title>Prediction Intervals for Interim Events in Randomized Clinical Trials with Time-to-Event Endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-to-event endpoints are central to evaluate treatment efficacy across many disease areas. Many trial protocols include interim analyses within group-sequential designs that control type I error via spending functions or boundary methods, with operating characteristics determined by the number of looks and the information accrued. Planning interim analyses with time-to-event endpoints is challenging because statistical information depends on the number of observed events, so adequate follow-up to accrue the required events is critical and interim prediction of information at scheduled looks and at the final analysis becomes essential. While several methods have been developed to predict the calendar time required to reach a target number of events, to the best of our knowledge there is no established framework that addresses the prediction of the number of events at a future date with corresponding prediction intervals. Starting from prediction interval approach originally developed in reliability engineering for the number of future component failures, we reformulated and extended it to the context of interim monitoring in clinical trials. This adaptation yields a general framework for event-count prediction intervals in the clinical setting, taking the patient as the unit of analysis and accommodating a range of parametric survival models, patient-level covariates, stagged entry and possible dependence between entry dates and loss to follow-up. Prediction intervals are obtained in a frequentist framework from a bootstrap estimator of the conditional distribution of future events. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated via simulation studies and illustrated by analyzing a real-world phase III trial in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.</description>

      <title>Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of \textit{labelled} data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a metric for comparing conditional distributions, and derive a closed form estimator. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from cubic to linear. Leveraging this, we extend KH to propose Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm for constructing compressed sets that target the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), an adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we also propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cyclic Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.</description>

      <title>Pivotal inference for linear predictions in stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop pivotal inference for the final (FPE) and relative final prediction error (RFPE) of linear forecasts in stationary processes. Our approach is based on a self-normalizing technique and avoids the estimation of the asymptotic variances of the empirical autocovariances. We provide pivotal confidence intervals for the (R)FPE, develop estimates for the minimal order of a linear prediction that is required to obtain a prespecified forecasting accuracy and also propose (pivotal) statistical tests for the hypotheses that the (R)FPE exceeds a given threshold. Additionally, we provide pivotal uncertainty quantification for the commonly used coefficient of determination $R^2$ obtained from a linear prediction based on the past $p \geq 1$ observations and develop new (pivotal) inference tools for the partial autocorrelation, which do not require the assumption of an autoregressive process.</description>
