      <title>Charge Modulation in the Vortex Halo of a Superconductor Enhances its Critical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an orbital magnetic field suppresses superconductivity, forming periodic vortices in type-II superconductors, subdominant orders can emerge in the vortex cores. Rather than competing with superconductivity, we find that the emergent charge order within the halo of a vortex makes superconductivity more robust by enhancing the upper critical field. We establish that charge modulations nucleate in and around the vortex core for model parameters dictated by the underlying non-superconducting state. We further show that the spectral signatures from the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states in vortex cores track the charge modulation. The CdGM-like peak is found to shift toward the gap edge and oscillate from particle-to-hole bias from site to site, signaling charge modulation.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Ni-O-Ni Bond Angles as Structural Fingerprints of Superconductivity in Layered Nickelates: Effects of Pressure, Strain, Layering, and Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic conditions conducive to superconductivity in layered nickelates using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$). For both the bilayer and 1-3 polymorphs of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find that the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles under pressure strongly correlate with the experimentally observed superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) dome, and may serve as a reasonable proxy. Under compressive strain, the bond angles straighten, peaking near 2\% strain-consistent with experimental reports of superconductivity in strained bilayer thin films. However, the bond angles at this strain are more bent than those achieved under hydrostatic pressure, correlating with a lower $T_c$. We show that increasing the number of NiO$_2$ layers, as in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, or substituting heavier rare-earth elements (e.g., Pr) raises the pressure required to reach the structural configuration associated with superconductivity. Our results indicate that these systems require higher external pressure to achieve in-plane bond straightening. Varying the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ reveals that stronger electronic correlations delay the structural transition and favor high-spin states. This suggests that moderate correlation strength may be optimal for superconductivity, with stronger correlation preventing the formation of favorable bond geometries. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni $e_g$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level and shift downward with pressure, enhancing Ni-O hybridization. These results highlight how pressure and strain tune structural features that may be essential for engineering high-$T_c$ phases in nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Antichiral edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in a two-dimensional proximity-induced superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Gapless neutron superfluidity in the crust of the accreting neutron stars KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of the thermal evolution of the transiently accreting neutron stars MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 after an outburst is challenging, both within the traditional deep-crustal heating paradigm and the thermodynamically consistent approach of Gusakov and Chugunov that accounts for neutron diffusion throughout the crust. All these studies assume that the neutron superfluid in the crust is at rest. However, we have recently shown that a finite superflow could exist and could lead to a new gapless superfluid phase if quantized vortices are pinned. We have revisited the cooling of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 and we have found that gapless superfluidity could naturally explain their late time cooling. We pursue here our investigation by performing new simulations of the thermal relaxation of the crust of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method accounting for neutron diffusion and allowing for gapless superfluidity. We have varied the global structure of the neutron star, the composition of the heat-blanketing envelope, and the mass accretion rate. In all cases, observations are best fitted by models with gapless superfluidity. Finally, we make predictions that could be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''. This $J_1-J_2$ system may be realized in materials and engineered in quantum circuits, optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$ have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the $\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</description>

      <title>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</description>
