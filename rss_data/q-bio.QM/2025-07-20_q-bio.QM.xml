      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Transformer-based language models for Protein Sequence Analysis and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of Transformer-based language models has been unprecedented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The success of such models has also led to their adoption in other fields including bioinformatics. Taking this into account, this paper discusses recent advances in Transformer-based models for protein sequence analysis and design. In this review, we have discussed and analysed a significant number of works pertaining to such applications. These applications encompass gene ontology, functional and structural protein identification, generation of de novo proteins and binding of proteins. We attempt to shed light on the strength and weaknesses of the discussed works to provide a comprehensive insight to readers. Finally, we highlight shortcomings in existing research and explore potential avenues for future developments. We believe that this review will help researchers working in this field to have an overall idea of the state of the art in this field, and to orient their future studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pathology Foundation Models for Panoptic Segmentation of Melanoma in H&amp;E Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&amp;E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability. Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational pathology workflows.</description>
