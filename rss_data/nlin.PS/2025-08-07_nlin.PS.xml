      <title>The Glider Equation for Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature Measurement via Time Crystal Frequencies in One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for temperature measurement by analyzing the frequency of generated time crystals in one-dimensional (1D) quantum droplets. The system consists of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture confined in a driven quasi-periodic optical lattice (QOL) with repulsive cubic effective mean-field and attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field interactions. By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization.</description>
