      <title>Beyond Diagonal Noise: A Better Predator-Prey Modeling Framework with Cross-Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of stochasticity into continuous ecological models frequently relies on phenomenological, diagonal diffusion terms that lack a rigorous microscopic basis. We demonstrate that this standard practice fundamentally misrepresents the geometry of demographic fluctuations. By deriving a stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur model directly from an integer-valued, Bernoulli-coupled continuous-time Markov chain, we isolate the exact diffusion covariance structure dictated by event stoichiometry. We mathematically prove that coupled predation--conversion events inherently generate a structurally negative predator--prey cross-covariance, exposing the severe mathematical and biological limitations of standard diagonal-noise approximations. Furthermore, we resolve a persistent ambiguity in stochastic population modeling by explicitly formalizing the bifurcation between open-domain formulations (for survival-conditioned interior dynamics) and absorbed formulations (for extinction-permitting dynamics). To rigorously support this distinction, we develop a tailored two-stage Lyapunov well-posedness architecture that separates non-explosion criteria from boundary-barrier positivity invariance. By bridging microscopic event stoichiometry with macroscopic boundary-degenerate diffusions, this work replaces ad hoc noise constructs with a definitive, mathematically exact template for covariance-consistent and boundary-aware ecological modeling.</description>

      <title>The selfish ribosome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribosome is responsible for protein synthesis in all cells, and is the largest energy consumer in the cell. We propose that the ribosome originated as a mutualistic symbiont of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ribozyme, supplying peptides that enhanced replication. As life transitioned from the RNA to the RNA-protein world, autonomous replicators became irreversibly addicted to the ribosome for producing replication proteins. Subsequent evolution is construed as a ribosomal takeover, whereby the ribosome evolved to consume most of the resources of the cell, while other cellular componentry ensured the propagation of the ribosome. Under this perspective, the ribosome is the ultimate biological selfish element.</description>

      <title>Learning Contact Policies for SEIR Epidemics on Networks: A Mean-Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mean-field game model for SEIR epidemics on heterogeneous contact networks, where individuals choose state-dependent contact effort to balance infection losses against the social and economic costs of isolation. The Nash equilibrium is characterized by a coupled Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman/Kolmogorov system across degree classes. An important feature of the SEIR setting is the exposed compartment: the incubation period separates infection from infectiousness and changes incentives after infection occurs. In the baseline formulation, exposed agents optimally maintain full contact, while susceptible agents reduce contact according to an explicit best-response rule driven by infection pressure and the value gap. We also discuss extensions that yield nontrivial exposed precaution by introducing responsibility or compliance incentives. We establish existence of equilibrium via a fixed-point argument and prove the uniqueness under a suitable monotonicity condition. The analysis identifies a delay in the onset of precaution under longer incubation, which can lead to weaker behavioral responses and larger outbreaks. Numerical experiments illustrate how network degree and the cost exponent shape equilibrium policies and epidemic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Prior Knowledge-enhanced Spatio-temporal Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at one provincial CDC in China to facilitate downstream applications.</description>

      <title>A kernel for the maximum agreement forest problem on multiple binary phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum agreement forest (MAF) problem in phylogenetics takes as input a set t &gt;=2 of binary phylogenetic trees T on the same set of taxa X. It asks for a partition X into the smallest number of blocks such that the subtrees induced by these blocks are disjoint and have common topology across all the trees in T. We produce a modified version of the well-known chain reduction rule in order to prove the existence of a kernel of size O( t * r * k ) where k is the natural parameter (the number of blocks) and r=min{max{k,3},t+1}}. We prove this bound for both the unrooted and rooted version of the problem, and demonstrate that the bound r, the length to which common chains are truncated, is tight. Our results constitute the first kernels for MAF in the t &gt; 2 regime.</description>

      <title>Branching random walks with ageing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branching processes are models used to describe populations that reproduce and die over time. In the classical setting, an individual's reproductive capacity remains constant throughout its lifetime. However, in real-world situations, reproductive capacity typically undergoes ageing - that is, after reaching a peak, it decreases over time. In this work, we study the influence of ageing on the behaviour of the process and how modifying its parameters, along with reproduction rates, affects the destiny of the process.</description>

      <title>A Single Equation Explains Go-or-Grow Dynamics in Cyclic Hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal mathematical framework to describe the go-or-grow dynamics of tumor cells comprising two phenotypically distinct populations. One population is migratory and undergoes linear diffusion, while the other proliferates in an oxygen-dependent manner. The local oxygen concentration governs transitions between these phenotypes. We then ask whether these two coupled phenotype-specific equations can be reduced to a single mixed-phenotype equation under cyclic hypoxia. We establish a connection between the minimal go-or-grow model with distinct phenotypic populations and a reduced model describing a single-cell population with oxygen-dependent diffusion and proliferation in the fast-phenotypic-switching regime. This theoretical reduction is validated through numerical simulations.</description>
