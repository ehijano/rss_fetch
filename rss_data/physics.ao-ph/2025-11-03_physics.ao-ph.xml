      <title>AI-boosted rare event sampling to characterize extreme weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and understanding how climate change affects them, is crucial for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, observational datasets are too short and physics-based global climate models (GCMs) are too computationally expensive to obtain robust statistics for the rarest, yet most impactful, extreme events. AI-based emulators have shown promise for predictions at weather and even climate timescales, but they struggle on extreme events with few or no examples in their training dataset. Rare event sampling (RES) algorithms have previously demonstrated success for some extreme events, but their performance depends critically on a hard-to-identify "score function", which guides efficient sampling by a GCM. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, AI+RES, which uses ensemble forecasts of an AI weather emulator as the score function to guide highly efficient resampling of the GCM and generate robust (physics-based) extreme weather statistics and associated dynamics at 30-300x lower cost. We demonstrate AI+RES on mid-latitude heatwaves, a challenging test case requiring a score function with predictive skill many days in advance. AI+RES, which synergistically integrates AI, RES, and GCMs, offers a powerful, scalable tool for studying extreme events in climate science, as well as other disciplines in science and engineering where rare events and AI emulators are active areas of research.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Deep Learning Model for Predicting Pedestrian-Level Urban Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based surrogate models offer a computationally efficient alternative to high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for predicting urban wind flow. However, conventional approaches usually only yield low-frequency predictions (essentially averaging values from proximate pixels), missing critical high-frequency details such as sharp gradients and peak wind speeds. This study proposes a hierarchical approach for accurately predicting pedestrian-level urban winds, which adopts a two-stage predictor-refiner framework. In the first stage, a U-Net architecture generates a baseline prediction from urban geometry. In the second stage, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) refines this baseline by restoring the missing high-frequency content. The cGAN's generator incorporates a multi-scale architecture with stepwise kernel sizes, enabling simultaneous learning of global flow structures and fine-grained local features. Trained and validated on the UrbanTALES dataset with comprehensive urban configurations, the proposed hierarchical framework significantly outperforms the baseline predictor. With a marked qualitative improvement in resolving high-speed wind jets and complex turbulent wakes as well as wind statistics, the results yield quantitative enhancement in prediction accuracy (e.g., RMSE reduced by 76% for the training set and 60% for the validation set). This work presents an effective and robust methodology for enhancing the prediction fidelity of surrogate models in urban planning, pedestrian comfort assessment, and wind safety analysis. The proposed model will be integrated into an interactive web platform as Feilian Version 2.</description>

      <title>Using data assimilation tools to dissect GraphDOP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Data Assimilation (DA) community has been developing various diagnostics to understand the importance of the observing system in accurately forecasting the weather. They usually rely on the ability to compute the derivatives of the physical model output with respect to its initial condition. For example, the Forecast Sensitivity-based Observation Impact (FSOI) estimates the impact on the forecast error of each observation processed in the DA system. This paper presents how these DA diagnostic tools are transferred to Machine Learning (ML) models, as their derivatives are readily available through automatic differentiation. We specifically explore the interpretability and explainability of the observation-driven GraphDOP model developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The interpretability study demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphDOP's sliding attention window to learn the meteorological features present in the observation datasets and to learn the spatial relationships between different regions. Making these relationships more transparent confirms that GraphDOP captures real, physically meaningful processes, such as the movement of storm systems. The explainability of GraphDOP is explored by applying the FSOI tool to study the impact of the different observations on the forecast error. This inspection reveals that GraphDOP creates an internal representation of the Earth system by combining the information from conventional and satellite observations.</description>

      <title>Spatial Controls of Lower Tropospheric Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine low clouds play a crucial role in Earth's radiation budget. These clouds efficiently reflect sunlight and drive the magnitude and sign of the global cloud feedback. Despite their relevance, the evolution of shallow cloud decks over the last decades is not well understood. One of the dominant controls of this low cloud cover is the lower tropospheric stability, quantified by the estimated inversion strength (EIS). Here, we quantify how regional EIS depends on local and remote surface temperature, revealing the dynamics controlling the characteristics of shallow clouds. We find that global EIS increases with warming in tropical regions of ascent and decreases with warming in regions of descent, as expected. In addition to the West Pacific Warm Pool, the Atlantic convection regions and the central Pacific are important predictors. Focusing on subtropical ocean upwelling regions in different ocean basins, where the low cloud decks reside, EIS increases with a fairly complex pattern of remote warming and decreases with local warming. The spatial relationship between surface temperature and EIS is robust across different climate models and reanalyses, allowing us to constrain the large spread in estimates of historical EIS trends. In the Southeast Pacific, where historical temperature trends are not well understood, we attribute the observed increased EIS since 1980 entirely to remote warming, indicating that local cooling did not increase stability in this region. Our results put into question the dominance of the West Pacific Warm Pool in controlling low cloud feedbacks in the eastern Pacific and give insights into mechanisms underlying the spatial dependence of radiative feedbacks on surface temperature patterns.</description>

      <title>A generalisation of the signal-to-noise ratio using proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalised concept of the signal-to-noise ratio (or equivalently the ratio of predictable components, or RPC) is provided, based on proper scoring rules. This definition is the natural generalisation of the classical RPC, yet it allows one to define and analyse the signal-to-noise properties of any type of forecast that is amenable to scoring, thus drastically widening the applicability of these concepts. The methodology is illustrated for ensemble forecasts, scored using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), and for probability forecasts of a binary event, scored using the logarithmic score. Numerical examples are demonstrated using synthetic data with prescribed signal-to-noise ratios as well as seasonal ensemble hindcasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. For the synthetic data, the RPC statistic as well as the scoring rule--based ones agree regarding which data sets exhibit anomalous signal-to-noise ratios, but exhibit different variance, indicating different statistical properties. For the NAO data, on the other hand, the results among the different statistics are more equivocal.</description>
