      <title>Vortex-p: a Helmholtz-Hodge and Reynolds decomposition algorithm for particle-based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical turbulent flows display an intrinsically multi-scale nature, making their numerical simulation and the subsequent analyses of simulated data a complex problem. In particular, two fundamental steps in the study of turbulent velocity fields are the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (compressive+solenoidal; HHD) and the Reynolds decomposition (bulk+turbulent; RD). These problems are relatively simple to perform numerically for uniformly-sampled data, such as the one emerging from Eulerian, fix-grid simulations; but their computation is remarkably more complex in the case of non-uniformly sampled data, such as the one stemming from particle-based or meshless simulations. In this paper, we describe, implement and test vortex-p, a publicly available tool evolved from the vortex code, to perform both these decompositions upon the velocity fields of particle-based simulations, either from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), moving-mesh or meshless codes. The algorithm relies on the creation of an ad-hoc adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) set of grids, on which the input velocity field is represented. HHD is then addressed by means of elliptic solvers, while for the RD we adapt an iterative, multi-scale filter. We perform a series of idealised tests to assess the accuracy, convergence and scaling of the code. Finally, we present some applications of the code to various SPH and meshless finite-mass (MFM) simulations of galaxy clusters performed with OpenGadget3, with different resolutions and physics, to showcase the capabilities of the code.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Very Large Array Memo #122: Characterization of the synthesized beam with and without MID antennas in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesized beam (PSF) synthetic observations with and without the antennas in Mexico are analyzed. For a simple continuum observing setup, we generated visibility files and their associated PSF images for a grid of parameters (robust weighting, tapering, and declination). The tests were done for both the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations and their cropped versions without antennas in Mexico. We show that the performance of the Array, in terms of the beam properties, is in general significantly better when both the MID array antennas are present in Northern Mexico and observations target southern sources. At a declination of -40 deg, there are increments in the ellipticity of at least ~1.3X and 1.2X for a tapering of 3.0 and 4.0 mas, if the antennas in Mexico are not included. For the parameter space tested, the changes in ellipticity of the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations differ by ~10%. Larger tapering values help to reduce the ellipticity for cropped configurations at all declinations, but it will impose more constraints in terms of angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Modeling quasar variability through self-organizing map-based process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Neural Process (QNPy) has shown to be a good tool for modeling quasar light curves. However, given the complex nature of the source and hence the data represented by light curves, processing could be time-consuming. In some cases, accuracy is not good enough for further analysis. In an attempt to upgrade QNPy, we examine the effect of the prepossessing quasar light curves via the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm on modeling a large number of quasar light curves. After applying SOM on SWIFT/BAT data and modeling curves from several clusters, results show the Conditional Neural Process performs better after SOM classification. We conclude that SOM classification of quasar light curves could be a beneficial prepossessing method for QNPy.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Performance of Detectors for Athena's WFI: Measurements and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depleted p-channel field effect transistor is the chosen sensor type for the Wide Field Imager of the Athena mission. It will be used in two types of cameras. One will enable observations of a field of view of 40' x 40' by using an array of four 512 x 512 pixel sensors in a 2 x 2 configuration. A second, small one is designed to investigate bright, point-like sources with a time resolution of up to 40 microseconds. Sensors of final size, layout, and technology were fabricated, assembled and characterised. Also, first results from the flight production are available and confirm the excellent performance. In order to be able to estimate the future performance of degraded detectors, a simulation was developed that takes into account the non-analytical threshold effects on the basis of measurement results. We present the measurement analysis and the comparison of simulated and measured values as well as first attempts to use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict performance results based on noise measurements.</description>

      <title>ESO's new generation of Exposure Time Calculators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users of astronomical observatories rely on Exposure Time Calculators (ETC) to prepare their proposals and then their observations. The ETC is therefore a crucial element in an observatory's data workflow and in particular is key to optimise the use of telescope times. This is also true for the La Silla Paranal Observatory and ESO has therefore embarked in a project to modernise its ETC, based on a python back-end and an Angular-based front-end, while also providing a programmatic interface. This ETC 2.0 has now been implemented for all the new Paranal and La Silla instruments (CRIRES, ERIS, HARPS/NIRPS, and 4MOST) and work is ongoing to implement it for MOONS. All the current ESO La Silla and Paranal instruments will also be migrated progressively, and the first one has been FORS2. The new ETC2 is based on the Instrument Packages, which should allow in the future a smooth interaction with the Phase 1 and Phase 2 observation preparation tools. Moreover, the ETC 2.0 framework has recently been upgraded and makes now use of the NgRx/Store technology in the front-end.</description>

      <title>Progress on FORS-Up: the first instrument using ELT technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ESO is in the process of upgrading one of the two FORS (FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph) instruments - a multi-mode (imaging, polarimetry, long-slit, and multi-object spectroscopy) optical instrument mounted on the Cassegrain focus of Unit Telescope 1 of ESO's Very Large Telescope. FORS1 was moved from Chile to Trieste, and is undergoing complete refurbishment, including the exchange of all motorised parts. In addition, new software is developed, based on the Extremely Large Telescope Instrument Control Software Framework, as the upgraded FORS1 will be the first instrument in operations to use this framework. The new Teledyne e2V CCD has now been procured and is undergoing testing with the New Generation Controller at ESO. In addition, a new set of grisms have been developed, and a new set of filters will be purchased. A new internal calibration unit has been designed, making the operations more efficient.</description>

      <title>Scientific Text Analysis with Robots applied to observatory proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To test the potential disruptive effect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformers (e.g., ChatGPT) and their associated Large Language Models on the time allocation process, both in proposal reviewing and grading, an experiment has been set-up at ESO for the P112 Call for Proposals. The experiment aims at raising awareness in the ESO community and build valuable knowledge by identifying what future steps ESO and other observatories might need to take to stay up to date with current technologies. We present here the results of the experiment, which may further be used to inform decision-makers regarding the use of AI in the proposal review process. We find that the ChatGPT-adjusted proposals tend to receive lower grades compared to the original proposals. Moreover, ChatGPT 3.5 can generally not be trusted in providing correct scientific references, while the most recent version makes a better, but far from perfect, job. We also studied how ChatGPT deals with assessing proposals. It does an apparent remarkable job at providing a summary of ESO proposals, although it doesn't do so good to identify weaknesses. When looking at how it evaluates proposals, however, it appears that ChatGPT systematically gives a higher mark than humans, and tends to prefer proposals written by itself.</description>

      <title>Brightness Characterization for Starlink Direct-to-Cell Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean apparent magnitude of Starlink Mini Direct-To-Cell (DTC) satellites is 4.62 while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km is 5.50. DTCs average 4.9 times brighter than other Starlink Mini spacecraft at a common distance. We cannot currently separate the effects of the DTC antenna itself, the different attitude modes that may be required for DTC operations and to what extent brightness mitigation procedures were in place at the times of our observations. In a best case scenario, where DTC brightness mitigation is as successful as that for other Minis and the DTC antenna does not add significantly to brightness, we estimate that DTCs will be about 2.6 times as bright as the others based upon their lower altitudes. The DTCs spend a greater fraction of their time in the Earth's shadow than satellites at higher altitudes. That will offset some of their impact on astronomical observing.</description>

      <title>Determining Research Priorities Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize our exploratory investigation into whether Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied to publicly available professional text can substantially augment strategic planning for astronomy. We find that an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using content drawn from astronomy journal papers can be used to infer high-priority research areas. While the LDA models are challenging to interpret, we find that they may be strongly associated with meaningful keywords and scientific papers which allow for human interpretation of the topic models.
  Significant correlation is found between the results of applying these models to the previous decade of astronomical research ("1998-2010" corpus) and the contents of the science frontier panel report which contains high-priority research areas identified by the 2010 National Academies' Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey ("DS2010" corpus). Significant correlations also exist between model results of the 1998-2010 corpus and the submitted whitepapers to the Decadal Survey ("whitepapers" corpus). Importantly, we derive predictive metrics based on these results which can provide leading indicators of which content modeled by the topic models will become highly cited in the future. Using these identified metrics and the associations between papers and topic models it is possible to identify important papers for planners to consider.
  A preliminary version of our work was presented by Thronson etal. 2021 and Thomas etal. 2022.</description>

      <title>Wavefront sensing with a Gradient Phase Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront sensors have now become core components in the fields of metrology of optical systems, biomedical optics, and adaptive optics systems for astronomy. However, none of the designs used or proposed so far achieve simultaneously a high spatial resolution at the pupil of the tested optics and absolute measurement accuracy comparable to those of modern laser-interferometers. This paper presents an improved wavefront sensor concept that reaches both previous goals. This device named Crossed-sine phase sensor (CSPS) is based on a fully transparent gradient phase filter (GPF) placed at an intermediate location between the virtual pupil and image planes of the tested optics. The theoretical principle of the sensor is described in Fourier optics formalism. Numerical simulations confirm that a measurement accuracy of Lambda/100 RMS is achievable. The CSPS also offers the advantages of being quasi-achromatic and working on spatially or spectrally extended, natural or artificial light sources</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity -- IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of LISA Pathfinder performance results: time evolution, noise projection, physical models, and implications for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the LISA Pathfinder differential acceleration performance over the entire course of its science operations, spanning approximately 500 days. We find that: 1) the evolution of the Brownian noise that dominates the acceleration amplitude spectral density (ASD), for frequencies $f\gtrsim 1\,\text{mHz}$, is consistent with the decaying pressure due to the outgassing of a single gaseous species. 2) between $f=36\,\mu\text{Hz}$ and $1\,\text{mHz}$, the acceleration ASD shows a $1/f$ tail in excess of the Brownian noise of almost constant amplitude, with $\simeq 20\%$ fluctuations over a period of a few days, with no particular time pattern over the course of the mission; 3) at the lowest considered frequency of $f=18\,\mu\text{Hz}$, the ASD significantly deviates from the $1/f$ behavior, because of temperature fluctuations that appear to modulate a quasi-static pressure gradient, sustained by the asymmetries of the outgassing pattern. We also present the results of a projection of the observed acceleration noise on the potential sources for which we had either a direct correlation measurement, or a quantitative estimate from dedicated experiments. These sources account for approximately $40\%$ of the noise power in the $1/f$ tail. Finally, we analyze the possible sources of the remaining unexplained fraction, and identify the possible measures that may be taken to keep those under control in LISA.</description>

      <title>The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method to search for long transient gravitational waves signals, like those expected from fast spinning newborn magnetars, in interferometric detector data. Standard search techniques are computationally unfeasible (matched filtering) or very demanding (sub-optimal semi-coherent methods). We explored a different approach by means of machine learning paradigms, to define a fast and inexpensive procedure. We used convolutional neural networks to develop a classifier that is able to discriminate between the presence or the absence of a signal. To complement the classification and enhance its effectiveness, we also developed a denoiser. We studied the performance of both networks with simulated colored noise, according to the design noise curve of LIGO interferometers. We show that the combination of the two models is crucial to increase the chance of detection. Indeed, as we decreased the signal initial amplitude (from $10^{-22}$ down to $10^{-23}$) the classification task became more difficult. In particular, we could not correctly tag signals with an initial amplitude of $2 \times 10^{-23}$ without using the denoiser. By studying the performance of the combined networks, we found a good compromise between the search false alarm rate (2$\%$) and efficiency (90$\%$) for a single interferometer. In addition, we demonstrated that our method is robust with respect to changes in the power law describing the time evolution of the signal frequency. Our results highlight the computationally low cost of this method to generate triggers for long transient signals. The study carried out in this work lays the foundations for further improvements, with the purpose of developing a pipeline able to perform systematic searches of long transient signals.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>

Abstract: We explore interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing, focusing on axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. Positioning an optical transmitter in the lens's focal region, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited annular beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We analyze the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the projected beam's structure, estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, and assess the major noise sources. We determine detection sensitivity in both noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the transmitting lens's PSF. Our findings indicate that detecting lensed optical signals from nearby stars is achievable using established optical engineering technologies. A network of spatially distributed astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will enhance the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: JWST/NIRCam observations of the young giant planet $\beta$ Pic b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first JWST/NIRCam observations of the directly-imaged gas giant exoplanet $\beta$ Pic b. Observations in six filters using NIRCam's round coronagraphic masks provide a high signal-to-noise detection of $\beta$ Pic b and the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic over a wavelength range of $\sim$1.7-5 $\mu$m. This paper focuses on the detection of $\beta$ Pic b and other potential point sources in the NIRCam data, following a paper by Rebollido et al. which presented the NIRCam and MIRI view of the debris disk around $\beta$ Pic. We develop and validate approaches for obtaining accurate photometry of planets in the presence of bright, complex circumstellar backgrounds. By simultaneously fitting the planet's PSF and a geometric model for the disk, we obtain planet photometry that is in good agreement with previous measurements from the ground. The NIRCam data supports the cloudy nature of $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere and the discrepancy between its mass as inferred from evolutionary models and the dynamical mass reported in the literature. We further identify five additional localized sources in the data, but all of them are found to be background stars or galaxies based on their color or spatial extent. We can rule out additional planets in the disk midplane above 1 Jupiter mass outward of 2 arcsec ($\sim$40 au) and away from the disk midplane above 0.05 Jupiter masses outward of 4 arcsec ($\sim$80 au). The inner giant planet $\beta$ Pic c remains undetected behind the coronagraphic masks of NIRCam in our observations.</description>
