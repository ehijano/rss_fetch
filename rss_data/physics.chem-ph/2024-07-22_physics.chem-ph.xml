      <title>Non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements in a magnetic field: geometric gauge dependence and Berry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are important in quantum chemistry, particularly for molecular dynamics methods such as surface hopping. However, NACMEs are gauge dependent. This presents a difficulty for their calculation in general, where there are no restrictions on the gauge function except that it be differentiable. These cases are relevant for complex-valued electronic wave functions, such as those that arise in the presence of a magnetic field or spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, the Berry curvature and Berry force play an important role in molecular dynamics in a magnetic field, and are also relevant in the context of spin-orbit coupling. For methods such as surface hopping, excited-state Berry curvatures will also be of interest. With this in mind, we have developed a scheme for the calculation of continuous, differentiable NACMEs as a function of the molecular geometry for complex-valued wave functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by using the H$_2$ molecule at the full configuration-interaction (FCI) level of theory. Additionally, ground- and excited- state Berry curvatures are computed for the first time using FCI theory. Finally, Berry phases are computed directly in terms of diagonal NACMEs.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Born Oppenheimer Approximation for Molecules and Materials via Electric Field Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab initio method for computing vibro-polariton and phonon-polariton spectra of molecules and solids coupled to the photon modes of optical cavities. We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes with both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), spectra can be expressed in terms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements which are readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) implementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters can be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure calculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in terms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response properties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges which enter into the vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response properties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain $\Gamma$ point phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for a selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to demonstrate the method.</description>

      <title>Potential Distribution Theory of Alchemical Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation to the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor, for which analytical descriptions are available with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the TEMOA host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.</description>

      <title>${\it Asparagus}$: A Toolkit for Autonomous, User-Guided Construction of Machine-Learned Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the establishment of machine learning (ML) techniques in the scientific community, the construction of ML potential energy surfaces (ML-PES) has become a standard process in physics and chemistry. So far, improvements in the construction of ML-PES models have been conducted independently, creating an initial hurdle for new users to overcome and complicating the reproducibility of results. Aiming to reduce the bar for the extensive use of ML-PES, we introduce ${\it Asparagus}$, a software package encompassing the different parts into one coherent implementation that allows an autonomous, user-guided construction of ML-PES models. ${\it Asparagus}$ combines capabilities of initial data sampling with interfaces to ${\it ab
  initio}$ calculation programs, ML model training, as well as model evaluation and its application within other codes such as ASE or CHARMM. The functionalities of the code are illustrated in different examples, including the dynamics of small molecules, the representation of reactive potentials in organometallic compounds, and atom diffusion on periodic surface structures. The modular framework of ${\it Asparagus}$ is designed to allow simple implementations of further ML-related methods and models to provide constant user-friendly access to state-of-the-art ML techniques.</description>

      <title>Quasi-classical Trajectory Calculations on a Two-state Potential Energy Surface Including Nonadiabatic Coupling Terms as Friction for D+ + H2 Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Akin to the traditional quasi-classical trajectory method for investigating the dynamics on a single adiabatic potential energy surface for an elementary chemical reaction, we carry out the dynamics on a 2-state ab initio potential energy surface including nonadiabatic coupling terms as friction terms for D+ + H2 collisions. It is shown that the resulting dynamics correctly accounts for nonreactive charge transfer, reactive non charge transfer and reactive charge transfer processes. In addition, it leads to the formation of triatomic DH2+ species as well.</description>

      <title>Text-Augmented Multimodal LLMs for Chemical Reaction Condition Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput reaction condition (RC) screening is fundamental to chemical synthesis. However, current RC screening suffers from laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows. Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools fail to find suitable RCs due to data sparsity and inadequate reaction representations. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design, and chemical logic Q\&amp;A tasks. However, LLMs have not yet achieved accurate predictions of chemical reaction conditions. Here, we present MM-RCR, a text-augmented multimodal LLM that learns a unified reaction representation from SMILES, reaction graphs, and textual corpus for chemical reaction recommendation (RCR). To train MM-RCR, we construct 1.2 million pair-wised Q\&amp;A instruction datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that MM-RCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two open benchmark datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets. MM-RCR has the potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Muffin Tin Orbitals (EWMTO) within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a new efficient basis for the electronic structure problem. The basis is based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to problem of finding the ground state electron density is most often done through an iterative process, where generically on the order of over 20 iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional for the fixed form of the external potential. We use eigenstate information from the previous convergence iteration to choose the energies of the eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter as they are cancelled out. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Involvement of the environment is indispensable for establishing the statistical distribution of system. We analyze the statistical distribution of a quantum system coupled strongly with a heat bath. This distribution is determined by tracing over the bath's degrees of freedom for the equilibrium system-plus-bath composite. The stability of system distribution is largely affected by the system--bath interaction strength. We propose that the quantum system exhibits a stable distribution only when its system response function in the frequency domain satisfies $\tilde\chi(\omega = 0+)&gt;0$. We show our results by investigating the non-interacting bosonic impurity system from both the thermodynamic and dynamic perspectives. Our study refines the theoretical framework of canonical statistics, offering insights into thermodynamic phenomena in small-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Viologen-based supramolecular crystal gels: gelation kinetics and sensitivity to temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supramolecular crystal gels, a subset of molecular gels, form through self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators into interconnecting crystalline fibers, creating a three-dimensional soft solid network. This study focuses on the formation and properties of viologen-based supramolecular crystalline gels. It aims to answer key questions about the tunability of network properties and the origin of these properties through in-depth analyses of the gelation kinetics triggered by thermal quenching. Experimental investigations, including UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, rheology, microscopy and scattering measurements, contribute to a comprehensive and self-consistent understanding of the system kinetics. We confirm that the viologen-based gelators crystallize into nanometer radius hollow tubes that assemble into micro to millimetric spherulites. We then show that the crystallization follows the Avrami theory and is based on pre-existing nuclei. We also establish that the growth is interface controlled leading to the hollow tubes to branch into spherulites with fractal structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the gel properties can be tuned depending on the quenching temperature. Lowering the temperature results in the formation of denser and smaller spherulites. In contrast, the gels elasticity is not significantly affected by the quench temperature, leading us to hypothesize that the spherulites densification occurs at the expense of the connectivity between spherulite.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly spectral unmixing based on Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an on-the-fly (i.e., online) linear unmixing method which is able to sequentially analyze spectral data acquired on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis. After deriving a sequential counterpart of the conventional linear mixing model, the proposed approach recasts the linear unmixing problem into a linear state-space estimation framework. Under Gaussian noise and state models, the estimation of the pure spectra can be efficiently conducted by resorting to Kalman filtering. Interestingly, it is shown that this Kalman filter can operate in a lower-dimensional subspace while ensuring the nonnegativity constraint inherent to pure spectra. This dimensionality reduction allows significantly lightening the computational burden, while leveraging recent advances related to the representation of essential spectral information. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real Raman data sets. The results show that this Kalman filter-based method offers a convenient trade-off between unmixing accuracy and computational efficiency, which is crucial for operating in an on-the-fly setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first operational method which is able to solve the spectral unmixing problem efficiently in a dynamic fashion. It also constitutes a valuable building block for benefiting from acquisition and processing frameworks recently proposed in the microscopy literature, which are motivated by practical issues such as reducing acquisition time and avoiding potential damages being inflicted to photosensitive samples.</description>

      <title>The orientation dependence of cavity-modified chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have explored how ultra-strong light--matter coupling can be used as a handle to control chemical transformations. {\em Ab initio} cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations demonstrate that large changes to reaction energies or barrier heights can be realized by coupling electronic degrees of freedom to vacuum fluctuations associated with an optical cavity mode, provided that large enough coupling strengths can be achieved. In many cases, the cavity effects display a pronounced orientational dependence. In this Perspective, we highlight the critical role that geometry relaxation can play in such studies. As an example, we consider recent work [Nat.~Commun.~{\bf 14}, 2766 (2023)] that explored the influence of an optical cavity on Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions and reported large changes to reaction enthalpies and barrier heights, as well as the observation that changes in orientation can inhibit the reaction or select for one reaction product or another. Those calculations used fixed molecular geometries optimized in the absence of the cavity and fixed relative orientations of the molecules and the cavity mode polarization axis. Here, we show that, when given a chance to relax in the presence of the cavity, the molecular species reorient in a way that eliminates the orientational dependence. Moreover, in this case, we find that qualitatively different conclusions regarding the impact of the cavity on the thermodynamics of the reaction can be drawn from calculations that consider relaxed versus unrelaxed molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>

Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>

      <title>Isotope-shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>

Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$, $3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ and $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Electron localization function for non-collinear spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding of bonding is key to modelling materials and predicting properties thereof. A widely adopted indicator of bonds and atomic shells is the electron localization function (ELF). The building blocks of the ELF are also used in the construction of modern density functional approximations. Here we demonstrate that the ELF breaks down when applied beyond regular non-relativistic quantum states. We show that for tackling general non-collinear open-shell solutions, it is essential to address both the U(1) gauge invariance -- i.e., invariance under a multiplication by a position dependent phase factor -- and SU(2) gauge invariance -- i.e. invariance under local spin rotations -- {\em conjointly}. Remarkably, we find that the extended ELF also improves the description of paradigmatic collinear states.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Resolution Imaging of Ice Crystallized from Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>
