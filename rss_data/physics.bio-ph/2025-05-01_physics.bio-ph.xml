      <title>Analytical model and experimental validation for nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a physics-based analytical model to describe the nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells. By representing the elastic energy through a stretching modulus, $K$, and a dimensionless ratio, $\delta$, capturing the balance between stretching and bending energies, the model reveals mechanical behaviors extending beyond conventional approaches. Validated across microscale droplets and macroscale silicone sheets by fitting experimental force-displacement curves, this approach provides accurate, scalable characterization of deformed elastic shells. This framework advances our understanding of soft thin-shell mechanics, with broad applications in probing living cells and designing soft materials.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of In Vivo Subject-Specific Mechanical Modeling of the Optic Nerve Head for Robust Assessment of Ocular Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To establish the tissue regions necessary to accurately represent the mechanics of the optic nerve head (ONH), imaging data of the ONH from 2 healthy subjects were used to create in vivo subject-specific eye mechanical models considering distinct properties for all major ocular tissues. Tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the material properties and the inclusion of these tissues on the mechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC), retina, and optic nerve. Then, the LC mechanical response due to variations in intraocular and intracranial pressures was evaluated to validate the modeling approach. The sclera stiffness has the largest impact on the mechanics of the LC, retina, and optic nerve, while Bruchs membrane has a negligible effect on these tissues response. The validation tests showed increased LC strain with increased pressure and highest strains in the inferior and temporal subregion, as seen in literature studies. Consequently, accurate ONH mechanical representation can be obtained by only including those tissue regions identified as necessary.</description>

      <title>Topology, Kinetics and Inheritance in Clonal Colonies of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent skeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to produce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may severely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore, reaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on the factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy, we study the structure of N=28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony derived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh generation. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the replicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics are strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors linking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a lineage's topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible for the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an entropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random clustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find a clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of inactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Langevin Equation with Uncertainty via Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.</description>

      <title>Temporal network restructuring improves control of indecisive collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling multi-agent systems is a persistent challenge in organismal, robotic and social collectives, especially when agents exhibit stochastic indecisiveness -- frequently switching between conflicting behavioral rules. Here, we investigate the control of such noisy indecisive collectives through the lens of century-old sheepdog trials, where small groups of sheep exhibit unpredictable switching between fleeing and following behaviors. Unlike cohesive large flocks, these small indecisive groups are difficult to control, yet skilled dog-handler teams excel at both herding and precisely splitting them (shedding) on demand. Using a stochastic model, we introduce two central parameters -- pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) -- to simulate and quantify herding and shedding dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that stochastic indecisiveness, typically perceived as a challenge, can be leveraged as a critical tool for efficient control, enabling controlled herding and splitting of noisy groups. Building on these insights, we develop the Indecisive Swarm Algorithm (ISA) for artificial agents and benchmark its performance against standard algorithms, including the Averaging-Based Swarm Algorithm (ASA) and the Leader-Follower Swarm Algorithm (LFSA). ISA minimizes control energy in trajectory-following tasks, outperforming alternatives under noisy conditions. By framing these results within a stochastic temporal network framework, we show that even with a probabilistic description of the future dynamics, network restructuring (temporality) enhances control efficiency in a specific class of control problems. These insights establish a scalable framework for controlling noisy, behavior-switching collectives, with applications in swarm robotics, cellular engineering, opinion dynamics, and temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of planar vector fields with a limit cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a cornerstone of computational biology. While mechanistic models might describe the interactions of interest of a system, they are often difficult to study. On the other hand, abstract models might capture key features but remain disconnected from experimental manipulation. Geometric methods have been useful in connecting both approaches, although they have only been established for specific type of systems. Phenomena of biological relevance, such as limit cycles, are still difficult to study using conventional methods. In this paper, I explore an alternative description of planar dynamical systems and I present an algorithm to compute numerically the geometric structure of planar systems with a limit cycle.</description>

      <title>Active Transport of Cargo-Carrying and Interconnected Chiral Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. Our results further show that in the dilute limit, this desired accumulation behavior persists despite the presence of excluded volume effects. Additionally, interconnected chiral active particles exhibit emergent chemotaxis beyond a critical chain length, with trimers and longer chains exhibiting strong accumulation at sufficiently high chiral torques. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity red than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>
