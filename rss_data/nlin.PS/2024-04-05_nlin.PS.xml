      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary theory of convective organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed patterns of convective cloud would be extremely improbable from random walks in an abstract space of configurations. Forcing is sometimes the driver, but complexity can also develop spontaneously. Here pattern evolution is considered as a natural selection process in a strategic game among configurations, akin to ecological succession. Information (entropy) quantifies improbability, interpreted as Darwinian fitness to the extent larger-scale forcings are properly accounted. Reconciling inferred or revealed fitness with energetics could make convection a showcase of evolutionary theory, simply as reinterpretation of spectral kinetic energy (KE) budgets for dry convection. For moist convection, the flux of a total energy E, the teleological reason for convection, is conjectured to be the central resource of an evolutionary game, with water playing a constraining role like nutrients in ecology. Shannon information H is reviewed in context of this evolutionary reasoning. Analysis of a new Cloud Botany shallow convection simulation set shows growth of H over tens of hours (perhaps more pertinently, it grows with KE throughput or cumulative buoyancy flux). Anisotropy and precipitation boost H in qualitatively distinct and contingent ways, like separate species or ecological guilds. Deep convection over lowland South America also shows many-hour evolution times, beyond simple convective adjustment notions. If evolving horizontal patterns contain or imply information about vertical density profiles, they could become a new resource in data assimilation to predict larger scale flow.</description>

      <title>Enhanced mobility of quantum droplets in periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict that one- and two-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets, forming in Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum corrections to the mean-field energy, may demonstrate exceptional mobility in periodic optical lattices and that they may exhibit considerable displacements across the lattice, remaining dynamically stable, even under weak initial phase kicks imparted to them. Mobility properties of quantum droplets are determined by their internal structure and strongly depend on the number of particles in them. We find that due to the peculiar effect of the LHY quantum corrections, odd (i.e., on-site centered) and even (i.e., intersite-centered) one-dimensional quantum droplets feature alternating mobility and immobility bands closely corresponding to the regions, where translational perturbation mode is unstable and stable, respectively. This picture becomes even richer in two-dimensional case, where odd-odd, even-odd or even-even quantum droplets also feature alternating mobility and immobility domains, and where, surprisingly, the droplet may be mobile in one direction, but immobile in the orthogonal direction. We link changes in mobility properties with multiple intersections of energy $E(\mu)$ and norm $N(\mu)$ dependencies for droplets with different internal structure.</description>
