      <title>Bounded asymptotics for high-order moments in wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent wall-flows are the most important means for understanding the effects of boundary conditions and fluid viscosity on turbulent fluctuations. There has been considerable recent research on mean-square fluctuations. Here, we present expressions for high-order moments of streamwise velocity fluctuation $u$, in the form $ \langle u^{+2q} \rangle^{1/q}=\alpha_q-\beta_q y^{\ast1/4}$; $q$ is an integer, $\alpha_q$ and $\beta_q$ are constants independent of the friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau$, and $y^{\ast} = y/\delta$ is the distance away from the wall, normalized by the flow thickness $\delta$; in particular, $\alpha_q =\mu+\sigma q$ according to the `linear q-norm Gaussian' process, where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are flow-independent constants. Excellent agreement is found between these formulae and available data in pipes, channels and boundary layers for $1 \leq q \leq 5$. For fixed $y^+ = y^*Re_\tau$, the present {formulation} leads to the bounded state $\langle u^{+2q} \rangle^{1/q}=\alpha_q$ as $Re_\tau\rightarrow\infty$ while the attached eddy model predicts that {the} moments continually grow as log Reynolds number.</description>

      <title>Onset of spontaneous beating and whirling in the follower force model of an active filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the onset of spontaneous dynamics in the follower force model of an active filament, wherein a slender elastic filament in a viscous liquid is clamped normal to a wall at one end and subjected to a tangential compressive force at the other. Clarke, Hwang and Keaveny (Phys. Rev. Fluids, to appear) have recently conducted a thorough investigation of this model using methods of computational dynamical systems; inter alia, they show that the filament first losses stability via a supercritical double-Hopf bifurcation, with periodic 'planar-beating' states (unstable) and 'whirling' states (stable) simultaneously emerging at the critical follower-force value. We complement their numerical study by carrying out a weakly nonlinear analysis close to this unconventional bifurcation, using the method of multiple scales. The main outcome is an 'amplitude equation' governing the slow modulation of small-magnitude oscillations of the filament in that regime. Analysis of this reduced-order model provides insights into the onset of spontaneous dynamics, including the creation of the nonlinear whirling states from particular superpositions of linear planar-beating modes as well as the selection of whirling over planar beating in three-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-modal growth analysis of high-speed flows over an inclined cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial optimal responses to both inlet disturbances and harmonic external forcing for hypersonic flows over a blunt cone at nonzero angles of attack are obtained by efficiently solving the direct-adjoint equations with a parabolic approach. In either case, the most amplified disturbances initially take the form of localized streamwise vortices on the windward side and will undergo a two-stage evolution process when propagating downstream: they first experience a substantial algebraic growth by exploiting the Orr and lift-up mechanisms, and then smoothly transition to a quasi exponential-growth stage driven by the crossflow-instability mechanism, accompanied by an azimuthal advection of the disturbance structure towards the leeward side. The algebraic-growth phase is most receptive to the external forcing, whereas the exponential-growth stage relies on the disturbance frequency and can be significantly strengthened by increasing the angle of attack. The wavemaker delineating the structural sensitivity region for the optimal gain is shown to lie on the windward side immediately downstream of the inlet, implying a potent control strategy. Additionally, considerable non-modal growth is also observed for broadband high-frequency disturbances residing in the entropy layer.</description>

      <title>CFD analysis on the performance of a coaxial rotor with lift offset at high advance ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aerodynamic performance of an isolated coaxial rotor in forward flight is analyzed by a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The analysis focuses on the high-speed forward flight with an advance ratio of 0.5 or higher. The effect of the degree of the rolling moment on the rotor thrust, called lift offset, is studied in detail. The coaxial rotor model is a pair of contrarotating rotors, each rotor consisting of two untwisted blades with a radius of 1.016 m. The pitch angle of the blades is controlled by both collective and cyclic as in a conventional single main-rotor helicopter. CFD analysis is performed using a flow solver based on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a Reynolds-averaged turbulence model. Laminar/turbulent transition in the boundary layer is taken into account in the calculation. The rotor trim for target forces and moments is achieved using a gradient-based delta-form blade pitch angle adjusting technique in conjunction with CFD analysis. The reliability of the calculations is confirmed by comparison with published wind tunnel experiments and two comprehensive analyses. Applying the lift offset improves the lift-to-effective drag ratio (lift-drag ratio) and reduces thrust fluctuations. However, in the case where the advance ratio exceeds 0.6, the lift-drag ratio drops significantly even if the lift offset is 0.3. The thrust fluctuation also increases with such a high advance ratio. Detailed analysis reveals that the degradation of aerodynamic performance and vibratory aerodynamic loads is closely related to the pitch angle control to compensate for the reduction in thrust on the retreating side due to the increased reverse flow region. It is effective to reduce the collective and longitudinal cyclic pitch angles for the improvement of the aerodynamic performance of coaxial rotors with an appropriate lift offset.</description>

      <title>Resonance and Damping in Drop-Cantilever Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the dynamics of a droplet impacting and oscillating a polycarbonate cantilever beam of nine varying lengths. We analyzed the cantilever's damping and vibration frequency in relation to a resonance length, where the frequencies of the droplet and the cantilever are equal. In the pre-resonance length, the beam vibrates at a frequency higher than that of the droplet. Upon reaching resonance, the frequencies of both the droplet and the cantilever align, and the cantilever is out of phase with the oscillation of the droplet's apex. This leads to increased damping rates. At this resonance length, the droplet's force and the direction of the cantilever oppose each other. When the cantilever length exceeds the resonance length, it synchronize more with the droplet apex. This alignment allows the droplet force and the cantilever to work in phase. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the damping effect of droplet impacts on elastic surfaces around resonance.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability and feedthrough in a resistive liquid-metal liner of a finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of magnetic tension and diffusion on the perturbation growth of a liquid-metal liner subjected to the magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability is investigated. An initially magnetic-field-free liquid-metal slab of finite thickness is surrounded by two lower-density regions. Within the lower region, a constant axial magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude is applied. The numerical examination of the MRT instability growth, initiated by a seeded perturbation parallel to the magnetic field at the liner's unstable interface, is performed for both perfectly conductive and resistive liners. To this end, a novel level set-based two-phase incompressible solver for ideal/resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows within the finite-difference framework is introduced. Utilizing the implemented numerical toolkit, the impact of different Alfven numbers and magnetic Reynolds numbers on the MRT growth rate and feedthrough at the upper interface of the liner is studied. Accounting for the finite resistivity of the liner results in an increase in the MRT growth and feedthrough compared to the ideal MHD case. The results indicate that magnetic diffusion primarily affects the MRT growth rate for higher wavenumbers, while for smaller wavenumbers, the effect of finite resistivity is only observed over a longer duration of instability development. We further demonstrate that decreasing the Alfven number results in the faster emergence of the magnetic diffusion effect on the MRT growth rate. It is also observed that a greater electrical conductivity jump across the liner results in an increased perturbation growth. Lastly, the impact of surface tension on MRT instability growth for both ideal and resistive MHD cases is studied across different wavenumbers, specifically for Bond numbers related to fusion applications.</description>

      <title>Viscous Instabilities in Transversely Strained Channel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate here linear stability in a canonical three-dimensional boundary layer generated by the superposition of a spanwise pressure gradient upon an otherwise standard channel flow. As the main result, we introduce a simple coordinate transformation that enables the complete description of modal and non-modal stability using previous results on Poiseuille flow. We leverage this insight to derive closed forms for some relevant stability metrics. In particular, the critical Reynolds number for exponential-in-time growth is found to monotonically decrease with the strength of the cross-flow. A suitably chosen re-scaling, however, shows that the stability characteristics ultimately approach those of channel flow, despite the presence of a non-zero spanwise shear. Unstable eigenmodes akin to the Tollmien-Schlichting wave are found to propagate along the direction of the net flow. From a non-modal perspective, the maximal transient (algebraic) growth increases quadratically with the spanwise pressure differential and, similar to two-dimensional flows, is fueled by the lift-up effect. In this regard, the linear energy budget highlights a dramatic increase in energy production against the spanwise shear.</description>

      <title>Enhancing interfacial thermal transport by nanostructures: Monte Carlo simulations with ab initio phonon properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have indicated that employing nanostructures can enhance interfacial heat transport, but the mechanism by which different structural morphologies and dimensions contribute to the full-spectrum phonon interfacial transport remains unclear. In this paper, a multiscale method to study the thermal transfer at nanostructured interfaces is developed by combining density functional calculation, Monte Carlo simulation, and diffuse mismatch method. The changes in the transport paths and contributions to thermal conductance of different frequency phonons caused by changes in nanostructure morphology and size are investigated. The results show that, compared to the triangular and trapezoidal nanostructures, the rectangular nanostructures are more beneficial in enhancing the probability of the reflected phonons encountering the interface, and thus the phonon interfacial transmittance. The nanostructure makes the interfacial heat flow extremely heterogeneous, with significant transverse heat flow occurring at the sidewalls, resulting in a new thermal conduction pathway. The phenomena of multiple reflections and double transmission together lead to the existence of the optimal dimension that maximizes the nanostructures enhancement effect on interfacial heat transfer. The optimal nanostructure width is 100 nm when the height is 100 nm and the maximum interfacial thermal conductance enhancement ratio is 1.31. These results can guide the design of heat transfer enhancement structures at the interface of the actual high-power chips.</description>

      <title>Influences of stoichiometry on steadily propagating triple flames in counterflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies of triple flames in counterflowing streams of fuel and oxidizer have been focused on the symmetric problem in which the stoichiometric mixture fraction is $1/2$. There then exist lean and rich premixed flames of roughly equal strengths, with a diffusion flame trailing behind from the stoichiometric point at which they meet. In the majority of realistic situations, however, the stoichiometric mixture fraction departs appreciably from unity, typically being quite small. With the objective of clarifying the influences of stoichiometry, attention is focused on one of the simplest possible models, addressed here mainly by numerical integration. When the stoichiometric mixture fraction departs appreciably from $1/2$, one of the premixed wings is found to be dominant to such an extent that the diffusion flame and the other premixed flame are very weak by comparison. These curved, partially premixed flames are expected to be relevant in realistic configurations. In addition, a simple kinematic balance is shown to predict the shape of the front and the propagation velocity reasonably well in the limit of low stretch and low curvature.</description>

      <title>Diffusive-thermal instabilities of a planar premixed flame aligned with a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of a thick planar premixed flame, propagating steadily in a direction transverse to that of unidirectional shear flow, is studied. A linear stability analysis is carried out in the asymptotic limit of infinitely large activation energy, yielding a dispersion relation. The relation characterises the coupling between Taylor dispersion (or shear-enhanced diffusion) and the flame thermo-diffusive instabilities, in terms of two main parameters, namely, the reactant Lewis number $Le$ and the flow Peclet number $Pe$. The implications of the dispersion relation are discussed and various flame instabilities are identified and classified in the $Le$-$Pe$ plane. An important original finding is the demonstration that for values of the Peclet number exceeding a critical value, the classical cellular instability, commonly found for $Le&lt;1$, exists now for $Le&gt;1$ but is absent when $Le&lt;1$. In fact, the cellular instability identified for $Le&gt;1$ is shown to occur either through a finite-wavelength stationary bifurcation (also known as type-I$_s$) or through a longwave stationary bifurcation (also known as type-II$_s$). The latter type-II$_s$ bifurcation leads in the weakly nonlinear regime to a Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, which is determined. As for the oscillatory instability, usually encountered in the absence of Taylor dispersion in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures, it is found to be absent if the Peclet number is large enough. The stability findings, which follow from the dispersion relation derived analytically, are complemented and examined numerically for a finite value of the Zeldovich number. The numerical study involves both computations of the eigenvalues of a linear stability boundary-value problem and numerical simulations of the time-dependent governing partial differential equations. The computations are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>On the two-reactant one-step activation-energy asymptotics for steady, adiabatic, planar flames with Lewis numbers of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspects of predictions of activation-energy asymptotics concerning the dependence of the burning velocity on the equivalence ratio are examined here through both asymptotic analyses and numerical computation. In typical hydrocarbon-air flames, the burning velocity achieves its maximum value for fuel-rich mixture, the cause being generally attributed to the effects of detailed chemical kinetics and unequal diffusivities of the reactants. The present results demonstrate the possibility of this attribute of the burning velocity occurring even when these two effects are absent. This is accomplished by parametrically studying the burning-velocity formula valid for all equivalence ratios under the conditions specified in the title of this article, with special attention paid to implications for hydrocarbon-air flames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the harmful contaminants in the atmosphere, which negatively affects the well-being of both humans and animals, is the suspended respirable particles. The most difficult aspect of the study is now removing these fine respirable particles from the atmosphere. This study investigates the scavenging phenomenon of fine hydrophobic liquid aerosols (10 nm to 1050 nm) by uncharged and charged droplets in a self-made scaled test rig. In this study, a hollow cone nozzle with a 1 mm orifice diameter uses tap water to disperse liquid into fine droplets. The paraffin oil and Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacat (DEHS) solution are aerosolized to be scavenged by water droplets. This research employs a high-speed imaging technique and theoretical modeling approach to measure the size distribution and charge acquired by water droplets respectively. The findings of this study show that uncharged droplets dispersed</description>

      <title>Crude Oil Displacement Enhanced by Interfacially Active Nanoparticles and Their Coupling Effect with Low-Salinity Brines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the microscopic scale to the petroleum-reservoir scale, the interfacial phenomena of the crude oil-water-rock system crucially control an immiscible flow in a porous reservoir. One of the key mechanisms is crude oil droplet displacement dynamics, which can be optimized by manipulating the oil-water interfacial tension and the three-phase contact angle by means of chemical injection. The current study primarily investigated oil displacement enhanced by interfacially active nanoparticles, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or pNIPAM, which found an acceleration of oil droplet receding rate (5.66 degree/s) and a greater degree of oil droplet dewetted (37.0 degree contact angle). This was due to a contribution from the nanoparticle-induced structural disjoining pressures between the oil-water and water-solid interfaces. The coupling effect of pNIPAM nanoparticles with low-salinity brines was examined, which revealed a discrepancy in different brine valences. Coupling with divalent CaCl2 led to much slower oil droplet receding dynamics (2.58 degree/s, and 58.7 degree contact angle) since oil-substrate bridging is formulated and promoted by the divalent cation. However, positive synergy was observed with a monovalent NaCl blend. The crude oil dewetting dynamics were enhanced (9.55 degree/s) owing to the combined salt-induced hydration and nanoparticle-induced structural forces. The contact angle was as low as 21.5 degree before eventually detaching from the substrate for a relatively short period (156 s). These findings highlight the coupling effect of nanoparticles and low-salinity brine on the dewetting of heavy crude oil. Adding nanoparticles to an optimal brine could be an option for faster and greater fluid displacement, which is not limited to oil production applications but several others, such as detergency and other forms of geological storage.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multiphase Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Model Driven Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid fluid simulation approach that integrates generative diffusion models with physics-based simulations, aiming at reducing the computational costs of flow simulations while still honoring all the physical properties of interest. These simulations enhance our understanding of applications such as assessing hydrogen and CO$_2$ storage efficiency in underground reservoirs. Nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and the presence of nonunique solutions can require multiple simulations within a single geometry. To overcome the computational cost hurdle, we propose a hybrid method that couples generative diffusion models and physics-based modeling. We introduce a system to condition the diffusion model with a geometry of interest, allowing to produce variable fluid saturations in the same geometry. While training the model, we simultaneously generate initial conditions and perform physics-based simulations using these conditions. This integrated approach enables us to receive real-time feedback on a single compute node equipped with both CPUs and GPUs. By efficiently managing these processes within one compute node, we can continuously evaluate performance and stop training when the desired criteria are met. To test our model, we generate realizations in a real Berea sandstone fracture which shows that our technique is up to 4.4 times faster than commonly used flow simulation initializations.</description>

      <title>Porous plates at incidence</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of permeability on two-dimensional rectangular plates at incidences. The flow topology is investigated for Reynolds number ($Re$) values between 30 and 90, and the forces on the plate are discussed for $Re=30$, where the wake is found to be steady for any value of the Darcy number ($Da$) and the flow incidence ($\alpha$). At $Re=30$, for a plate normal to the stream and vanishing $Da$, the wake shows a vortex dipole with a stagnation point on the plate surface. With increasing $Da$, the separation between the vortex dipole and the plate increases; the vortex dipole shortens and is eventually annihilated at a critical $Da$. For any value of $Da$ below the critical one, the vortex dipole disappears with decreasing $\alpha$. However, at low $Da$, the two saddle-node pairs merge at the same $\alpha$, annihilating the dipole; while at high $Da$, they merge at different $\alpha$, resulting in a single recirculating region for intermediate incidences. The magnitudes of lift, drag, and torque decrease with $Da$. Nevertheless, there exists a range of $Da$ and $\alpha$, where the magnitude of the plate-wise force component increases with $Da$, driven by the shear on the plate's pressure side. Finally, the analysis of the fluid impulse suggests that the lift and drag reduction with $Da$ are associated with the weakening of the leading and trailing edge shear layer, respectively. The present findings will be directly beneficial in understanding the role of permeability on small porous wings.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>

Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in Hydrodynamics from Micro- to Macroscale: Wisdom from Boltzmann and Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that macroscopic irreversible thermodynamics for viscous fluids can be derived from exact information-theoretic thermodynamic identities valid at the microscale. Entropy production, in particular, is a measure of the loss of many-particle correlations in the same way in which it measures the loss of system-reservoirs correlations in stochastic thermodynamics (ST). More specifically, we first show that boundary conditions at the macroscopic level define a natural decomposition of the entropy production rate (EPR) in terms of thermodynamic forces multiplying their conjugate currents, as well as a change in suitable nonequilibrium potential that acts as a Lyapunov function in the absence of forces. Moving to the microscale, we identify the exact identities at the origin of these dissipative contributions for isolated Hamiltonian systems. We then show that the molecular chaos hypothesis, which gives rise to the Boltzmann equation at the mesoscale, leads to a positive rate of loss of many-particle correlations, which we identify with the Boltzmann EPR. By generalizing the Boltzmann equation to account for boundaries with nonuniform temperature and nonzero velocity, and resorting to the Chapman-Enskog expansion, we recover the macroscopic theory we started from. Finally, using a linearized Boltzmann equation we derive ST for dilute particles in a weakly out-of-equilibrium fluid and its corresponding macroscopic thermodynamics. Our work unambiguously demonstrates the information-theoretical origin of thermodynamic notions of entropy and dissipation in macroscale irreversible thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres across the jamming and viscous-to-inertial transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres is studied across jamming but also across the viscous and inertial regimes using a custom pressure- and volume-imposed rheometer. The study shows that the granular rheology found for suspensions of hard spheres can be extended to a soft granular rheology (SGranR) by renormalizing the critical volume fraction and friction coefficient to pressure-dependent values and using the addition of the viscous and inertial stress scales. This SGranR encompasses rheological behaviors on both sides of the jamming transition, resulting in an approximate collapse of the rheological data into two branches when scaled with the distance to jamming, as observed for soft colloids. This research suggests that suspensions of soft particles across flow regimes can be described by a unified SGranR framework around the jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusion of the Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>
