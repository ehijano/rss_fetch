      <title>Ultra-Wideband Tapered Transducers in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate on Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic devices offer significant advantages in size and loss, making them ubiquitous for mobile radio frequency signal processing. However, the usable bandwidth is often limited to the achievable electromechanical coupling, setting a hard limit using typical transducer designs. In this work, we present an ultra-wideband transducer design utilizing a tapered electrode configuration to overcome this limitation. The design is realized on a lithium niobate (LN) on silicon carbide platform, utilizing a combination of first and higher order shear-horizontal modes to generate the ultra-wideband response. The implementation shows a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 55% at 2.23 GHz with an associated insertion loss (IL) of 26 dB for the measured 50 ohm case. Upon improved impedance matching, this performance could be improved to 79% FBW and an IL of 16.5 dB. Upon further development, this ultra-wideband design could be reasonably scaled towards improved FBW and IL trade off to enable improved usability for cases where bandwidth should be prioritized.</description>

      <title>2 to 16 GHz Fundamental Symmetric Mode Acoustic Resonators in Piezoelectric Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 5G connectivity proliferates, signal processing applications at 6G centimeter bands have gained attention for urban wireless capacity expansion. At sub-5 GHz, acoustic resonators operating in the fundamental symmetric (S0) Lamb mode hold significant promise if frequency scaled to the 6G centimeter bands. Concurrently, the lateral wavelength dependency and the traveling wave nature of S0 mode enable monolithic multi-frequency fabrication, transversal filters, correlators, and other compact signal processing components. In this work, we present thin-film lithium niobate (LN) S0 resonators scaled up to 16 GHz. Specifically, we study the characteristics of the S0 mode as the wavelength is minimized and showcase a device at 14.9 GHz with a Bode Q maximum of 391, a k2 of 6%, and a figure of merit (FoM) of 23.33, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SoA) in its frequency range.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent increasing interest in strain balanced Type-II superlattices material causing close attention from industry. Tremendous investment was drawn toward establishing strain balanced superlattice (SLS) as new alternative for infrared photodetectors across the broad range of infrared spectrum. In recent years, SLS material system has shown capability in particular specifications to compete with mature and standard mercury cadmium telluride for mid-wavelength and long-wavelength infrared detection. It has been great interest in SLS material system for applications aligned with the standard of third generation of infrared detectors. In that level, photodetectors with multi-color detection capabilities based on SLS material system are highly desired. In this presentation, some recent progress in three color infrared photodetectors based on SLS material system will be presented.</description>

      <title>Application of Probabilistic-bit in Precision Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for precision measurement utilizing an ensemble of probabilistic bits (p-bits). This method leverages the inherent fluctuations of p-bits to achieve high sensitivity in various applications, including magnetic field sensing, temperature monitoring and timekeeping. The sensitivity scales proportionally to the square root of the total number of p-bits, enabling unprecedented accuracy with large ensembles. Furthermore, the robustness of this method against device imperfections and non-uniformity enhances its practicality and scalability. This work paves the way for a new paradigm in precision measurement, offering a cost-effective and versatile alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of lead-free bulk CsSnI$_3$ perovskite thermoelectrics via incorporating of TiS$_3$ nanoribbon clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense research for efficient low-temperature thermoelectric materials motivates the exploration of innovative compounds and composite systems. This study examines the effects of integrating low-dimensional titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) into bulk tin-based halide perovskites (CsSnI$_3$) for use in thermoelectric applications. The addition of small amounts of two-dimensional titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) to bulk tin-based halide perovskites (CsSnI$_3$) significantly enhanced the structural stability of the composite material and suppressed oxidation processes. The CsSnI$_3$-TiS$_3$ composites demonstrated stabilization of temperature-dependent electrical properties (conductivity and Seebeck coefficient). This study provides valuable insights into the promising approach of using low-dimensional TiS3 as an additive to stabilize the thermoelectric performance of CsSnI$_3$.</description>

      <title>Imaging Localized Variable Capacitance During Switching Processes in Silicon Diodes by Time-Resolved Electron Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference Gating or iGate is a unique method for ultrafast time-resolved electron holography in a transmission electron microscope enabling a spatiotemporal resolution in the nm and ns regime with a minimal technological effort. Here, iGate is used for the first image-based investigation of the local dynamics of the projected electric potential in the area of the space charge region of two different general purpose silicon diodes during switching between unbiased and reverse biased condition with a temporal resolution of $25\,\text{ns}$ at a repetition rate of $3\,\text{MHz}$. The obtained results for a focus-ion-beam-prepared ultrafast UG1A rectifier diode, which shows a decreasing capacitance with increasing reverse bias are in good agreement with an electric characterization of the macroscopic device as well as with theoretical expectations. For a severely modified 1N4007 device, however, time-resolved electron holography revealed a MOSCAP-like behavior with a rising capacitance in the area of the space charge region during the switching into reverse biased condition. Remarkably, a different behavior, dominated by the effective capacitance of the electrical setup, can be observed in the vacuum region outside both devices within the same measurements, clearly showing the benefits of localized dynamic potentiometry.</description>

      <title>Towards the reproducible fabrication of conductive ferroelectric domain walls into lithium niobate bulk single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) are promising structures for assembling future nano-electronic circuit elements on a larger scale, since reporting domain wall currents of up to 1 mA per single DW. One key requirement hereto is their reproducible manufacturing by gaining preparative control over domain size and domain wall conductivity (DWC). To date, most works on DWC have focused on exploring the fundamental electrical properties of individual DWs within single shot experiments, with emphasis on quantifying the origins for DWC. Very few reports exist when it comes to compare the DWC properties between two separate DWs, and literally nothing exists where issues of reproducibility in DWC devices have been addressed. To fill this gap while facing the challenge of finding guidelines achieving predictable DWC performance, we report on a procedure that allows us to reproducibly prepare single hexagonal domains of a predefined diameter into uniaxial ferroelectric (FE) lithium niobate (LN) single crystals of 200 and 300 micrometers thickness, respectively. We show that the domain diameter can be controlled with an error of a few percent. As-grown DWs are then subjected to a standard procedure of current-controlled high-voltage DWC enhancement, repetitively reaching a DWC increase of 6 orders of magnitude. While all resulting DWs show significantly enhanced DWC values, subtle features in their individual current-voltage (I-V) characteristics hint towards different 3D shapes into the bulk, with variations probably reflecting local heterogeneities by defects, DW pinning, and surface-near DW inclination, which seem to have a larger impact than expected.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Bandstop Filter Using Varying Radii Split-Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we report a proof-of-concept terahertz band-stop filter constructed from split-ring resonators that has a center frequency of 1.06 THz and a -3 dB bandwidth of 0.36 THz. The design consists of nine split ring resonators of varying radii (3 x 13 um, 3 x 14 um, 3 x 15 um) that are placed between the conductors of a coplanar stripline transmission line. The response of the filter is measured using a modified terahertz time-domain spectrometer and we find reasonable agreement between simulation and experiment. This work demonstrates the viability of using varying-radii split-ring resonators as discrete sub-wavelength filter elements for terahertz systems.</description>

      <title>A new ferromagnetic semiconductor system of Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ compounds: Crystallographic, magnetic, and magneto-resistive properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjusting chemical pressure through doping is a highly effective method for customizing the chemical and physical properties of materials, along with their respective phase diagrams, thereby uncovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we successfully synthesized Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ and conducted a comprehensive investigation involving crystallography, magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and PPMS DynaCool measurements, we studied Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP in detail. The hexagonal structure of parent EuAgP at room temperature, with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group, remains unaltered, while the lattice constants expand. The magnetic phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism, as temperature decreases, is suppressed through the gradual introduction of strontium doping. Heat capacity measurements reveal a shift from magnon-dominated to predominantly phonon and electron contributions near the ferromagnetic phase with increasing doping levels. The resistivity-temperature relationship displays distinct characteristics, emphasizing the impact of Sr doping on modifying charge transport. Magnetoresistance measurements uncover novel phenomena, illustrating the adjustability of magnetoresistance through Sr doping. Notably, Sr doping results in both positive magnetoresistance (up to 20\%) and negative magnetoresistance (approximately -60\%). The resistivity and magnetic phase diagram were established for the first time, revealing the pronounced feasibility of Sr doping in modulating EuAgP's resistivity. This study has provided valuable insights into the intricate interplay between structural modifications and diverse physical properties. The potential for technological advancements and the exploration of novel quantum states make Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP a compelling subject for continued research in the field of applied physics.</description>

      <title>A frequency-domain enhanced multi-view network for metal fatigue life prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fatigue damages and failure widely exist in engineering structures. However, predicting fatigue life for various structural materials subjected to multiaxial loading paths remains a challenging problem. A novel multi-view deep learning model incorporating frequency-domain analysis for fatigue life prediction is proposed. The model consists of two main analytical components: one for analyzing multiaxial fatigue loading paths and the other for examining the mechanical properties of materials and specimen geometrical characteristics. In the module analyzing multiaxial fatigue loading paths, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and FNet are connected in parallel to extract features individually. Features of materials and specimens are extracted through fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). Subsequently, the features from these two parts are thoroughly integrated based on attention mechanisms, and connected to multiple FCNNs to accomplish fatigue life prediction. A fatigue experimental database comprising 557 samples, spanning 46 multiaxial loading paths and 19 metal materials, has been established for model training and testing. Additionally, 6 materials were respectively used as test sets to evaluate the extrapolation ability of the model. The results suggest that the proposed model exhibits robust predictive performance and extrapolation capabilities. We anticipate that the multi-view approach, along with its accuracy and applicability, can provide an unparalleled alternative for researchers in the field of engineering fatigue and beyond.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven neural-network training for integrated magnetic tunnel junction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing scale of neural networks needed to support more complex applications has led to an increasing requirement for area- and energy-efficient hardware. One route to meeting the budget for these applications is to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck by performing computation in or near memory. An inevitability of transferring neural networks onto hardware is that non-idealities such as device-to-device variations or poor device yield impact performance. Methods such as hardware-aware training, where substrate non-idealities are incorporated during network training, are one way to recover performance at the cost of solution generality. In this work, we demonstrate inference on hardware neural networks consisting of 20,000 magnetic tunnel junction arrays integrated on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor chips that closely resembles market-ready spin transfer-torque magnetoresistive random access memory technology. Using 36 dies, each containing a crossbar array with its own non-idealities, we show that even a small number of defects in physically mapped networks significantly degrades the performance of networks trained without defects and show that, at the cost of generality, hardware-aware training accounting for specific defects on each die can recover to comparable performance with ideal networks. We then demonstrate a robust training method that extends hardware-aware training to statistics-aware training, producing network weights that perform well on most defective dies regardless of their specific defect locations. When evaluated on the 36 physical dies, statistics-aware trained solutions can achieve a mean misclassification error on the MNIST dataset that differs from the software-baseline by only 2 %. This statistics-aware training method could be generalized to networks with many layers that are mapped to hardware suited for industry-ready applications.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>
