      <title>Diffusion on assortative networks: from mean-field to agent-based, via Newman rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical models of epidemic diffusion on networks based upon systems of differential equations, it is convenient to use the Heterogeneous Mean Field approximation (HMF) because it allows to write one single equation for all nodes of a certain degree $k$, each one virtually present with a probability given by the degree distribution $P(k)$. The two-point correlations between nodes are defined by the matrix $P(h|k)$, which can typically be uncorrelated, assortative or disassortative. After a brief review of this approach and of the results obtained within this approximation for the Bass diffusion model, in this work we look at the transition from the HMF approximation to the description of diffusion through the dynamics of single nodes, first still with differential equations, and then with agent-based models. For this purpose, one needs a method for the explicit construction of ensembles of random networks or scale-free networks having a pre-defined degree distribution (Configuration Model) and a method for rewiring these networks towards some desired or "target" degree correlations (Newman Rewiring). We describe Python-NetworkX codes implemented for the two methods in our recent work and compare some of the results obtained in the HMF approximation with the new results obtained with statistical ensembles of real networks, including the case of signed networks.</description>

      <title>Reviewing climate change attribution in UK natural hazards and their impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Detection and Attribution is rapidly moving beyond weather and climate, and towards incorporating hazards and their impacts on natural and human systems. Here, we review the comprehensive literature base relevant for the UK ahead of the next Climate Change Risk Assessment. The current literature highlights a detectable and non-trivial influence of climate change in many UK impact sectors already - notably health, agriculture, and infrastructure. We found that heatwaves were the most studied hazard overall, with a unanimous consensus on a strong attributable signal of human-induced climate change in their increased frequency and intensity over the last century. The most notable gap identified overall was in attributing climate-related impacts to human influence, with a few impact studies for only a handful of the hazards assessed. Furthermore, just under half of the 29 hazards were not found to have any UK-relevant attribution studies, with most of the remainder having three or fewer. This review highlights requirements for and opportunities to develop attribution scicnce to meet the needs of the UK. Diversifying hazards and impacts studied, in conjunction with the techniques and approaches used, will undoubtedly benefit the community.</description>

      <title>Verhulst Equation and the Universal Pattern for the Global Population Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global population growth from 10,000 BC to 2023 is discussed within the Verhulst scaling equation and its extensions framework. The analysis focuses on per the capita global population rate coefficient Gp(P)=[dP(t)/P(t)]/dt=dlnP(t)/d, which reveals two linear domains: from 700CE till 1966 and from 1966 till 2023. Such a pattern can be considered a universal reference for reliable scaling relations describing P(t) changes. It is also the distortions-sensitive test indicating domains of their applicability and yielding optimal values of parameters. For models recalling the Verhulst equation, a single pair of growth rate and system capacity coefficients (r,s) should describe global population rise in the mentioned periods. However, the Verhulst equation with such effective parameters does not describe P(t) changes. Notable is the new way of data preparation, based on collecting data from various sources and their numerical filtering to obtain a smooth set of optimal values enabling the derivative-based analysis. The analysis reveals links between P(t) changes and some historical and pre-historical references influencing the global scale.</description>

      <title>Death, Taxes, and Inequality. Can a Minimal Model Explain Real Economic Inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Income inequalities and redistribution policies are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. The model is scaled to match human lifespans and overall death rates. Stochastic income distributions from the model are compared to empirical data from actual economies. Empirical data are fit to implied distributions providing necessary resolution for comparison. The impacts of redistribution policies on total wealth, income distributions, and inequality are shown to be similar for the empirical data and the model. These comparisons enable detailed determinations of population welfare beyond what is possible with total wealth and inequality metrics. Estate taxes in the model appear quite effective in reducing inequality without reducing total wealth. Significant income inequality emerges for the model for a population of equally capable individuals presented with equal opportunities. Stochastic population instability at both the high and low ends of infertility are considered.</description>

      <title>The Dangerous Allure of Low Fertility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic population and wealth trajectories for societies as functions of fertility are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. The model is scaled to match human lifespans and overall death rates. Stochastic population instability at both the high and low ends of fertility are considered. Lower population levels, caused by low fertility, generate concerns on economic growth, military security, and international political power; while also seen by some as reducing ecological and environmental damage. The model shows that increasingly low fertility leads to both higher wealth and lower population levels. As society is encouraged by increasing per capita wealth to continue to decrease fertility, dangerous population regimes are reached where stochastic extinction becomes more and more likely.</description>

      <title>Learning thresholds lead to stable language coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a language competition model that incorporates the effects of memory and learning on the language shift dynamics, using the Abrams-Strogatz model as a starting point. On a coarse grained time scale, the effects of memory and learning can be expressed as thresholds on the speakers fractions. In its simplest form, the resulting model is exactly solvable. Besides the consensus on one of the two languages, the model describes additional equilibrium states that are not present in the Abrams-Strogatz model: a stable coexistence of the two languages, if both thresholds are low enough, so that the language shift processes in the two opposite directions compensate each other, and a frozen state coinciding with the initial state, when both thresholds are too high for any language shift to take place. We show numerically that these results are preserved for threshold functions of a more general shape.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of NiCoMn MOFs for Wastewater Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water pollution has become a global problem. Sources of wastewater majorly include industrial and commercial sectors. To cater to the exponential increase in clean water, efficient technologies are needed to treat wastewater. Several techniques such as redox reactions, membrane filtrations, mechanical processes, chemical treatment and adsorption techniques have been employed. However, their cost and effectiveness is still a major problem. In this study, we employed an effective wastewater treatment technique by synthesizing NiCoMn MOFs using a simple hydrothermal technique and characterized the properties using XRD and SEM for their possible characteristics. XRD analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of NiCoMn MOFs. Sufficient information regarding the surface morphology and topology was given by the SEM analysis which proved a nanoporous structure with high surface area effective for adsorption and oxidative catalysis of contaminants in wastewater. Moreover, a high electrostatic attraction between the MOFs was observed which could attract oppositely charged contaminants. The results showed a high potential for the synthesized NiCoMn MOFs for wastewater treatment applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Networks: from Multipartite Entanglement to Hypergraph Immersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, a higher-order interaction unique to quantum information, offers various advantages over bipartite entanglement in quantum network (QN) applications. Establishing multipartite entanglement across remote parties in QN requires entanglement routing, which irreversibly transforms the QN topology at the cost of existing entanglement links. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

      <title>Nicer Than Humans: How do Large Language Models Behave in the Prisoner's Dilemma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) as artificial social agents is largely unexplored, and we still lack extensive evidence of how these agents react to simple social stimuli. Testing the behavior of AI agents in classic Game Theory experiments provides a promising theoretical framework for evaluating the norms and values of these agents in archetypal social situations. In this work, we investigate the cooperative behavior of Llama2 when playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma against random adversaries displaying various levels of hostility. We introduce a systematic methodology to evaluate an LLM's comprehension of the game's rules and its capability to parse historical gameplay logs for decision-making. We conducted simulations of games lasting for 100 rounds, and analyzed the LLM's decisions in terms of dimensions defined in behavioral economics literature. We find that Llama2 tends not to initiate defection but it adopts a cautious approach towards cooperation, sharply shifting towards a behavior that is both forgiving and non-retaliatory only when the opponent reduces its rate of defection below 30%. In comparison to prior research on human participants, Llama2 exhibits a greater inclination towards cooperative behavior. Our systematic approach to the study of LLMs in game theoretical scenarios is a step towards using these simulations to inform practices of LLM auditing and alignment.</description>

      <title>Using power system modelling outputs to identify weather-induced extreme events in highly renewable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In highly renewable power systems the increased weather dependence can result in new resilience challenges, such as renewable energy droughts, or a lack of sufficient renewable generation at times of high demand. The weather conditions responsible for these challenges have been well-studied in the literature. However, in reality multi-day resilience challenges are triggered by complex interactions between high demand, low renewable availability, electricity transmission constraints and storage dynamics. We show these challenges cannot be rigorously understood from an exclusively power systems, or meteorological, perspective. We propose a new method that uses electricity shadow prices - obtained by a European power system model based on 40 years of reanalysis data - to identify the most difficult periods driving system investments. Such difficult periods are driven by large-scale weather conditions such as low wind and cold temperature periods of various lengths associated with stationary high pressure over Europe. However, purely meteorological approaches fail to identify which events lead to the largest system stress over the multi-decadal study period due to the influence of subtle transmission bottlenecks and storage issues across multiple regions. These extreme events also do not relate strongly to traditional weather patterns (such as Euro-Atlantic weather regimes or the North Atlantic Oscillation index). We therefore compile a new set of weather patterns to define energy system stress events which include the impacts of electricity storage and large-scale interconnection. Without interdisciplinary studies combining state-of-the-art energy meteorology and modelling, further strive for adequate renewable power systems will be hampered.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is almost equivalent to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-monotonic. Namely, the shape parameters peak at some intermediate polling period.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>
