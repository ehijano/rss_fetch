      <title>Derivation of an Analytical Solution of a Forced Cantilevered Tube Conveying Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to obtain the forced response of a cantilevered tube conveying fluid. By considering the pipe subjected to an arbitrary harmonic force, either distributed or concentrated, an analytical solution is found using the Green's function method. The closed-form solution obtained satisfies the differential equations governing the vibrating tube conveying fluid. The proposed method, which provides exact solutions, is more accurate than the classical eigenfunction expansion or Galerkin's method and eliminates the need for eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, or infinite series.</description>

      <title>The Second Law as a constraint and admitting the approximate nature of constitutive assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for treating the Second Law of thermodynamics as a constraint and accounting for the approximate nature of constitutive assumptions in continuum thermomechanics is discussed. An unconstrained, concave, variational principle is designed for solving the resulting mathematical problem. Cases when the Second Law becomes an over-constraint on the mechanical model, as well as when it serves as a necessary constraint, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>
