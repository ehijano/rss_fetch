      <title>On the Minimisation of Deterministic and History-Deterministic Generalised (co)B\"uchi Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm minimising the number of states of history-deterministic generalised coB\"uchi automata, building on the work of Abu Radi and Kupferman on coB\"uchi automata. On the other hand, we establish that the minimisation problem for both deterministic and history-deterministic generalised B\"uchi automata is NP-complete, as well as the problem of minimising at the same time the number of states and colours of history-deterministic generalised coB\"uchi automata.</description>

      <title>Reachability for Multi-Priced Timed Automata with Positive and Negative Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-priced timed automata (MPTA) are timed automata with observer
  variables whose derivatives can change from one location to another.
  Observers are write-only variables, that is, they do not affect the control
  flow of the automaton; thus MPTA lie between timed and hybrid
  automata in expressiveness. Previous work considered observers with
  non-negative slope in every location. In this paper we treat
  observers that have both positive and negative rates. Our
  main result is an algorithm to decide a gap version of the
  reachability problem for this variant of MPTA. We translate the
  gap reachability problem into a gap satisfiability problem for mixed
  integer-real systems of nonlinear constraints. Our main technical
  contribution -- a result of independent interest -- is a procedure
  to solve such contraints via a combination of branch-and-bound
  and relaxation-and-rounding.</description>

      <title>Detecting and explaining (in)equivalence of context-free grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable framework for deciding, proving, and explaining (in)equivalence of context-free grammars. We present an implementation of the framework and evaluate it on large data sets collected within educational support systems. Even though the equivalence problem for context-free languages is undecidable in general, the framework is able to handle a large portion of these datasets. It introduces and combines techniques from several areas, such as an abstract grammar transformation language to identify equivalent grammars as well as sufficiently similar inequivalent grammars, theory-based comparison algorithms for a large class of context-free languages, and a graph-theory-inspired grammar canonization that allows to efficiently identify isomorphic grammars.</description>

      <title>A process algebraic framework for multi-agent dynamic epistemic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper combines the classical model of labeled transition systems with the epistemic model for reasoning about knowledge. The result is a unifying framework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent, knowledge-based, dynamic systems. On the modeling side, we propose a process algebraic, agent-oriented specification language that makes such a framework easy to use for practical purposes. On the verification side, we define a modal logic encompassing temporal and epistemic operators.</description>

      <title>Regular language quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce regular language states, a family of quantum many-body states. They are built from a special class of formal languages, called regular, which has been thoroughly studied in the field of computer science. They can be understood as the superposition of all the words in a regular language and encompass physically relevant states such as the GHZ-, W- or Dicke-states. By leveraging the theory of regular languages, we develop a theoretical framework to describe them. First, we express them in terms of matrix product states, providing efficient criteria to recognize them. We then develop a canonical form which allows us to formulate a fundamental theorem for the equivalence of regular language states, including under local unitary operations. We also exploit the theory of tensor networks to find an efficient criterion to determine when regular languages are shift-invariant.</description>

      <title>The Existential Theory of the Reals as a Complexity Class: A Compendium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the complexity class $\exists \mathbb{R}$, which captures the complexity of deciding the existential theory of the reals. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has roots in two different traditions, one based on the Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation, and the other following work by Mn\"{e}v and Shor on the universality of realization spaces of oriented matroids. Over the years the number of problems for which $\exists \mathbb{R}$ rather than NP has turned out to be the proper way of measuring their complexity has grown, particularly in the fields of computational geometry, graph drawing, game theory, and some areas in logic and algebra. $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has also started appearing in the context of machine learning, Markov decision processes, and probabilistic reasoning.
  We have aimed at collecting a comprehensive compendium of problems complete and hard for $\exists \mathbb{R}$, as well as a long list of open problems. The compendium is presented in the third part of our survey; a tour through the compendium and the areas it touches on makes up the second part. The first part introduces the reader to the existential theory of the reals as a complexity class, discussing its history, motivation and prospects as well as some technical aspects.</description>

      <title>Parametric Timed Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a log and a specification, timed pattern matching aims at exhibiting for which start and end dates a specification holds on that log. For example, "a given action is always followed by another action before a given deadline". This problem has strong connections with monitoring real-time systems. We address here timed pattern matching in the presence of an uncertain specification, i.e., that may contain timing parameters (e.g., the deadline can be uncertain or unknown). We want to know for which start and end dates, and for what values of the timing parameters, a property holds. For instance, we look for the minimum or maximum deadline (together with the corresponding start and end dates) for which the property holds. We propose two frameworks for parametric timed pattern matching. The first one is based on parametric timed model checking. In contrast to most parametric timed problems, the solution is effectively computable. The second one is a dedicated method; not only we largely improve the efficiency compared to the first method, but we further propose optimizations with skipping. Our experiment results suggest that our algorithms, especially the second one, are efficient and practically relevant.</description>

      <title>History-deterministic Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the notion of history-determinism in the context of timed automata (TA) over infinite timed words. History-deterministic (HD) automata are those in which nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly, based on the run constructed thus far. History-determinism is a robust property that admits different game-based characterisations, and HD specifications allow for game-based verification without an expensive determinization step.
  We show that the class of timed $\omega$-languages recognized by HD timed automata strictly extends that of deterministic ones, and is strictly included in those recognised by fully non-deterministic TA.
  For non-deterministic timed automata it is known that universality is already undecidable for safety/reachability TA. For history-deterministic TA with arbitrary parity acceptance, we show that timed universality, inclusion, and synthesis all remain decidable and are EXPTIME-complete.
  For the subclass of TA with safety or reachability acceptance, one can decide (in EXPTIME) whether such an automaton is history-deterministic. If so, it can effectively determinized without introducing new automata states.</description>

      <title>Model-bounded monitoring of hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs) -- the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms -- one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra -- and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant.</description>
