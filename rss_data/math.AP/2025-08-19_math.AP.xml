      <title>Subsolution theorem in weighted energy classes of $m$-subharmonic functions with given boundary value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the existence of solutions of the weighted complex $m$-Hessian equation $-\chi(u)H_{m}(u)=\mu$ in the class $\mathcal{E}_{m,\chi}(f,\Omega)$ if there exists subsolution in this class, where the given boundary value $f\in\mathcal{E}_m(\Omega)\cap MSH_m(\Om).$ This is a generalization of the result in the paper \cite{PDtaiwan} where we proved that the subsolution theorem is true in the class $\mathcal{E}_{m,\chi}(f,\Omega)$ in the case when the given boundary value $f\in\mathcal{N}_m(\Omega)\cap MSH_m(\Om).$</description>

      <title>Well- and Ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem for derivative fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for derivative fractional Schr\"odinger equations (fNLS) on the torus $\mathbb T$. Recently, the second and third authors established a necessary and sufficient condition on the nonlinearity for well-posedness of semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb T$. In this paper, we extend this result to derivative fNLS. More precisely, we prove that the necessary and sufficient condition on the nonlinearity is the same as that for semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations. However, since we can not employ a gauge transformation for derivative fNLS, we use the modified energy method to prove well-posedness. We need to inductively construct correction terms for the modified energy when the fractional Laplacian is of order between $1$ and $\frac 32$. For the ill-posedness, we prove the non-existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem by exploiting a Cauchy-Riemann-type operator that appears in nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Solving the Laplace Equation and Applications in Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines solutions to the Laplace equation using analytical techniques, including separation of variables and the Poisson integral formula, and probabilistic methods, such as Brownian motion. We address applications to imaging, including noise reduction, data interpolation, and resolution enhancement, as well as discuss theoretical connections between the Laplace equation, specifically concepts such as harmonic functions, the mean value property, and the maximum principle, to provide a mathematical framework for practical implementation in imaging workflows.</description>

      <title>Stability threshold of Couette flow for Boussinesq equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic stability threshold for the Couette flow $(y,0)$ under the 2D Boussinesq system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. It was proved that for initial perturbations in Sobolev spaces with controlled low horizontal frequencies, the stability threshold is at most $\left\{\frac{1}{3}+, \frac{2}{3}+\right\}$, extending the known threshold results from the periodic case $\mathbb{T}_x \times \mathbb{R}_y$ to the whole space. The core innovations are twofold: First, the $\langle D_x^{-1} \rangle$ control on the initial data simultaneously resolves horizontal frequency singularities and optimizes integral indices when applying Young's convolution inequality. Second, we develop a modified multiplier $\mathcal{M}_3$ that effectively absorbs the $|D_x|^{1/3}$ derivative structure induced by the temperature equation while handling nonlinear echo cascades.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates of wave equations in un-isotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove decay estimates for solutions to non-isotropic linear systems of wave equations. The defining feature of these estimates is that they depend only on the commutation properties of the system with the scaling vector field. As application we give two surprisingly simple proofs for small data global regularity results non-isotropic systems of wave equations in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ with cubic semilinear nonlinearities. We hope that the techniques presented here are relevant for the more difficult and important case of biaxial refraction in crystal optics.</description>

      <title>Solvability of Euler equations in the fractional Sobolev spaces in a bounded smooth domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler equations are the basic system in fluid dynamics describing the motion of incompressible and inviscid ideal fluids. For a bounded smooth domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The well-posedness of Euler equations is well-known in Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ with the integer $k&gt;\frac{n}{p}+1,\, 1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. In this article, we study the well-posedness of Euler equations in fractional Sobolev spaces on a bounded smooth domain. We first give a priori estimates of Euler equations in fractional Hilbert-Sobolev spaces by using the energy method. For the general case of fractional Sobolev spaces, we use the characteristic method together with elliptic estimates to give similar estimates. Finally, using the a priori estimate obtained we give solvability of Euler equations in fractional Sobolev spaces. Similar to the classical case, our result is global in time in the case of two dimensions and local in the three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A min-max variational approach to the existence of gravity water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of gravity water waves by applying a mountain pass theorem to a singular perturbation of the Alt-Caffarelli functional associated with the two-dimensional water wave equations. Our approach is formulated entirely in physical coordinates and does not require the air phase to be connected, nor does it rely on symmetry or monotonicity in the $x$ or $y$ directions. The framework presented allows for both a variational approach to a variety of fluid equilibrium problems and for construction of min-max solutions to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject matter of this paper concerns the magnetic confinement of plasma. We investigate the long time behavior of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck system under the effect of a strong external magnetic field. We first formally derive an asymptotically reduced model. In three space dimensions, a constraint occurs along the parallel direction to the magnetic field. To eliminate the corresponding Lagrange multiplier, we then study the Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck system in two spatial dimensions and three velocity dimensions. In this setting, we show that the obtained asymptotic model defines a well-posed dynamical system, and we provide a rigorous mathematical justification of the formally derived system. Our proofs rely on the modulated energy method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a regularity theory for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with external forces through scaling analysis. Inspired by the existing methodology, we utilize linearized approximations and the monotonicity property of harmonic functions to construct iterative sequences capturing scaling properties. This work successfully extends Navier-Stokes techniques to MHD coupling and demonstrates that the one dimensional parabolic Hausdorff measure of the possible singular points for the suitable weak solutions is zero.</description>

      <title>Dielectric scattering resonances for high-refractive resonators with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the analysis of nonlinear dielectric resonances in wave scattering by high-index resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearities. We consider both two- and three-dimensional settings and prove the existence of nonlinear dielectric resonances in the subwavelength regime, bifurcating from the zero solution at the corresponding linear resonances. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic expansions for the nonlinear resonances and states in terms of the high contrast parameter $\tau$ and the normalization constant. For a symmetric dimer of resonators, these small-amplitude nonlinear resonant states exhibit either symmetric or antisymmetric profiles. In three dimensions, under conditions valid in the dilute regime, we prove that as the field amplitude increases, mode hybridization induces a symmetry-breaking bifurcation along the principal symmetric solution branch at a critical amplitude. This bifurcation gives rise to two asymmetric resonant states, each localized on one of the particles in the dimer. Remarkably, in two dimensions, we show that no such symmetry-breaking bifurcation exists along the principal solution branches, owing to the distinct scaling behavior of the principal nonlinear subwavelength resonance arising from the logarithmic singularity.</description>

      <title>Prey-taxis VS a Shortwave External Signal in Multiple Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of the predator--prey community with prey-taxis. By that we mean the capability of the predators to get moving in a certain direction on the macroscopic level in response to the prey density gradients. Additionally, we suppose the same kind of sensitivity with respect to one more signal, called external, the production of which goes on independently of the community state. Such a signal can be due to the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of the environment that results from the natural or artificial reasons. The model employs the Patlak--Keller--Segel law for responses to both ones. We assume that the external signal takes a general short-wave form, and we construct the complete asymptotic expansions of the short-wave solutions. This result generalizes the prior one by Morgulis \&amp; Malal (2025) in two respects. First, we have addressed the case of multiple dimensions. Second, we have got rid of assuming the signal and corresponding solutions to take the form of a traveling wave, that makes our result novel even in one dimension. Further, we apply the short wave asymptotic to studying the stability or instability imposed by the external signal following Kapitza' theory for upside-down pendulum.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonhomogeneous fractional $p$-Laplace equations defined on a bounded nonsmooth domain which goes beyond the Lipschitz category. Under a sufficient flatness assumption on the domain in the sense of Reifenberg, we establish several fine boundary regularity results for solutions, and their gradient, near the boundary. To the best of our knowledge, each of our results is new even in the linear case.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for the insulated conductivity problem with partially flat inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the insulated conductivity problem with inclusions embedded in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It was known that in the setting of strictly convex inclusions, the gradient of solutions may blow up as the distance between inclusions approaches 0. The optimal blow-up rate was proved in [10] and was achieved in the presence of a uniform background gradient field. In this paper, we demonstrate that when the inclusions are partially flat, the gradient of solutions does not blow up under any uniform background fields.</description>

      <title>The new observations about the parameter-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence results of solutions for the following Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system involving different potentials:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u+V(x)u-\lambda \phi u=f(u)&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3,
  -\Delta\phi=u^2&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  We first consider the case that the potential $V$ is positive and radial so that the mountain pass theorem could be implied. The other case is that the potential $V$ is coercive and sign-changing, which means that the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta +V$ is allowed to be indefinite. To deal with this more difficult case, by a local linking argument and Morse theory, the system has a nontrivial solution. Furthermore, we also show the asymptotical behavior result of this solution. Additionally, the proofs rely on new observations regarding the solutions of the Poisson equation. As a main novelty with respect to corresponding results in \cite{MR4527586,MR3148130,MR2810583}, we only assume that $f$ satisfies the super-linear growth condition at the origin. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Right and Wrong Ans\"atze for Nonlinear Waves in Stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate the possibility that explicit solutions of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations can be found by multiplying the deterministic travelling waves with a stochastic exponent. This approach has become widespread in the literature in recent years. I will conclude that this approach is, in general, not a valid Ansatz and only works in the case of NLS-type equations in the Stratonovich interpretation.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and ill-posedness of the primitive equations with fractional horizontal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primitive equations (PE) are a fundamental model in geophysical fluid dynamics. While the viscous PE are globally well-posed, their inviscid counterparts are known to be ill-posed.
  In this paper, we study the two-dimensional incompressible PE with fractional horizontal dissipation. We identify a sharp transition between local well-posedness and ill-posedness at the critical dissipation exponent $\alpha = 1$. In the critical regime, this dichotomy exhibits a new phenomenon: the transition depends delicately on the balance between the size of the initial data and the viscosity coefficient. Our results precisely quantify the horizontal dissipation required to transition from inviscid instability to viscous regularity. We also establish a global well-posedness theory to the fractional PE, with sufficient dissipation $\alpha\geq\frac65$.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions for Steady Triple-Deck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple-deck structures arise in boundary-layer flows when small localized wall perturbations induce moderate mean-flow distortion. Most existing studies in this field focus on the derivations of the asymptotic and numerical solutions of this system, while rigorous mathematical results remain scarce. In this paper, we establish, for the first time, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the steady triple-deck equations. The steady triple-deck equations can be reduced to an Airy equation with frequency as a parameter via Fourier transformation. The main difficulty is that the Airy equation degenerates at zero frequency, hindering uniform estimates of the solution with respect to the frequency parameter. A key contribution is that we find a subtle function involving the distribution of zeros of the Bessel function to overcome the degeneracy by analyzing the structure of the Airy function. Additionally, we derive a higher-frequency estimate and modify an elliptic multiplier to obtain uniform estimates of the solution.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian Minkowski problem for epigraphs of convex functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variational formula is derived by combining the Gaussian volume of the epigraph of a convex function $\varphi$ and the perturbation of $\varphi$ via the infimal convolution. This formula naturally leads to a Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a Borel measure on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. The resulting Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will be called the Euclidean Gaussian moment measure of the convex function $\varphi$, and the related Minkowski-type problem will be studied. In particular, the newly posed Minkowski problem is solved under some mild and natural conditions on the pre-given measure.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Regularity and pointwise convergence for dispersive equations on $\mathbb{H}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the prototypical setting of non-Euclidean geometry, the 2-dimensional Real Hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^2$, we consider the Carleson's problem for the Schr\"odinger equation and improve the best known result until now by proving that the Sobolev regularity threshold $\beta \ge 1/2$ for the initial data, is sufficient to obtain pointwise convergence of the solution a.e. on $\mathbb{H}^2$. In fact, we prove the same bound for a wide class of dispersive equations that include the fractional Schr\"odinger equations with convex phase, the Boussinesq equation and the Beam equation, also known as the fourth order Wave equation. For the Schr\"odinger equation, we improve the result of Wang-Zhang (Canad J Math 71(4), 983-995, 2019) and for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations with convex phase, we improve the result of Cowling (Lecture Notes Math 992, 83-90, 1983).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate monotonicity properties of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian in polyhedral layers of fixed width. We establish that eigenvalues below the essential spectrum threshold monotonically depend on geometric parameters defining the polyhedral layer, generalizing previous results known for planar V-shaped waveguides and conical layers. Moreover, we demonstrate non-monotone spectral behavior arising from asymmetric geometric perturbations, providing an explicit example where unfolding the polyhedral angle unexpectedly leads to the emergence of discrete eigenvalues. The limiting behavior of eigenvalues as the geometric parameters approach critical configurations is also rigorously analyzed.</description>

      <title>The Leibenson process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Leibenson equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u = \Delta_p u^q, \end{equation*} where $\Delta_p f = div(|\nabla f|^{p-2}\nabla f)$ for $p&gt;1$ and $q&gt;0$, which is a simultaneous generalization of the porous media and the $p$-Laplace equation. In this paper we identify the Leibenson equation as a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation and prove that it has a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean as its probabilistic counterpart. More precisely, we obtain a probabilistic representation of its Barenblatt solutions as the one-dimensional marginal density curve of the unique solutions to the associated McKean--Vlasov SDE. The latter is of novel type, since its coefficients depend pointwise both on its solution's time marginal densities and also on their first and second order derivatives. Moreover, we show that these solutions constitute the aforementioned nonlinear Markov process, which we call the Leibenson process. A further main result of this work is to prove that despite the strong degeneracy of the diffusion and the irregularity of the drift coefficient (which is merely of bounded variation) of the McKean--Vlasov SDE these solutions are probabilistically strong, i.e., measurable functionals of the driving Brownian motion and the initial condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy in inhomogeneous media. Both the energy and media can depend on the spatial variable in a fast oscillatory manner. In particular, we show that the gradient-flow structure is preserved in the limit which is expressed in terms of an effective energy and Wasserstein metric. The gradient flow and its limiting behavior are analyzed through an energy dissipation inequality (EDI). The result is consistent with asymptotic analysis in the realm of homogenization. However, we note that the effective metric is in general different from that obtained from the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces. We apply our framework to a linear Fokker-Planck equation but we believe the approach is robust enough to be applicable in a broader context.</description>

Abstract: Interference of randomly scattered classical waves naturally leads to familiar speckle patterns, where the wave intensity follows an exponential distribution while the wave field itself is described by a circularly symmetric complex normal distribution. In the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave beam propagation, we demonstrate how a deterministic incident beam transitions to such a fully developed speckle pattern over long distances in the so-called scintillation (weak-coupling) regime.</description>

      <title>Rigorous fast signal diffusion limit and convergence rates with the initial layer effect in a competitive chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis system that includes two competitive prey and one predator species in a two-dimensional domain, where the movement of prey (resp. predators) is driven by chemicals secreted by predators (resp. prey), called mutually repulsive (resp. mutually attractive) chemotactic effect. The kinetics for all species are chosen according to the competitive Lotka--Volterra equations for prey and to a Holling type functional response for the predator. Under the biologically relevant scenario that the chemicals diffuse much faster than the individual diffusion of all species and a suitable re-scaling, equations for chemical concentrations are parabolic with slow evolution depending on the relaxation time $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$. The first main result shows the global existence of a unique classical solution to the system for each $\varepsilon$. Second, we study rigorously the so-called fast signal diffusion limit, passing from the system including parabolic equations with the slow evolution of the chemical concentrations to elliptic equations for the chemical concentrations, i.e. the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This explains why elliptic equations can be proposed for chemical concentration instead of parabolic ones with slow evolution. Third, the $L^\infty$-in-time convergence rates for the fast signal diffusion limit are estimated, where the effect of the initial layer is carefully treated. Finally, the differences between the systems with and without the slow evolution, and between the systems with one or two prey, as well as their dynamics, are discussed numerically.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic behaviors of chemical reactions can be described by a random time-changed Poisson process, whose large-volume limit determines the macroscopic behaviors of species concentrations, including both typical and non-typical trajectories. When the reaction intensities (or fluxes) exhibit a separation of fast-slow scales, the macroscopic typical trajectory is governed by a system of $\varepsilon$-dependent nonlinear reaction rate equations (RRE), while the non-typical trajectories deviating from the typical ones are characterized by an $\varepsilon$-dependent exponentially nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). In this paper, for general chemical reactions, we study the fast-slow limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$ for the viscosity solutions of the associated HJE with a state-constrained boundary condition. We identify the limiting effective HJE on a slow manifold, along with an effective variational representation for the solution. Through the uniform convergence of the viscosity solutions and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the variational solution representations, we rigorously show that all non-typical (and also typical) trajectories are concentrated on the slow manifold and the effective macroscopic dynamics are described by the coarse-grained RRE and HJE, respectively. This approach for studying the fast-slow limit is applicable to, but not limited to, reversible chemical reactions described by gradient flows.</description>

Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present new mathematical developments on the analysis of de Gennes' hypothesis on the short-time asymptotics of the heat content for bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary and the results discussed here are small initial contributions towards a resolution.</description>

Abstract: We study standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a discrete graph. We characterize for a self-adjoint realizations of Schr\"odinger operators conditions related with the geometry of the graph that guarantee discreteness of the spectrum and study ground states on the generalized Nehari manifold in order to prove the existence of standing wave solutions in the self-focusing and defocusing case. In this context, we show properties of the solutions, such as integrability. Finally, we discuss decay properties of solutions and the bifurcation of solutions from the trivial solution.</description>

      <title>Kac's Program for the Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the derivation of the spatially homogeneous Landau equation from the mean-field limit of a conservative $N$-particle system, obtained by passing to the grazing limit on Kac's walk in his program for the Boltzmann equation. Our result covers the full range of interaction potentials, including the physically important Coulomb case. This provides the first resolution of propagation of chaos for a many-particle system approximating the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions, and the first extension of Kac's program to the Landau equation in the soft potential regime. The convergence is established in weak, Wasserstein, and entropic senses, together with strong $L^1$ convergence. To handle the singularity of soft potentials, we extend the duality approach of Bresch-Duerinckx-Jabin \cite{bresch2024duality} and establish key functional inequalities, including an extended commutator estimate and a new second-order Fisher information estimate.</description>

      <title>Parabolic abstract evolution equations in cylindrical domains and uniformly local Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider parabolic equations of the type $$\partial_t u(x,t)=\Delta u(x,t) - Bu(x,t) + F(u(x,t))$$ where $u$ is valued in a transverse Hilbert space $Y$ and $B$ is a positive self-adjoint operator on $Y$, allowing a different diffusion mechanism in the transverse direction. We aim at considering solutions with infinite energy and we study the Cauchy problem in the uniformly local spaces associated with the norm $$\|u\|_{L^2_{\text{ul}}(\mathbb{R},Y)}= \sup_{a\in\mathbb{R}^d} \|u(x)\|_{L^2(B(a,1),Y)}.$$ For the classical parabolic equation, i.e. if $Y=\mathbb{R}$, it is known that the Cauchy problem is ill-posed in the weak version of the uniformly local spaces but well-posed in a stronger version, where additional uniform continuity is required. In this paper, we show that the linear operator $\partial^2_{xx} - B$ is not necessarily a sectorial operator in any version of the uniformly local Lebesgue space, due to the possible non-density of its domain. Then, we use the theory of parabolic abstract evolution equations to set a well-posed Cauchy problem, even in the weak version of the uniformly local space. In particular, we believe that this paper offers a new perspective on the comparison between both versions of the uniformly local spaces and also provides a new natural example of differential operators with non-dense domain.</description>

      <title>Global eigenfamilies on closed manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study globally defined $(\lambda,\mu)$-eigenfamilies on closed Riemannian manifolds. Among others, we provide (non-)existence results for such eigenfamilies, examine their topological properties and classify $(\lambda,\mu)$-eigenfamilies on flat tori. It is further shown that for $f=f_1+i f_2$ being an eigenfunction decomposed into its real and its imaginary part, the powers $\{f_1^a f_2^b\mid a,b\in\mathbb N\}$ satisfy highly rigid orthogonality relations in $L^2(M)$. In establishing these orthogonality relations one is led to combinatorial identities involving determinants of products of binomials, which we view as being of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation: Global solution and invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by both additive and multiplicative noises is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, spin current, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a unique pathwise solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove the convergence of this pathwise solution to that of the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation in the limit of vanishing exchange relaxation parameter. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, and prove the existence of nontrivial invariant measures. For temperatures above the Curie temperature, exponential stability of the solution and uniqueness of invariant measure are obtained under certain dissipativity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Donaldson-Scaduto conjecture predicts the existence and uniqueness of a special Lagrangian pair of pants with three asymptotically cylindrical ends in the Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X \times \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is an ALE hyperk\"ahler 4-manifold of $A_2$-type. The existence of this special Lagrangian has previously been proved. In this paper, we prove a uniqueness theorem, showing that no other special Lagrangian pair of pants satisfies this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>
