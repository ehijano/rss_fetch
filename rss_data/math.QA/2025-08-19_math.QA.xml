      <title>A Quantum Analogue of the Pfaffian-Determinant Identity, An Algebraic and Geometric Study in the q-Skew-Symmetric Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a quantum deformation of the classical identity Pf(A)^2 = det(A) for 2n by 2n skew-symmetric matrices A, which classically relates the square of the Pfaffian to the determinant. In the quantum setting, we study matrices whose entries lie in a noncommutative algebra and satisfy the q-skew-symmetry relations a_ji = -q times a_ij and a_ii = 0, where q is a nonzero complex parameter. This deformation introduces new algebraic structures and challenges in defining quantum analogues of classical invariants.
  We construct the quantum Pfaffian Pf_q(A) and quantum determinant det_q(A) using two main approaches: the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) construction and quantum exterior algebras. We provide precise definitions, derive algebraic identities, and analyze properties of these quantum objects. Special attention is given to verifying the quantum analogue of the Pfaffian-determinant identity, q to the power c times Pf_q(A)^2 = det_q(A), in low-dimensional cases such as 2n = 4, using explicit symbolic computations.
  We also explore geometric interpretations within the context of braided vector spaces, quantum symplectic geometry, and deformations of volume forms. The paper includes examples and diagrams highlighting connections between combinatorics, representation theory, and noncommutative geometry. Potential applications are discussed in quantum invariant theory, low-dimensional topology, and categorified geometry. These results contribute to the broader understanding of quantum analogues of classical linear algebra and their role in quantum group theory.</description>

      <title>Intertwiners of Yangian representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct type $g\ell(n)$ Yangian algebra evaluations of order $N$ embedded in Heisenberg algebras and consider their representations having a highest weight. These Yangian algebra presentations depend on $nN$ parameters. We construct explicitly intertwiners, which exist if the parameter arrays are related by permutations. The intertwiners are products of elementary adjacent parameter permutation operators derived from $R$ operators obeying Yang-Baxter relations. Permutation coefficients appear in the action on representations. Their dependence on the parameters allows to distinguish the types of representations.</description>

      <title>Relative braid group symmetries on modified $\mathrm{i}$quantum groups and their modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive generalization of Lusztig's braid group symmetries for quasi-split iquantum groups. Specifically, we give 3 explicit rank one formulas for symmetries acting on integrable modules over a quasi-split iquantum group of arbitrary Kac-Moody type with general parameters. These symmetries are formulated in terms of idivided powers and iweights of the vectors being acted upon. We show that these symmetries are consistent with the relative braid group symmetries on iquantum groups, and they are also related to Lusztig's symmetries via quasi $K$-matrices. Furthermore, through appropriate rescaling, we obtain compatible symmetries for the integral forms of modified iquantum groups and their integrable modules. We verify that these symmetries satisfy the relative braid group relations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\EuScript{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\EuScript{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\EuScript{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\EuScript{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\EuScript{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\EuScript{B}$ of $\EuScript{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\EuScript{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\EuScript{B}$ to $A^\EuScript{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\EuScript{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\EuScript{C}_A}$ where $\EuScript{C}=\EuScript{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\EuScript{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>

      <title>Line Operators in 3d Holomorphic QFT: Meromorphic Tensor Categories and dg-Shifted Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study line operators and their OPE's in perturbative 3d holomorphic-topological QFT's, including holomorphic-topological twists (quarter-BPS sectors) of 3d $N=2$ theories. In particular, we develop the representation theory of the category $C$ of perturbative line operators and its chiral tensor product, by generalizing techniques introduced by Costello and collaborators. We argue that lines are equivalent to modules for an $A_\infty$ algebra $A^!$ that's Koszul-dual to bulk local operators. We further establish a non-renormalization theorem for the OPE's of lines in a large class of theories (dubbed quasi-linear), allowing an exact resummation of quantum corrections. Based on physics arguments, we propose axioms for the full algebraic structure on $A^!$, calling it a "dg-shifted Yangian," which controls the OPE of lines. A key part of the structure is a Maurer-Cartan element $r(z)\in A^!\otimes A^!(\!(z^{-1})\!)$ that satisfies an $A_\infty$ generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. As examples, we consider 3d $N=2$ gauge theories with arbitrary Chern-Simons levels, linear matter, and superpotential, and explicitly compute 1) perturbative bulk local operators (as $A_\infty$-chiral algebras); and 2) the Koszul-duals $A^!$ (proving they are dg-shifted Yangians).</description>

      <title>On Modular maximal-cyclic braces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a conjecture by Guarnieri and Vendramin concerning the number of braces with a generalized quaternion adjoint group, many researchers have studied braces whose adjoint group is a non-abelian $2$-group with a cyclic subgroup of index $2$. Following this direction, braces with generalized quaternion, dihedral, and semidihedral adjoint groups have been classified. It was found that the number of such braces stabilizes as the group order increases. In this paper, we consider the remaining open case of modular maximal-cyclic groups. We show that these braces possess only one non-cyclic additive group structure, and, in contrast to previous findings, the number of such braces increases with increasing order.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras IV: Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <title>On the compatibility of the Betti harmonic coproduct with cyclotomic filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the second author introduced a Betti counterpart of $N$-cyclotomic double shuffle theory for any $N \geq 1$. The construction is based on the group algebra of the free group $F_2$, endowed with a filtration relative to a morphism $F_2 \to \mu_N$ (where $\mu_N$ is the group of $N$-th roots of unity). One of the main results therein is the construction of a complete Hopf algebra coproduct $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$ on the relative completion of a specific subalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ of the group algebra of $F_2$. However, an explicit formula for this coproduct is missing. In this paper, we show that the discrete Betti harmonic coproduct $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ defined in \cite{EF1} for the classical case ($N=1$) by the first author and Furusho remains compatible with the filtration structure on $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ induced by the relative completion for arbitrary $N$. This compatibility suggests that the completion corresponding to $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ is a candidate for an explicit realization of $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of partially symmetric polynomials, which we call quantum corner polynomials, as a generalization of the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We show that these quantum corner polynomials are precisely the partially symmetric polynomials corresponding to the quantum corner VOAs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of the partial symmetricity of these polynomials.</description>

      <title>An introduction to representation-theoretic canonical bases of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to noninvolutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.03938v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study noninvolutive set-theoretic solutions $(X,r)$ of the Yang-Baxter equations in terms of the properties of the canonically associated algebraic objects-the braided monoid $S(X,r)$, the quadratic Yang-Baxter algebra $A= A(\textbf{k}, X, r)$ over a field $\textbf{k}$ and its Koszul dual, $A^{!}$. More generally, we continue our systematic study of nondegenerate quadratic sets $(X,r)$ and the associated algebraic objects. Next we investigate the class of (noninvolutive) square-free solutions $(X,r)$. It contains the special class of self distributive solutions (quandles). We make a detailed characterization in terms of various algebraic and combinatorial properties each of which shows the contrast between involutive and noninvolutive square-free solutions. We introduce and study a class of finite square-free braided sets $(X,r)$ of order $n\geq 3$ which satisfy "the minimality condition \textbf{M}", that is $\dim_{\textbf{k}} A_2 =2n-1$. Examples are some simple racks of prime order $p$. Finally, we discuss general extensions of solutions and introduce the notion of "a generalized strong twisted union of braided sets". We prove that if $(Z,r)$ is a non-degenerate 2-cancellative braided set splitting as $Z = X\natural^{\ast} Y$, then its braided monoid $S_Z$ is a generalized strong twisted union $S_Z= S_X\natural^{\ast} S_Y$ of the braided monoids $S_X$ and $S_Y$. Moreover, if $(Z,r)$ is injective then its braided group $G_Z=G(Z,r)$ also splits as $G_Z= G_X\natural^{\ast} G_Y$ of the associated braided groups of $X$ and $Y$. We propose a construction of a generalized strong twisted union $Z = X\natural^{\ast} Y$ of braided sets $(X,r_X)$, and $(Y, r_Y)$, where the map $r$ has high, explicitly prescribed order.</description>

Abstract: We look at the Poisson structure on the total space of the dual bundle to the Lie algebroid arising from a matched pair of Lie groups. This dual bundle, with the natural semidirect product group structure, becomes a Poisson-Lie group as suggested by a recent work of Stachura. Moreover, when we start from matched pairs given by the Iwasawa decomposition of simple Lie groups, the associated Lie bialgebra is coboundary.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>
