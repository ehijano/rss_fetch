      <title>Interconnected Markets: Exploring the Dynamic Relationship Between BRICS Stock Markets and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses data from the BRICS stock market index, cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment indicators from January 6, 2015, to June 29, 2023. BRICS nations emerge as pivotal representatives of emerging economies. This study employs a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model to unravel the intricate interdependence between traditional stock assets and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. The analysis investigates spillover effects between BRICS stock markets and cryptocurrencies, revealing increasing interconnectedness during highly uncertain events like COVID-19, but no significant impact on major US stock market indices.</description>

      <title>Effective experience rating for large insurance portfolios via surrogate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experience rating in insurance uses a Bayesian credibility model to upgrade the current premiums of a contract by taking into account policyholders' attributes and their claim history. Most data-driven models used for this task are mathematically intractable, and premiums must be obtained through numerical methods such as simulation via MCMC. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and even prohibitive for large portfolios when applied at the policyholder level. Additionally, these computations become ``black-box" procedures as there is no analytical expression showing how the claim history of policyholders is used to upgrade their premiums. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a surrogate modeling approach to inexpensively derive an analytical expression for computing the Bayesian premiums for any given model, approximately. As a part of the methodology, the paper introduces a \emph{likelihood-based summary statistic} of the policyholder's claim history that serves as the main input of the surrogate model and that is sufficient for certain families of distribution, including the exponential dispersion family. As a result, the computational burden of experience rating for large portfolios is reduced through the direct evaluation of such analytical expression, which can provide a transparent and interpretable way of computing Bayesian premiums.</description>

      <title>A Multi-step Approach for Minimizing Risk in Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges are becoming even more predominant in today's finance. Driven by the need to study this phenomenon from an academic perspective, the SIAG/FME Code Quest 2023 was announced. Specifically, participating teams were asked to implement, in Python, the basic functions of an Automated Market Maker and a liquidity provision strategy in an Automated Market Maker to minimize the Conditional Value at Risk, a critical measure of investment risk. As the competition's winning team, we highlight our approach in this work. In particular, as the dependence of the final return on the initial wealth distribution is highly non-linear, we cannot use standard ad-hoc approaches. Additionally, classical minimization techniques would require a significant computational load due to the cost of the target function. For these reasons, we propose a three-step approach. In the first step, the target function is approximated by a Kernel Ridge Regression. Then, the approximating function is minimized. In the final step, the previously discovered minimum is utilized as the starting point for directly optimizing the desired target function. By using this procedure, we can both reduce the computational complexity and increase the accuracy of the solution. Finally, the overall computational load is further reduced thanks to an algorithmic trick concerning the returns simulation and the usage of Cython.</description>
