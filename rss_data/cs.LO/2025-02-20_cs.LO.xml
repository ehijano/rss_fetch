      <title>On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Planning Using Probabilistic Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent planning under stochastic dynamics is usually formalised using decentralized (partially observable) Markov decision processes ( MDPs) and reachability or expected reward specifications. In this paper, we propose a different approach: we use an MDP describing how a single agent operates in an environment and probabilistic hyperproperties to capture desired temporal objectives for a set of decentralized agents operating in the environment. We extend existing approaches for model checking probabilistic hyperproperties to handle temporal formulae relating paths of different agents, thus requiring the self-composition between multiple MDPs. Using several case studies, we demonstrate that our approach provides a flexible and expressive framework to broaden the specification capabilities with respect to existing planning techniques. Additionally, we establish a close connection between a subclass of probabilistic hyperproperties and planning for a particular type of Dec-MDPs, for both of which we show undecidability. This lays the ground for the use of existing decentralized planning tools in the field of probabilistic hyperproperty verification.</description>

      <title>Deontic Action Logics: A Modular Algebraic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work, K. Segerberg introduced a deontic logic called DAL to investigate normative reasoning over actions. DAL marked the beginning of a new area of research in Deontic Logic by shifting the focus from deontic operators on propositions to deontic operators on actions. In this work, we revisit DAL and provide a complete algebraization for it. In our algebraization we introduce deontic action algebras -- algebraic structures consisting of a Boolean algebra for interpreting actions, a Boolean algebra for interpreting formulas, and two mappings from one Boolean algebra to the other interpreting the deontic concepts of permission and prohibition. We elaborate on how the framework underpinning deontic action algebras enables the derivation of different deontic action logics by removing or imposing additional conditions over either of the Boolean algebras. We leverage this flexibility to demonstrate how we can capture in this framework several logics in the DAL family. Furthermore, we introduce four variations of DAL by: (a) enriching the algebra of formulas with propositions on states, (b) adopting a Heyting algebra for state propositions, (c) adopting a Heyting algebra for actions, and (d) adopting Heyting algebras for both. We illustrate these new deontic action logics with examples and establish their algebraic completeness.</description>

      <title>Fracterm Calculus for Partial Meadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial algebras and datatypes are discussed with the use of signatures that allow partial functions, and a three-valued short-circuit (sequential) first order logic with a Tarski semantics. The propositional part of this logic is also known as McCarthy calculus and has been studied extensively.
  Axioms for the fracterm calculus of partial meadows are given. The case is made that in this way a rather natural formalisation of fields with division operator is obtained. It is noticed that the logic thus obtained cannot express that division by zero must be undefined.
  An interpretation of the three-valued sequential logic into $\bot$-enlargements of partial algebras is given, for which it is concluded that the consequence relation of the former logic is semi-computable, and that the $\bot$-enlargement of a partial meadow is a common meadow.</description>

      <title>Reachability in 3-VASS is Elementary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reachability problem in 3-dimensional vector addition systems with states (3-VASS) is known to be PSpace-hard, and to belong to Tower. We significantly narrow down the complexity gap by proving the problem to be solvable in doubly-exponential space. The result follows from a new upper bound on the length of the shortest path: if there is a path between two configurations of a 3-VASS then there is also one of at most triply-exponential length. We show it by introducing a novel technique of approximating the reachability sets of 2-VASS by small semi-linear sets.</description>

      <title>On Bisimilarity for Quasi-discrete Closure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closure spaces, a generalisation of topological spaces, have shown to be a convenient theoretical framework for spatial model checking. The closure operator of closure spaces and quasi-discrete closure spaces induces a notion of neighborhood akin to that of topological spaces that build on open sets. For closure models and quasi-discrete closure models, in this paper we present three notions of bisimilarity that are logically characterised by corresponding modal logics with spatial modalities: (i) CM-bisimilarity for closure models (CMs) is shown to generalise topo-bisimilarity for topological models and to be an instantiation of neighbourhood bisimilarity, when CMs are seen as (augmented) neighbourhood models. CM-bisimilarity corresponds to equivalence with respect to the infinitary modal logic IML that includes the modality ${\cal N}$ for ``being near''. (ii) CMC-bisimilarity, with `CMC' standing for CM-bisimilarity with converse, refines CM-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure spaces, carriers of quasi-discrete closure models. Quasi-discrete closure models come equipped with two closure operators, Direct ${\cal C}$ and Converse ${\cal C}$, stemming from the binary relation underlying closure and its converse. CMC-bisimilarity, is captured by the infinitary modal logic IMLC including two modalities, Direct ${\cal N}$ and Converse ${\cal N}$, corresponding to the two closure operators. (iii) CoPa-bisimilarity on quasi-discrete closure models, which is weaker than CMC-bisimilarity, is based on the notion of compatible paths. The logical counterpart of CoPa-bisimilarity is the infinitary modal logic ICRL with modalities Direct $\zeta$ and Converse $\zeta$, whose semantics relies on forward and backward paths, respectively. It is shown that CoPa-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure models relates to divergence-blind stuttering equivalence for Kripke structures.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Formal Proof-Generating Models with ChatGPT and Basic Searching Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of formal proof generation has a rich history, but with modern techniques, we may finally be at the stage of making actual progress in real-life mathematical problems. This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT and basic searching techniques to simplify generating formal proofs, with a particular focus on the miniF2F dataset. We demonstrate how combining a large language model like ChatGPT with a formal language such as Lean, which has the added advantage of being verifiable, enhances the efficiency and accessibility of formal proof generation. Despite its simplicity, our best-performing Lean-based model surpasses all known benchmarks with a 31.15% pass rate. We extend our experiments to include other datasets and employ alternative language models, showcasing our models' comparable performance in diverse settings and allowing for a more nuanced analysis of our results. Our findings offer insights into AI-assisted formal proof generation, suggesting a promising direction for future research in formal mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$.</description>
