      <title>On the limits of agency in agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to understand the behavior of complex systems by simulating a collection of agents that act and interact within an environment. Their practical utility requires capturing realistic environment dynamics and adaptive agent behavior while efficiently simulating million-size populations. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to enhance ABMs by using LLMs as agents with further potential to capture adaptive behavior. However, the computational infeasibility of using LLMs for large populations has hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we introduce AgentTorch -- a framework that scales ABMs to millions of agents while capturing high-resolution agent behavior using LLMs. We benchmark the utility of LLMs as ABM agents, exploring the trade-off between simulation scale and individual agency. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate how AgentTorch can simulate 8.4 million agents representing New York City, capturing the impact of isolation and employment behavior on health and economic outcomes. We compare the performance of different agent architectures based on heuristic and LLM agents in predicting disease waves and unemployment rates. Furthermore, we showcase AgentTorch's capabilities for retrospective, counterfactual, and prospective analyses, highlighting how adaptive agent behavior can help overcome the limitations of historical data in policy design. AgentTorch is an open-source project actively being used for policy-making and scientific discovery around the world. The framework is available here: github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Path Finding in Continuous Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a variant of multi-agent path finding in continuous environment (CE-MAPF), where agents move along sets of smooth curves. Collisions between agents are resolved via avoidance in the space domain. A new Continuous Environment Conflict-Based Search (CE-CBS) algorithm is proposed in this work. CE-CBS combines conflict-based search (CBS) for the high-level search framework with RRT* for low-level path planning. The CE-CBS algorithm is tested under various settings on diverse CE-MAPF instances. Experimental results show that CE-CBS is competitive w.r.t. to other algorithms that consider continuous aspect in MAPF such as MAPF with continuous time.</description>

      <title>On-policy Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Multi-UAV Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly popular in various fields, including precision agriculture, search and rescue, and remote sensing. However, exploring unknown environments remains a significant challenge. This study aims to address this challenge by utilizing on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to explore the {two dimensional} area of interest with multiple UAVs. The UAVs will avoid collision with obstacles and each other and do the exploration in a distributed manner. The proposed solution includes actor-critic networks using deep convolutional neural networks {(CNN)} and long short-term memory (LSTM) for identifying the UAVs and areas that have already been covered. Compared to other RL techniques, such as policy gradient (PG) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PPO approach. Also, the results show that combining LSTM with CNN in critic can improve exploration. Since the proposed exploration has to work in unknown environments, the results showed that the proposed setup can complete the coverage when we have new maps that differ from the trained maps. Finally, we showed how tuning hyper parameters may affect the overall performance.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Encoding Reusable Multi-Robot Planning Strategies as Abstract Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Task Planning (MR-TP) is the search for a discrete-action plan a team of robots should take to complete a task. The complexity of such problems scales exponentially with the number of robots and task complexity, making them challenging for online solution. To accelerate MR-TP over a system's lifetime, this work looks at combining two recent advances: (i) Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH), a novel hypergraph-based framework to efficiently model and solve MR-TP problems; and \mbox{(ii) learning-by-abstraction,} a technique that enables automatic extraction of generalizable planning strategies from individual planning experiences for later reuse. Specifically, we wish to extend this strategy-learning technique, originally designed for single-robot planning, to benefit multi-robot planning using hypergraph-based MR-TP.</description>

      <title>SIFToM: Robust Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language instructions are ubiquitous in agent collaboration. However, in human-robot collaboration, recognition accuracy for human speech is often influenced by various speech and environmental factors, such as background noise, the speaker's accents, and mispronunciation. When faced with noisy or unfamiliar auditory inputs, humans use context and prior knowledge to disambiguate the stimulus and take pragmatic actions, a process referred to as top-down processing in cognitive science. We present a cognitively inspired model, Speech Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions by inferring the human's goal and joint plan as prior for speech perception and understanding. We test SIFToM in simulated home experiments (VirtualHome 2). Results show that the SIFToM model outperforms state-of-the-art speech and language models, approaching human-level accuracy on challenging speech instruction following tasks. We then demonstrate its ability at the task planning level on a mobile manipulator for breakfast preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>CORE-Bench: Fostering the Credibility of Published Research Through a Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents have the potential to aid users on a variety of consequential tasks, including conducting scientific research. To spur the development of useful agents, we need benchmarks that are challenging, but more crucially, directly correspond to real-world tasks of interest. This paper introduces such a benchmark, designed to measure the accuracy of AI agents in tackling a crucial yet surprisingly challenging aspect of scientific research: computational reproducibility. This task, fundamental to the scientific process, involves reproducing the results of a study using the provided code and data. We introduce CORE-Bench (Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 270 tasks based on 90 scientific papers across three disciplines (computer science, social science, and medicine). Tasks in CORE-Bench consist of three difficulty levels and include both language-only and vision-language tasks. We provide an evaluation system to measure the accuracy of agents in a fast and parallelizable way, saving days of evaluation time for each run compared to a sequential implementation. We evaluated two baseline agents: the general-purpose AutoGPT and a task-specific agent called CORE-Agent. We tested both variants using two underlying language models: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best agent achieved an accuracy of 21% on the hardest task, showing the vast scope for improvement in automating routine scientific tasks. Having agents that can reproduce existing work is a necessary step towards building agents that can conduct novel research and could verify and improve the performance of other research agents. We hope that CORE-Bench can improve the state of reproducibility and spur the development of future research agents.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of tools in LLM-based agents overcame the difficulties of standalone LLMs and traditional agents' limited capabilities. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities and overlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. This caused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers which we addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes a clear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional and software architectural perspectives.
  Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework), clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected in previous works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us to classify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, we proposed different multi-core agent architectures combining unique characteristics of various individual agents.
  For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection of state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integrating distinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems. This analysis provided clear insights into potential improvements and highlighted the challenges involved in the combination of specific agents.</description>

      <title>Foragax: An Agent-Based Modelling Framework Based on JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging for resources is a ubiquitous activity conducted by living organisms in a shared environment to maintain their homeostasis. Modelling multi-agent foraging in-silico allows us to study both individual and collective emergent behaviour in a tractable manner. Agent-based modelling has proven to be effective in simulating such tasks, though scaling the simulations to accommodate large numbers of agents with complex dynamics remains challenging. In this work, we present Foragax, a general-purpose, scalable, hardware-accelerated, multi-agent foraging toolkit. Leveraging the JAX library, our toolkit can simulate thousands of agents foraging in a common environment, in an end-to-end vectorized and differentiable manner. The toolkit provides agent-based modelling tools to model various foraging tasks, including options to design custom spatial and temporal agent dynamics, control policies, sensor models, and boundary conditions. Further, the number of agents during such simulations can be increased or decreased based on custom rules. While applied to foraging, the toolkit can also be used to model and simulate a wide range of other multi-agent scenarios.</description>
