      <title>Generalized sums of linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized sums of linear orders. These are binary operations that, given linear orders $A$ and $B$, return an order $A \oplus B$ that can be decomposed as an isomorphic copy of $A$ interleaved with a copy of $B$. We show that there is a rich array of associative sums different from the usual sum $+$ and its dual. The simplest of these sums arise from what we call sum-generating classes of linear orders. These classes determine canonical decompositions of every linear order into left and right halves. We study the structural and algebraic properties of these classes along with the sums they generate.
  We then turn our attention to commutative sums on various subclasses of the linear orders. For this, we introduce the notion of a complicated class of linear orders and show that over such classes sums can be constructed in a very flexible way. Using this construction, we prove the existence of associative sums lacking the structural properties of the usual sum. Along the way, we characterize the associative and commutative sums on the ordinals.</description>

      <title>Hyperdefinability of the Lie model for approximate subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hrushovski proved the Lie model theorem in full generality with model theoretic methods. The theorem states that for every approximate group there exists a generalized definable locally compact model, which, simplifying, is a quasi-homomorphism from the group generated by the approximate subgroup to a locally compact group with some particular properties. Pillay and Krupinski proved the same theorem using topological dynamics on a locally compact type space. In this paper we study the definability of the locally compact group image of the quasihomomorphism in this second proof. We show that it is isomorphic as a topological group to a relatively hyperdefinable locally compact group.</description>

      <title>The theory of implicit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of partial functions of a class of algebras $\mathsf{K}$ is said to be an implicit operation of $\mathsf{K}$ when it is defined by a first order formula and it is preserved by homomorphisms. In this work, we develop the theory of implicit operations from an algebraic standpoint.</description>

      <title>Condensed mathematics through compactological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their 2022 lecture notes on condensed sets, Clausen and Scholze mentioned in a remark that the important subclass of quasiseparated condensed sets is equivalent to the category of so-called compactological spaces defined by Waelbroeck in the 1960s. In this paper we survey the latter category in detail, we give a rigorous proof of Clausen and Scholze's claim, and we establish that condensed sets are a formal categorical completion of Waelbroeck's compactological spaces. The latter answers a question asked by Hanson in 2023 and permits the interpretation of compactological sets as an 'elementary' approach to condensed mathematics.</description>

      <title>Belief in Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel semantics for belief using simplicial complexes. In our framework, belief satisfies the \textsf{KD45} axioms and rules as well as the ``knowledge implies belief'' axiom ($K\phi \lthen B\phi$); in addition, we adopt the (standard) assumption that each facet in our simplicial models has exactly one vertex of every color. No existing model of belief in simplicial complexes that we are aware of is able to satisfy all of these conditions without trivializing belief to coincide with knowledge. We also address the common technical assumption of ``properness'' for relational structures made in the simplicial semantics literature, namely, that no two worlds fall into the same knowledge cell for all agents; we argue that there are conceptually sensible belief frames in which this assumption is violated, and use the result of ``A Note on Proper Relational Structures'' to bypass this restriction. We conclude with a discussion of how an alternative ``simplicial sets'' framework could allow us to bypass properness altogether and perhaps provide a more streamlined simplicial framework for representing belief.</description>

      <title>Domination, fibrations and splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with finite rank stability theory, and more precisely two classical ways to decompose a type using minimal types. The first is its domination equivalence to a Morley power of minimal types, and the second its semi-minimal analysis, both of which are useful in applications. Our main interest is to explore how these two decompositions are connected. We prove that neither determine the other in general, and give more precise connections using various notions from the model theory literature such as uniform internality, proper fibrations and disintegratedness.</description>

      <title>Stationary list colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Komjath studied the list chromatic number of infinite graphs and introduced the notion of restricted list chromatic number. For a graph $X=(V_X,E_X)$ and a cardinal $\kappa$, we say that $X$ is restricted list colorable for $\kappa$ if for every $L:V_X\to[\kappa]^\kappa$ there is a choice function $c$ of $L$ such that $c(v)\neq c(w)$ whenever ${v,w}\in E_X$. In this paper, we discuss a variation, stationary list colorability for $\kappa$, obtained by replacing $[\kappa]^\kappa$ with the set of all stationary subsets of $\kappa$. We compare the stationary list colorability with other coloring properties. Among other things, we prove that the stationary list colorability is essentially different from other coloring properties including the restricted list colorability. We also prove the consistency result showing that for some $\kappa&lt;\lambda$, restricted and stationary list colorability at $\kappa$ do not imply the corresponding properties at $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>Reversible computations are computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>
