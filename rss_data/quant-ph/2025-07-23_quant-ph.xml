      <title>Quantum Complementarity ad Infinitum: Switching Higher-Order Coherence from Infinity to Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a profound manifestation of quantum complementarity in the higher-order photon statistics of the ``Janus state,'' a coherent superposition of two squeezed vacua. We find that the state acts as a perfect quantum switch for multi-photon correlations, toggled by the availability of which-path information. Erasing this information activates quantum interference that can be tuned to be maximally destructive. This reveals a remarkable hierarchy of suppression: while two-photon correlations remain finite, we prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to drive all higher-order correlations ($g^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 3$) to zero. This transition from the extreme bunching of the constituent states ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to a state of profound quantum order is visualized by the emergence of negativity in the state's Wigner function, an unambiguous signature of non-classicality. This work provides a foundational demonstration of quantum complementarity in multi-photon statistics and introduces a new paradigm for engineering highly ordered, non-classical light from Gaussian resources.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Quantum Thermodynamics: Observation-Dependent Quantities, Observation-Independent Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both classical and quantum thermodynamics, physical quantities are typically assigned objective values defined independently of our observations. We then refer to the 'work performed by a gas', or the 'entropy of the gas', regardless of how they are evaluated. Here, we question this conception in the context of quantum thermodynamics, estimating how the definition of pivotal thermodynamic quantities is affected by experimental instruments of limited precision. We find that the coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities frequently lead to different conclusions from those drawn in fine-grained scenarios. For instance, the irreversibility of a process, or its work payoff, can significantly vary with the instrument precision. We show nonetheless that coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities satisfy the same relations (i.e., the second law inequality, the relation between dissipation and distinguishability of a process from its time-reverse, and the quantum work fluctuation theorems) as their fine-grained counterparts. These results highlight the observation-independence of relations linking thermodynamic quantities which are themselves observation-dependent.</description>

      <title>Relaxation control of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in experiments with open quantum systems is to ensure steady-state convergence within a given operational time window. Here, we devise a general state preparation recipe to control relaxation timescales and achieve steady-state convergence within experimental run times. We do so by constructing a unitary operation that cancels the desired relaxation modes. We provide an example in a few-body interacting system (long-range qubit chain), taking into account limitations of experimentally accessible unitary operations in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Topological control of quantum speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure quantifying the sensitivity of a quantum state with respect to changes in tuning parameters in quantum metrology, and defining quantum speed limits. We show that even if the quantum state is completely dispersionless, QFI in this state remains momentum-resolved. We compute the QFI for topological phases at integer filling and demonstrate that each momentum-resolved term is fundamentally bounded by quantum geometric and topological invariants, with maximum QFI controlled by topological invariants (Chern number $|C|$). We also finds bounds on quantum speed limit which scales as $\sqrt{|C|}$ in a (dispersionless) topological phase. We conclude that quantum platforms of high Chern numbers $|C| \gg 1$, such as those featuring twisted multilayered van der Waals heterostructures, significantly enhance capacity for quantum Fisher information, and provide practical control over quantum speed limits.</description>

      <title>Impact of finite squeezing on near-term quantum computations using GKP qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed simulation of a measurement based quantum computation based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits within a quad-rail lattice (QRL) cluster state involving over 100 GKP modes. This was enabled by the recently developed functional matrix product states (FMPS) framework, with which we simulate continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits while explicitly modelling intrinsic coherent error sources due to finite squeezing. We perform simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms classical probability bounds.</description>

      <title>Tunneling driven by quantum light described via field Bohmian trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration. Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian, formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical) real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional graphs convolution for quantum walks photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random walks represent a powerful tool for the implementation of various quantum algorithms. We consider a convolution problem for the graphs which provide quantum and classical random walks. We suggest a new method for lattices and hypercycle convolution that preserves quantum walk dynamics. Our method is based on the fact that some graphs represent a result of Kronecker's product of line graphs. We support our methods by means of various numerical experiments that check quantum and classical random walks on hypercycles and their convolutions. Our findings may be useful for saving a significant number of qubits required for algorithms that use quantum walk simulation on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Towards a pulse-level intermediate representation for diverse quantum control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system-independent intermediate representation (IR) for pulse-level programming of quantum control systems is required to enable rapid development and reuse of quantum software across diverse platforms. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of pulselib as a candidate for such an IR. We implement graph-based IRs and transpilation pipelines for two unique frequency synthesizers and benchmark performance against existing IRs. Key elements of these pipelines are munchers and parametrizable pulse schedules. The former encodes target-specific constraints and allows translation of fundamentally system-agnostic pulse descriptions to arbitrary low-level representations, and the latter enables schedule reuse that produces savings in transpilation time relative to device-specific alternatives. Benchmarks reveal that pulselib provides performance comparable to fast, device-specific IRs while providing a speedup of up to 4.5x over existing IRs. For highly parametrized applications, pulselib provides favorable scaling of transpilation times with respect to the number of parameters and can exhibit speedups relative to existing IRs up to 69% larger than speedups provided by optimized, device-specific techniques.</description>

      <title>Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.</description>

      <title>Schr{\"o}dinger cat state formation in small bosonic Josephson junctions at finite temperatures and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the feasibility of Schr{\"o}dinger cat (SC) and $N00N$ states formation by a convenient bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) system in two-mode approximation. Starting with purely quantum description of two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate we investigate the effective potential approach that provides an accurate analytical description for the system with a large number of particles. We show that in the zero temperature limit SC states result from a quantum phase transition that occurs when the nonlinear strength becomes comparable with the Josephson coupling parameter. The Wigner function approach demonstrates the growth of the SC state halves separation and formation of $N00N$-like states (a Fock state superposition) with the particle number increase. We examine the possibility to attain the SC state at finite temperatures and a weak dissipation leading to appearing of some critical temperature; it defines the second-order phase transition from classical activation process to the SC state formation through the quantum tunneling phenomenon. Numerical estimations demonstrate that the critical temperature is sufficiently below the temperature of atomic condensation. The results obtained may be useful for experimental observation of SC states with small condensate Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Efficient Compilation of Quantum Circuits over Large-Scale Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However, connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Exceptional Points by Interpolating Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special points in non-Hermitian systems where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In open quantum systems, these points are typically analyzed using effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or Liouvillian superoperators. While quantum channels offer the most general framework for describing state evolution in such systems, the existence and properties of EPs within this setting remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general strategy for generating quantum EPs for a single-qubit setting. We show that quantum channels can be separated into two distinct phases, with the transition between them marked by the presence of an EP. Based on this, we propose a systematic method to realize EPs by interpolating between quantum channels representing different phases. Experimentally, we implement these interpolated channels on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer and confirm the emergence of second-order EPs with high fidelity. Extending the interpolation to three channels further reveals third-order EPs. Our results establish quantum channel interpolation as a versatile framework for generating EPs and provide a general description of EPs in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Recovery of Niobium-based Superconducting Resonators after Laser Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing superconducting microwave resonators with optical systems enables sensitive photon detectors, quantum transducers, and related quantum technologies. Achieving high optical pulse repetition is crucial for maximizing the device throughput. However, light-induced deterioration, such as quasiparticle poisoning, pair-breaking-phonon generation, and elevated temperature, hinders the rapid recovery of superconducting circuits, limiting their ability to sustain high optical pulse repetition rates. Understanding these loss mechanisms and enabling fast circuit recovery are therefore critical. In this work, we investigate the impact of optical illumination on niobium nitride and niobium microwave resonators by immersing them in superfluid helium-4 and demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude faster resonance recovery compared to vacuum. By analyzing transient resonance responses, we provide insights into light-induced dynamics in these superconductors, highlighting the advantages of niobium-based superconductors and superfluid helium for rapid circuit recovery in superconducting quantum systems integrated with optical fields.</description>

Abstract: This short note shows that the recently proposed generating function for loop hafnians -- originally derived using quantum-optical methods for a restricted class of matrices -- is in fact valid for arbitrary symmetric matrices. The proof relies solely on Gaussian integration and does not assume any additional properties inherited from the covariance matrices of quantum Gaussian states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the 1927 thought experiment of Einstein on electron diffraction, using a single-electron source and an opaque hemispheric detector array, now achievable with modern sensors. In this fully enclosed system, where no signals escape the hemisphere, we provide a direct empirical comparison of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI). Both maintain unitarity without invoking wavefunction collapse, as in the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), but differ ontologically: MWI proposes irreversible global branching into parallel worlds, while BHSI describes local, potentially reversible branching into decohered subspaces. In this setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and relocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule, naturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector statistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an enhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector. Because the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average response times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of measurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted choices. Our analysis challenges the notion that unitarity necessitates parallel worlds, instead advocating for a simpler view: local, unitary branching without collapse or global splitting.</description>

      <title>Optimal schedule of multi-channel quantum Zeno dragging with application to solving the k-SAT problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Zeno dragging enables the preparation of common eigenstates of a set of observables by frequent measurement and adiabatic-like modulation of the measurement basis. In this work, we present a deeper analysis of multi-channel Zeno dragging using generalized measurements, i.e. simultaneously measuring a set of non-commuting observables that vary slowly in time, to drag the state towards a target subspace. For concreteness, we will focus on a measurement-driven approach to solving k-SAT problems as examples. We first compute some analytical upper bounds on the convergence time, including the effect of finite measurement time resolution. We then apply optimal control theory to obtain the optimal dragging schedule that lower bounds the convergence time, for low-dimensional settings. This study provides a theoretical foundation for multi-channel Zeno dragging and its optimization, and also serves as a guide for designing optimal dragging schedules for quantum information tasks including measurement-driven quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Practical blueprint for low-depth photonic quantum computing with quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computing is an attractive model for fault-tolerant computation based on photonics requiring only finite-sized entangled resource states followed by linear-optics operations and photon measurements. Large-scale implementations have so far been limited due to the access only to probabilistic photon sources, vulnerability to photon loss, and the need for massive multiplexing. Deterministic photon sources offer an alternative and resource-efficient route. By synergistically integrating deterministic photon emission, adaptive repeat-until-success fusions, and an optimised architectural design, we propose a complete blueprint for a photonic quantum computer using quantum dots and linear optics. It features time-bin qubit encoding, reconfigurable entangled-photon sources, and a fusion-based architecture with low optical connectivity, significantly reducing the required optical depth per photon and resource overheads. We present in detail the hardware required for resource-state generation and fusion networking, experimental pulse sequences, and exact resource estimates for preparing a logical qubit. We estimate that one logical clock cycle of error correction can be executed within microseconds, which scales linearly with the code distance. We also simulate error thresholds for fault-tolerance by accounting for a full catalogue of intrinsic error sources found in real-world quantum dot devices. Our work establishes a practical blueprint for a low-optical-depth, emitter-based fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Pulse-Level Simulation of Crosstalk Attacks on Superconducting Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame, capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust. Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.</description>

      <title>Statistical Assertions for Debugging Quantum Circuits and States in CUDA-Q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing continues to mature, more developers are designing, coding, and simulating quantum circuits. A challenge exists, however, in debugging quantum circuits, particularly as they scale in size and complexity. Given the lack of effective debugging workflows, developers are forced to manually inspect their circuits and analyze various quantum states, which is error-prone and time-consuming.
  In this research, we present a statistical assertion-based debugging workflow for CUDA-Q. CUDA-Q has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage GPUs to accelerate quantum circuit simulations; this allows circuits to scale to larger depths and widths, where they can be particularly hard to debug by hand. Inspired by and building from prior Qiskit-based debuggers, our work allows CUDA-Q users to verify quantum program correctness with greater ease. Through the insertion of statistical assertions within a quantum circuit, our tool provides valuable insights into the state of qubits at any point within a circuit, tracks their evolution, and helps detect deviations from expected behavior. Furthermore, we improve the reliability and accuracy of the product state assertion by using a combination of Fisher's exact test and the Monte Carlo Method instead of a chi-square test, and examine the impact of CUDA-Q's distinct kernel-based programming model on the design of our debugging tool. This work offers a practical solution to one of CUDA-Q's usability gaps, paving the way for more reliable and efficient quantum software development.</description>

      <title>Engineering Non-Hermitian Quantum Evolution Using a Hermitian Bath Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling, state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High temperature superradiant phase transition in novel quantum structures with complex network interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we propose a novel quantum material concept, which enables super- and/or ultrastrong interaction of two-level systems with the photonic field in a complex network. Within the mean field approximation we examine phase transition to superradiance that results in two excitation (polariton) branches and is accompanied by the appearance of non-zero macroscopic polarization of two-level systems. We characterize the statistical properties of networks by the first, ${\langle}k{\rangle}$, and second normalized, $\zeta\equiv{\langle}k^2{\rangle}/{\langle}k{\rangle}$, moments for node degree distribution. We have shown that the Rabi frequency is essentially enhanced due to the topology of the network within the anomalous domain where ${\langle}k{\rangle}$ and $\zeta$ sufficiently grow. The multichannel (multimode) structure of matter-field interaction leads superstrong coupling that provides primary behavior of the high temperature phase transition. The results obtained pave the way to design new photonic and polaritonic circuits, quantum networks for efficient processing quantum information at high (room) temperatures.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of Gibbs states for many-body Hamiltonians with applications to Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.</description>

      <title>On the Differential Topology of Expressivity of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits play a key role in quantum computing. Measuring the suitability of such a circuit for solving a class of problems is needed. One such promising measure is the expressivity of a circuit, which is defined in two main variants. The variant in focus of this contribution is the so-called dimensional expressivity which measures the dimension of the submanifold of states produced by the circuit. Understanding this measure needs a lot of background from differential topology which makes it hard to comprehend. In this article we provide this background in a vivid as well as pedagogical manner. Especially it strives towards being self-contained for understanding expressivity, e.g. the required mathematical foundations are provided and examples are given. Also, the literature makes several statements about expressivity the proofs of which are omitted or only indicated. In this article we give proofs for key statements from dimensional expressivity, sometimes revealing limits for generalizing them, and also sketching how to proceed in practice to determine this measure.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Order Phase Transition in Continuous-Variable Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) have been predominantly driven by discrete-variable (DV) architectures. Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian states--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based QNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation and communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV entanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a Gaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically transports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis of the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a new form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory (NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio negativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition, marked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a long-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based QNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems. Additionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical vulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes inherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for stabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical models for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously unexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights and guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases, although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably, fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential analysis of the capabilities of quantum computing, especially before fault tolerance at scale, is difficult due to the variety of existing hardware technologies with a wide spread of maturity. Not only the result of computations, but also the very process of running quantum-enhanced algorithms differ from provider to provider. The study includes a comparative analysis of various hardware architectures with the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a central class of combinatorial optimization. It highlights what steps are necessary to run real-world applications on quantum hardware, showcases how the providers and various technologies differ and presents results in the relative efficiency of exemplary quantum algorithms on neutral atom-based, ion trap and superconducting hardware, the latter including both gate-based and annealing devices. This is an important step in advancing the understanding of quantum computing capabilities from an application standpoint - agnostic to the underlying qubit technology and projecting results into the future to judge what further developments on the application side are necessary.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two-dimensional tensor network representations of finite groups carrying a 4-cocycle index. We characterize the associated gapped (2+1)D phases that emerge when these anomalous symmetries act on tensor network ground states. We further develop related tensor network unitaries that generate symmetric states representing (3+1)D symmetry protected topological phases. Although aspects of these constructions have been previously addressed, our contribution unifies them within a single tensor network framework and emphasizes the explicit formulation of local tensor equations encoding global consistency conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum state tomography with auxiliary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a technique in quantum information science used to reconstruct the density matrix of an unknown quantum state, providing complete information about the quantum state. It is of significant importance in fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum simulation. However, as the size of the quantum system increases, the number of measurement settings and sampling requirements for quantum state tomography grow exponentially with the number of qubits. This not only makes experimental design and implementation more complex, but also exacerbates the consumption of experimental resources. These limitations severely hinder the application of state tomography in large-scale quantum systems. To reduce measurement settings and improve sampling efficiency, this study proposes a state tomography method based on auxiliary systems. This method can be implemented through either entanglement between the quantum system to be measured and a quantum auxiliary system or through correlation between the quantum system and a probabilistic classical auxiliary system. Measurements on the entire joint system enable more efficient extraction of information about the quantum state to be measured. This method relies on standard quantum gate operations and requires only two measurement settings, with a total sampling complexity of $O(d^2)$, significantly simplifying experimental operations and measurement processes. Additionally, this study provides two schemes for measuring purity based on the proposed circuit, one of which achieves measurement precision at the Heisenberg limit. This study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method through a detailed theoretical analysis, a series of numerical simulations, and experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dark Magic: Efficiency of Intermediate Non-Stabiliserness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While superiority of quantum over classical computation has been established, the repertoire of primitives with proven or conjectured quantum advantage remains limited. Despite considerable progress in delineating the quantumclassical divide, the systematic construction of algorithms with quantum advantage remains challenging, which can be attributed to a still incomplete understanding of the sources of quantum computational power. While intermediate non-stabiliserness (i.e., traversal of states outside the Clifford orbit) indicates necessary non-classical behaviour for quantum advantage, naively equating non-stabiliserness and non-classicality is misguided: Even random Haar sampled states exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness. Advancing towards quantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of non-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of non-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of non-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and introduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal non-stabiliser effects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations. We find different efficiency in the use of non-stabiliserness for structured and unstructured variational approaches, and show that greater freedom for classical optimisation in quantum-classical methods increases unnecessary non-stabiliser consumption. Our results open new means of analysing the efficient utilisation of quantum resources, and contribute towards the targeted construction of algorithmic quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable, low-error dynamic polarization encoding of deterministically generated single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations. Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of 0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing with single photon sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations in the vacuum can be formally cast in the form of Schr\"odinger's equation. Unfortunately, the vector to which this equation directly applies is not a wavefunction: its amplitude squared is not a probability density but the expected energy density of the field. Since we can count photons, there must be a more convincing wavefunction, derived from the EM field, whose amplitude squared is an expected photon density. Mandel proposed the second quantized version of such a wavefunction, but did not link it directly to the EM field. We show how this can be accomplished.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Rydberg gates between distant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient protocol to realize multi-qubit gates in arrays of neutral atoms. The atoms encode qubits in the long-lived hyperfine sublevels of the ground electronic state. To realize the gate, we apply a global laser pulse to transfer the atoms to a Rydberg state with strong blockade interaction that suppresses simultaneous excitation of neighboring atoms arranged in a star-graph configuration. The number of Rydberg excitations, and thereby the parity of the resulting state, depends on the multiqubit input state. Upon changing the sign of the interaction and de-exciting the atoms with an identical laser pulse, the system acquires a geometric phase that depends only on the parity of the excited state, while the dynamical phase is completely canceled. Using single qubit rotations, this transformation can be converted to the C$_k$Z or C$_k$NOT quantum gate for $k+1$ atoms. We also present extensions of the scheme to implement quantum gates between distant atomic qubits connected by a quantum bus consisting of a chain of atoms.</description>

      <title>Isocoherent Work Extraction from Quantum Batteries: Basis-Dependent Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a connection between quantum coherence and the maximum extractable work from a quantum battery, and to this end, we define the coherence-constrained maximal work (CCMW) as the highest amount of work extractable via coherence-preserving unitaries, optimized over all quantum states with fixed coherence in a given dimension. For qubit systems, we derive an analytical relation between the CCMW and the input coherence, defined with respect to an arbitrary fixed basis. Strikingly, we find that for fixed quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the maximal extractable work decreases with increase of coherence. In contrast, when quantum coherence is with respect to a basis for which the Hamiltonian possesses off-diagonal elements, and has equal diagonal elements, the CCMW increases with the level of quantum coherence. We numerically observe that the basis-dependent response of the CCMW also persists in higher-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we show that even in higher dimensions one can derive closed-form relations between the CCMW and the input quantum coherence within certain numerically-assessed conclusions. We also comment on the structure of passive states in an isocoherent scenario, that is, states from which no energy can be extracted under coherence-preserving unitaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal operations are quantum channels that have taken a prominent role in deriving fundamental thermodynamic limitations in quantum systems. We show that these channels are uniquely characterized by a purely quantum information theoretic property: They admit a dilation into a unitary process that leaves the environment invariant when applied to the equilibrium state. In other words, they are the only channels that preserve equilibrium between system and environment. Extending this perspective, we explore an information theoretic idealization of heat bath behavior, by considering channels where the environment remains locally invariant for every initial state of the system. These are known as catalytic channels. We show that catalytic channels provide a refined hierarchy of Gibbs-preserving maps for fully-degenerate Hamiltonians, and are closely related to dual unitary quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Studies of properties of bipartite graphs with quantum programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-qubit quantum states corresponding to bipartite graphs $G(U,V,E)$ are examined. These states are constructed by applying $CNOT$ gates to an arbitrary separable multi-qubit quantum state. The entanglement distance of the resulting states is derived analytically for an arbitrary bipartite graph structure. A relationship between entanglement and the vertex degree is established. Additionally, we identify how quantum correlators relate to the number of vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. Based on these results, quantum protocols are proposed for quantifying the number of vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. For a specific case where the bipartite graph is a star graph, we analytically calculate the dependence of entanglement distance on the state parameters. These results are also verified through quantum simulations on the AerSimulator, including noise models. Furthermore, we use quantum calculations to quantify the number of vertices with odd degrees in $U$ and $V$. The results agree with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable qubit states and quantum trajectories in a synthetic artificial neuron network with a process to direct information generation from co-integrated burst-mode spiking under non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A synthetic artificial neuron network functional in a regime where quantum information processes are co-integrated with spiking computation provides significant improvement in the capabilities of neuromorphic systems in performing artificial intelligence and autonomy tasks. This provides the ability to execute with the qubit coherence states and entanglement as well as in tandem to perform functions such as read out and basic arithmetic with conventional spike-encoding. Ultimately, this enables the generation and computational processing of information packets with advanced capabilities and an increased level of security in their routing. We now use the dynamical pulse sequences generated by a memristive spiking neuron to drive synthetic neurons with built-in superconductor-ionic memories built in a lateral layout with integrated Niobium metal electrodes as well as a gate terminal and an atomic layer deposited ionic barrier. The memories operate at very low voltage and with direct, and hysteretic Josephson tunneling and provide enhanced coherent properties enabling qubit behavior. We operated now specifically in burst mode to drive its built-in reconfigurable qubit states and direct the resulting quantum trajectory. We analyze the new system with a Hamiltonian that considers an integrated rotational dependence, dependent on the unique co-integrated bursting mode spiking- and where the total above threshold spike count is adjustable with variation of the level of coupling between the neurons. We then examined the impact of key parameters with a longer-term non-Markovian quantum memory and finally explored a process and algorithm for the generation of information packets with a coupled and entangled set of these artificial neuron qubits that provides for a quantum process to define the level of regularity or awareness of the information packets.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional perfect absorption induced by chiral coupling in spin-momentum locked waveguide magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy harvesting technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that approximating the trace norm contraction coefficient of a quantum channel within a constant factor is NP-hard. Equivalently, this shows that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical analogue of this problem that can clearly by solved efficiently. Our hardness results also hold for deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1. As a consequence, we show that deciding if a non-commutative graph has an independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the contraction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Parametric Amplification of Spin-Motion Coupling in Three-Dimensional Trapped-Ion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) crystals offer a route to scale up trapped ion systems for quantum sensing and quantum simulation applications. However, engineering coherent spin-motion couplings and effective spin-spin interactions in large crystals poses technical challenges associated with decoherence and prolonged timescales to generate appreciable entanglement. Here, we explore the possibility to speed up these interactions in 3D crystals via parametric amplification. We derive a general Hamiltonian for the parametric amplification of spin-motion coupling that is applicable to crystals of any dimension in both rf Paul traps and Penning traps. Unlike in lower dimensional crystals, we find that the ability to faithfully (uniformly) amplify the spin-spin interactions in 3D crystals depends on the physical implementation of the spin-motion coupling. We consider the light-shift (LS) gate, and the so-called phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gates, and find that only the latter gate can be faithfully amplified in general 3D crystals. We discuss a situation where non-uniform amplification can be advantageous. We also reconsider the impact of counter-rotating terms on parametric amplification and find that they are not as detrimental as previous studies suggest.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter estimation with position-momentum correlated Gaussian probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under which the derived bounds can be saturated.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation of an elemental silicon nanophotonic CNOT gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform, high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components, post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits. First, we measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +- 0.3%. Second, for different input polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +- 2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +- 0.8%. Fourthly, we fully characterize our teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity 83.1 +- 2.0%, and an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +- 2.2%. Our teleported photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Broadband Relaxation Dynamics of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride ($\mathrm{hBN}$) has attracted attention for its potential applications in quantum sensing. While GHz-scale sensing at low magnetic fields has been demonstrated with these defects, their behavior at high fields remains largely unexplored. We investigate the spin relaxation dynamics of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers over temperatures of $15-250$ K and magnetic fields of up to $7$ T, corresponding to a ground-state splitting of $\sim 200$ GHz. Our results uncover distinct relaxation regimes, transitioning from spin-spin-interaction-driven and disorder-induced stretched exponential dynamics at low temperatures and fields to relaxation dominated by single-phonon processes at elevated magnetic fields. We extract temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviors of the relaxation rate to provide a quantitative picture of the interactions between $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers and their environment. Our results pave the way towards high-field, sub-terahertz quantum sensors based on two-dimensional spin-defect platforms.</description>

      <title>No-go theorems for logical gates on product quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are essential to the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Homological products of classical codes offer a versatile framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties, especially quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes. Based on extensions of the Bravyi--K\"{o}nig theorem that encompass codes without geometric locality, we establish a series of general no-go theorems for fault-tolerant logical gates supported by hypergraph product codes. Specifically, we show that non-Clifford logical gates cannot be implemented transversally on hypergraph product codes of all product dimensions, and that the dimensions impose various limitations on the accessible level of the Clifford hierarchy gates by constant-depth local circuits. We also discuss examples both with and without geometric locality which attain the Clifford hierarchy bounds. Our results reveal fundamental restrictions on logical gates originating from highly general algebraic structures, extending beyond existing knowledge only in geometrically local, finite logical qubits, transversal, or 2-dimensional product cases, and may guide the vital study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with qLDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Convergent perturbative series via finite path integral limits: application to energy at strong coupling of the anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving quantum field theories at strong coupling remains a challenging task. The main issue is that the usual perturbative series are asymptotic series which can be useful at weak coupling but break down completely at strong coupling. In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path integral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely convergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this perturbative approach to $\lambda \,\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic integral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic integral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose values are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This worked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known that the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy of the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at strong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it is often easier to use Schr\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative series than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to placing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is positive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion for the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic oscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series to calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling. At strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct) energy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong coupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Colliders are Testing neither Locality via Bell's Inequality nor Entanglement versus Non-Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently there has been an increased interest in possible tests of locality via Bell's inequality or tests of entanglement at colliders, in particular at the LHC. These have involved various physical processes, such as $t \bar t$, or $\tau^+\tau^-$ production, or the decay of a Higgs boson to 2 vector bosons $H\to VV^*$. We argue that \textit{none} of these proposals constitute a test of locality via Bell's inequality or a test of quantum entanglement versus non-entanglement. In all cases what is measured are the momenta of the final state particles. Using the construction proposed by Kasday (1971) in a different context, and adapted to collider scenarios by Abel, Dittmar, and Dreiner (1992), it is straightforward to construct a local hidden variable theory (LHVT) which exactly reproduces the data. This construction is only possible as the final state momenta all commute. This LHVT satisfies Bell's inequality and is by construction \textit{not} entangled. Thus a test of locality via Bell's inequality or a test of entanglement versus non-entanglement is inherently \textit{not} possible.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a phase transition in a KTaO$_3$ crystal, corresponding to a paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition. The crystal was placed inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and the transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the frequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes decreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies converge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point, reverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing temperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric permittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we conducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\sim$ 7\%) of niobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition is driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an otherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($&lt;$ 2\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this temperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of tunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where low-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on quantum entanglement and coherence in curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of the Lande g-factors for the 5d6s $^3$D$_2$ hyperfine levels of $^{176}$Lu$^+$ to a fractional inaccuracy of $5\times 10^{-7}$. Combining these measurements with theoretical calculations allows us to estimate hyperfine-mediated modifications to the quadrupole moments for each state and infer a value of $\delta\Theta = 1.59(34)\times 10^{-4} \,ea_0^2$ for the residual quadrupole moment of the $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{^3}D_2$ hyperfine-averaged clock transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of a large set of ferromagnetic scarred states in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions, in a regime with no ferromagnetic phase at finite temperature. These scarred states are distributed over different spectral regions, surrounded by paramagnetic states. We show that simple initial conditions, consisting in a few small magnetic domains, selectively populate these scarred states. This leads to the appearance of a special dynamical phase, which we call scarred ferromagnetic phase. As a consequence, initial states with a small number of small magnetic domains evolve towards ferromagnetic equilibrium states, whereas initial states with larger domains or no magnetic structure relax to the expected thermal paramagnetic equilibrium state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Revisiting boundary-driven method for transport: Finite-size effects and the role of system-bath coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding transport in interacting quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Numerical studies typically rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and Markovian dynamics governed by master equations for boundary-driven open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of methods remains an open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ computed from the aforementioned two approaches. We find a clear mismatch between the two, with $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath coupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental limitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related to asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this mismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \rightarrow \infty$ and system size $L\rightarrow \infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to boundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only time-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework, which show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism based on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This leads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the system-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>A charge-density machine-learning workflow for computing the infrared spectrum of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

Abstract: Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission, beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials, bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study some special classes of ladder operators in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular we consider a truncated version of quons, their {\em psudo-}version, and a third family of operators acting on a closed chain. In this latter situation, we discuss the existence of what could be considered {\em discrete coherent states}, as suitable eigenvectors of the annihilation operator of the chain. We see that, under reasonable assumptions, a resolution of the identity can be recovered, involving these states, together with a biorthogonal family of vectors, which turn out to be eigenstates of the raising operator of the chain.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics in a rotating BTZ black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector outside a BTZ black hole, from a perspective of quantum thermodynamics. In the context of an open quantum system, we derive the complete dynamics of the detector, which encodes a complicated response to scalar background fields. Using various information theory tools, such as quantum relative entropy, quantum heat, coherence, quantum Fisher information, and quantum speed of evolution, we examined three quantum thermodynamic laws for the UDW detector, where the influences from BTZ angular momentum and Hawking radiation are investigated. In particular, based on information geometry theory, we find an intrinsic asymmetry in the detector's thermolization process as it undergoes Hawking radiation from the BTZ black hole. In particular, we find that the detector consistently heats faster than it cools, analogous to the quantum Mpemba effect for nonequilibrium systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spin of a black hole significantly influences the magnitude of the asymmetry, while preserving the dominance of heating over cooling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limits Based on Schatten Norms: Universality and Tightness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using Schatten $\alpha$-norms, firstly exploiting geometric features of the quantum state space, and secondly by applying the Holder's inequality for matrix norms. For single-qubit states, we find that the geometric QSL is independent of the chosen Schatten norm, thus revealing universality behavior. We compare these QSLs with existing speed limits in literature, showing that the latter results represent particular cases of a general class of QSLs related to Schatten $\alpha$-norms. We address necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the QSLs that depends on populations and coherences of the qubits, also addressing their geometric meaning. We compare the QSLs obtained for qubit dynamics, also exploring their geometrical meaning. Finally, we show that the geometric QSL is tighter for general qubit dynamics with initial pure states, which indicates a universal QSL.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Nuclear Effective Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources to realize this potential, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. Within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. For the latter, we consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. Within these models, we examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. We find that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate, followed by the one-pion-exchange theory, then the dynamical-pion theory. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. In the process, we develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic number-preserving Hamiltonians, and obtain tighter Trotter error bounds by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. Compared to previous estimates for the pionless EFT, our results represent an improvement by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Fields Are Universal Entanglement Embezzlers</title>

Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Joint Measurement Strategy for Estimating Fermionic Observables and Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians relevant in quantum chemistry and correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is based on implementing a measurement that jointly measures noisy versions of any product of two or four Majorana operators in an $N$ mode fermionic system. To realize our measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries that realize products of Majorana fermion operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable post-processing. Our scheme can estimate expectation values of all quadratic and quartic Majorana monomials to $\epsilon$ precision using $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ measurement rounds respectively, matching the performance offered by fermionic classical shadows. In certain settings, such as a rectangular lattice of qubits which encode an $N$ mode fermionic system via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme can be implemented in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ with $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ two-qubit gates, offering an improvement over fermionic and matchgate classical shadows that require depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ two-qubit gates. By benchmarking our method on exemplary molecular Hamiltonians and observing performances comparable to fermionic classical shadows, we demonstrate a novel, competitive alternative to existing strategies.</description>

      <title>Beating the natural Grover bound for low-energy estimation and state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating ground state energies of many-body Hamiltonians is a central task in many areas of quantum physics. In this work, we give quantum algorithms which, given any $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$, compute an estimate for the ground state energy and prepare a quantum state achieving said energy, respectively. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of $H$ within additive error $\varepsilon M$, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, $M$ is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the runtime of our algorithms scales as $2^{cn/2}$ for $c&lt;1$, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking a standard square root Grover speedup for unstructured search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that an extensive fraction of the interactions can be neglected with a controlled error. What this ultimately implies is that even arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonians have structure in their low energy space, in the form of an exponential-dimensional low energy subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fulfilled. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses and manifests their potential for the construction of two-qubit gates. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

Abstract: The practical implementation of quantum optimization algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices requires accounting for their limited connectivity. As such, the Parity architecture was introduced to overcome this limitation by encoding binary optimization problems onto planar quantum chips. We investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on the Parity architecture (Parity QAOA) for solving instances of the signed Max-Cut problem on complete and regular graphs. By comparing the algorithms at fixed circuit depth, we demonstrate that Parity QAOA outperforms conventional QAOA implementations based on SWAP networks. Our analysis utilizes Clifford circuits to estimate lower performance bounds for Parity QAOA for problem sizes that would be otherwise inaccessible on classical computers. For single layer circuits we additionally benchmark the recursive variant of the two algorithms, showing that their performance is equal.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Pseudorandomness from Hamiltonian Phase States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum pseudorandomness has found applications in many areas of quantum information, ranging from entanglement theory, to models of scrambling phenomena in chaotic quantum systems, and, more recently, in the foundations of quantum cryptography. Kretschmer (TQC '21) showed that both pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries exist even in a world without classical one-way functions. To this day, however, all known constructions require classical cryptographic building blocks which are themselves synonymous with the existence of one-way functions, and which are also challenging to realize on realistic quantum hardware.
  In this work, we seek to make progress on both of these fronts simultaneously -- by decoupling quantum pseudorandomness from classical cryptography altogether. We introduce a quantum hardness assumption called the Hamiltonian Phase State (HPS) problem, which is the task of decoding output states of a random instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuit. Hamiltonian phase states can be generated very efficiently using only Hadamard gates, single-qubit Z-rotations and CNOT circuits. We show that the hardness of our problem reduces to a worst-case version of the problem, and we provide evidence that our assumption is plausibly fully quantum; meaning, it cannot be used to construct one-way functions. We also show information-theoretic hardness when only few copies of HPS are available by proving an approximate $t$-design property of our ensemble. Finally, we show that our HPS assumption and its variants allow us to efficiently construct many pseudorandom quantum primitives, ranging from pseudorandom states, to quantum pseudoentanglement, to pseudorandom unitaries, and even primitives such as public-key encryption with quantum keys.</description>

      <title>Quantum surface effects on quantum emitters coupled to surface plasmon polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an ideal platform for exploring strong quantized light-matter interactions, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has inspired many applications in quantum technologies. Recent experiments discovered that quantum surface effects (QSEs) of the metal, including nonlocal optical response, electron spill-out, and Landau damping, invalidate the classical electromagnetic theory and contribute additional loss sources to the SPP in the nanoscale. This hinders its applications. Going beyond the widely used classical local response approximation, we use the Feibelman $d$-parameter method to investigate the QSE-modified non-Markovian dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to a SPP in a planar metal-dielectric nanostructure. A mechanism to overcome the dissipation of the QEs caused by the lossy SPP with the QSEs is discovered. We find that, as long as the QE-SPP bound states are formed, a dissipationless entanglement among the far-separated QEs is created. Compared with the local-response approximate results, the QSEs play a constructive role in establishing such a coherent correlation. The result lays a foundation for understanding the light-matter interactions in absorptive media and paves the way for the application of SPP in quantum network.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Mpemba Effect with Squeezed Thermal Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon where a quantum system can be exponentially accelerated to its stationary state has been referred to as the Quantum Mpemba Effect (QMpE). Due to its analogy with the classical Mpemba effect, hot water freezes faster than cold water, this phenomenon has garnered significant attention. Although QMpE has been characterized and experimentally verified in different scenarios, the sufficient and necessary conditions to achieve such a phenomenon are still under investigation. In this paper, we address a sufficient condition for QMpE through a general approach for open quantum system dynamics. With the help of the Mpemba parameter introduced in this work to quantify how strong the QMpE can be, we discuss how our conditions can predict and explain the emergence of weak and strong QMpE in a robust way. As an application, by harnessing the intrinsic non-classical nature of squeezed thermal environments, we show how enhanced QMpE can be effectively induced when our conditions are met. We demonstrate that when the system interacts with thermal reservoirs, a hot qubit freezes faster than a cold qubit in the presence of squeezing. Our results provide tools and new insights, opening a broad avenue for further investigation at the most fundamental levels of this peculiar phenomenon in the quantum realm.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Dynamical Codes for Biased Noise: The X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet code, a dynamical code with improved performance under biased noise compared to other Floquet codes. The enhanced performance is attributed to a simplified decoding problem resulting from a persistent stabiliser-product symmetry, which surprisingly exists in a code without constant stabilisers. Even if such a symmetry is allowed, we prove that general dynamical codes with two-qubit parity measurements cannot admit one-dimensional decoding graphs, a key feature responsible for the high performance of bias-tailored stabiliser codes. Despite this, our comprehensive simulations show that the symmetry of the X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet code renders its performance under biased noise far better than several leading Floquet codes. To maintain high-performance implementation in hardware without native two-qubit parity measurements, we introduce ancilla-assisted bias-preserving parity measurement circuits. Our work establishes the X$^3$Z$^3$ code as a prime quantum error-correcting code, particularly for devices with reduced connectivity, such as the honeycomb and heavy-hexagonal architectures.</description>

Abstract: Introducing flexible native entanglement gates can significantly reduce circuit complexity. We propose a novel gate integrating iswap and cphase operations within a single gate cycle. We theoretically show one possible realization of this gate for superconducting qubits using bichromatic parametric drives at distinct frequencies. We show how various parameters, such as drive amplitudes and frequencies, can control entanglement parameters. This approach enhances gate versatility, opening pathways for more efficient quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Long-distance cascaded fluorescence of cold Cesium atoms coupled to an optical nanofiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first experimental realization of cascaded resonance fluorescence over a 64-meter propagation delay time between two spatially and temporally independent ensembles of laser-cooled Cesium atoms coupled to an optical nanofiber. Spontaneously emitted photons from a strongly driven first ensemble are guided through a standard fiber, reflected by a fiber Bragg grating mirror, and interact with a second ensemble, producing a unidirectional two-node cascaded system. The cascaded fluorescence spectrum is broadened and blue-shifted relative to the original fluorescence spectrum. Our simple model reproduces the power broadening and the cascaded fluorescence spectrum, as well as the ratio of cascaded to original photon flux, giving insight into non-Markovian dynamics. Our results establish the longest-distance one-way cascaded atom-photon interface reported to date, providing a stepping stone towards a fiber-based platform for quantum networking.</description>

      <title>From dynamical to steady-state many-body metrology: Precision limits and their attainability with two-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body time-independent interactions enhance its $\theta$-sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the Quantum Fisher Information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding~$\theta$: (i)~via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii)~in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (time-averaged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a foundational application for quantum computers, projected to offer insights into complex quantum systems beyond the reach of classical computation. However, with the exception of Trotter-based methods, which suffer from suboptimal scaling with respect to simulation precision, existing simulation techniques are, for the most part, too intricate to implement on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. We propose a quantum Hamiltonian dynamics simulation algorithm that aims to be both straightforward to implement and, at the same time, have near-optimal scaling in simulation precision.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Mass Dependence in Spontaneous Collapse Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models aim to solve the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics by modifying the theory's dynamics to include objective wave function collapses. These collapses occur randomly in space, bridging the gap between quantum and classical behavior. A central feature of these models is their dependence on mass density, which directly influences how and when collapse events occur. In this work, we explore a generalized framework in which the collapse dynamics depend on arbitrary functions of the mass density, extending previous models. We analyze the theoretical consistency of these generalizations, investigate their predictions, and compare them with experimental data. Our findings show that only a limited range of mass-dependence functions are viable, with significant implications for the future development and empirical testability of collapse-based models. Importantly, they also indicate that a well-justified model denoted here as PSL shows much more resilience to experimental falsification than standard collapse models.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems</title>

Abstract: Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Quantum Neutral-Atom-Assisted Benders Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents key enhancements to our previous work~\cite{naghmouchi2024mixed} on a hybrid Benders decomposition (HBD) framework for solving mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). In our approach, the master problem is reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and solved on a neutral-atom quantum processor using automated conversion techniques. Our enhancements address three critical challenges. First, to adapt to hardware constraints, we refine the QUBO formulation by tightening the bounds of continuous variables and employing an exponential encoding method that eliminates slack variables, thereby reducing the required qubit count. Second, to improve solution quality, we propose a robust feasibility cut generation method inspired by the L-shaped approach and implement a constructive penalty tuning mechanism that replaces manual settings. Third, to accelerate convergence, we introduce a multi-cut strategy that integrates multiple high-density Benders cuts per iteration. Extensive numerical results demonstrate significant improvements compared to our previous approach: the feasibility rate increases from 68 percent to 100 percent, and the optimality rate rises from 52 percent to 86 percent . These advancements provide a solid foundation for future hybrid quantum-classical optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>Weak-coupling bound states in semi-infinite topological waveguide QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</description>

Abstract: We design the information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer in a fine-grained or coarse-grained model, where information is carried by classical bits. This architecture enables both a Hamiltonian process converting a given input pure state to another output pure state of the system to be considered (functionality) and a physical process to acquire information (subjectivity). The latter process is identified with the projection hypothesis in projective quantum measurement in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>

Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Clocking and controlling attosecond currents in a scanning tunnelling microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tunnelling of electrons can be confined to the sub-cycle time scale of strong light fields, contributing decisively to the extreme time resolution of attosecond science. Because tunnelling also enables atomic-scale spatial resolution in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), integrating STM with light pulses has long been a key objective in ultrafast microscopy, spanning the picosecond and femtosecond domains, with first signatures of attosecond dynamics. However, while sub-cycle dynamics on the attosecond time scale are routinely controlled and determined with high precision, controlling the direction of attosecond currents and determining their duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunnelling currents using two-colour laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation reveals non-adiabatic tunnelling as the underlying physical mechanism, yielding a current burst duration of 860 as. Despite working under ambient conditions but free of thermal artifacts, we achieve sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity and a lateral spatial resolution of 2 nm. This unprecedented capability to directionally control attosecond bursts will enable triggering and imaging ultrafast charge dynamics in atomic, molecular and condensed systems at the spatio-temporal microscopy frontier of lightwave electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet in a Nutshell -- Advancing Quantum Communication with Ion Traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Internet in a Nutshell (QI-Nutshell) connects the fields of quantum communication and quantum computing by emulating quantum communication protocols on currently available ion-trap quantum computers. We demonstrate emulations of QKD protocols where the individual steps are mapped to physical operations within our hardware platform. This allows us to not only practically execute established protocols such as BB84 or BBM92, but also include cloning attacks by an eavesdropping party, noise sources and side-channel attacks that are generally hard to include in theoretical QKD security proofs. We deliberately inject noise and investigate its effect on quantum communication protocols. We employ numerical simulations in order to study the incorporation of small quantum error correction (QEC) codes into QKD protocols. We find that these codes can help to suppress the noise level and to monitor the noise profile of the channel. This may enable the communicating parties to detect suspicious deviations from expected noise characteristics as a result of potential eavesdropping. This suggests that QEC may serve as a means of privacy authentication for quantum communication without altering the transmitted quantum information.</description>

      <title>Covariant path integrals for quantum fields back-reacting on classical space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce configuration space path integrals for quantum fields interacting with classical fields. We show that this can be done consistently by proving that the dynamics are completely positive directly, without resorting to master equation methods. These path integrals allow one to readily impose space-time symmetries, including Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance. They generalize and combine the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and the stochastic path integral of classical stochastic dynamics while respecting symmetry principles. We introduce a path integral formulation of general relativity where the space-time metric is treated classically. The theory is a candidate for a fundamental theory that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics. The theory is manifestly covariant, and may be inequivalent to the theory derived using master-equation methods. We prove that entanglement cannot be created via the classical field, reinforcing proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity via entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits with gap-asymmetric junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits hold promise for quantum computing, but their operation is challenged by various sources of noise, including excitations known as quasiparticles. Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a charge operator supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher order conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Krylov space during finite precision Lanczos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Entrepreneurship Lab (QEL) is a one-semester, project-based course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), designed to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial application in the quantum sector. As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

      <title>Fast charge noise sensing using a spectator valley state in a singlet-triplet qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state. This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device parameters, sub-millisecond measurement times are possible using a quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, similar performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters. This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time, opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.</description>
