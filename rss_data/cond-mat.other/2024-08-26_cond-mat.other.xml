      <title>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates with relative motion. We model the degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field and select a nonlocal potential to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, assuming one plate slides relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. The numerical plots show that, as a function of momentum the vacuum occupation number is isotropic for a motion speed v = 0 and anisotropic for nonzero v. Due to energy transfer between the plates, the process of relative motion induces on-shell excitations, similar to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Therefore, we can study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces via quantum action. The numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action for the motion boost and the dissipative force have a threshold as a function of v, and both are positively correlated with v.</description>

      <title>He-4 monolayer on Graphene: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Convergence of Coupled Cluster Calculations of the Homogeneous Electron Gas Using Bayesian Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a system which has many applications in chemistry and physics. However, its infinite nature makes studies at the many-body level complicated due to long computational run times. Because it is size extensive, coupled cluster theory is capable of studying the homogeneous electron gas, but it still poses a large computational challenge as the time needed for precise calculations increases in a polynomial manner with the number of particles and single-particle states. Consequently, achieving convergence in energy calculations becomes challenging, if not prohibited, due to long computational run times and high computational resource requirements. This paper develops the sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) to predict the coupled cluster energies of the homogeneous electron gas in the complete basis limit using Bayesian ridge regression to make predictions from calculations at truncated basis sizes. Using the SRE method we were able to predict the coupled cluster doubles energies for the electron gas across a variety of values of N and $r_s$, for a total of 70 predictions, with an average error of 4.28x10$^{-4}$ Hartrees while saving 88.9 hours of computational time. The SRE method can accurately extrapolate electron gas energies to the complete basis limit, saving both computational time and resources. Additionally, the SRE is a general method that can be applied to a variety of systems, many-body methods, and extrapolations.</description>
