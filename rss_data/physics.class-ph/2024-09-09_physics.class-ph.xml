      <title>Modular Study of a Force-Magnetic Coupling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic-mechanical oscillating system consists of two identical leaf springs, a non-magnetic base, and some magnets. The leaf springs are fixed at the bottom to the non-magnetic base, while the magnet is attached to the top of the leaf springs. This paper investigates the overall motion characteristics of the magnetic-mechanical oscillating system. Adopting the modular modeling concept, we simplify the system into three inter-coupled modules: the leaf springs, magnetic interactions, and the system's dissipation process. We conduct physical modeling and theoretical analysis on these modules and derived the system's dynamic equations. The research indicates that the system is a normal mode system with two degrees of freedom. In addition, we alter parameters and conduct multiple innovative experiments, obtaining intuitive vibration images that characterize the vibration modes and the periodic energy transfer. Furthermore, we employ the simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics simulation to substitute the theory for auxiliary validation, achieving a comprehensive research loop of theory-experiment-simulation. The experimental results show good consistency with the theoretical calculations and simulation results. This research provides a good teaching case for magnetic-coupling complex systems. This modular analysis and rather practical experimental design could solve the previous difficulty that the solution to such problem is too complex, and is conducive to the implementation of education.</description>

      <title>Relativity with or without light and Maxwell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex relationship between Einstein's second postulate and the Maxwell electromagnetic theory is elucidated. A simple deduction of the main results of the Ignatowski approach to the theory of relativity is given. The peculiar status of the principle of relativity among the Maxwellians is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Revisiting tea-leaf paradox with a deformable stirrer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tea-leaf paradox refers to the unexpected migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the latter is mixed with a rigid spoon. We propose here to revisit this paradox by considering the case of a deformable spoon, which consists of a floating ball attached to a soft string set in circular motion through its other end. Doing so, one introduces some coupling between the ball's trajectory and the flow generated by its motion, leading to surprising effects. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which challenges common intuition based on centrifugal force and enriches the original paradox. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. A model explaining these observations is proposed, and validated using experimental measurements of the generated flow. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, showing that the ball can robustly trap itself at the center of the flow generated by its past motion.</description>
