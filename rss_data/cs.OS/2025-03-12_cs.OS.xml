      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Discrete World Models for Adaptive Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrate a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm with the DreamerV3 architecture to improve load balancing in operating systems. This approach enables rapid adaptation to dynamic workloads with minimal retraining, outperforming the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm in standard and adaptive trials. It demonstrates robust resilience to catastrophic forgetting, maintaining high performance under varying workload distributions and sizes. These findings have important implications for optimizing resource management and performance in modern operating systems. By addressing the challenges posed by dynamic and heterogeneous workloads, our approach advances the adaptability and efficiency of reinforcement learning in real-world system management tasks.</description>

      <title>KNighter: Transforming Static Analysis with LLM-Synthesized Checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.
  We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. 11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</description>
