      <title>Arithmetic Properties modulo powers of $2$ and $3$ for Overpartition $k$-Tuples with Odd Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Drema and N. Saikia (2023) and M. P. Saikia, Sarma, and Sellers (2023) proved several congruences modulo powers of $2$ for overpartition triples with odd parts. In this paper, we study further divisibility properties of overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts using elementary means as well as properties of modular forms. In particular, we prove several congruences modulo multiples of $3$, and an infinite family of congruences modulo powers of $3$; we also prove some cases of a conjecture of Saikia, Sarma, and Sellers.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Diophantine Equations Involving the Fibonacci Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a, b\in \mathbb{N}$ be relatively prime. Previous work showed that exactly one of the two equations $ax + by = (a-1)(b-1)/2$ and $ax + by + 1 = (a-1)(b-1)/2$ has a nonnegative, integral solution; furthermore, the solution is unique. Let $F_n$ be the $n$th Fibonacci number. When $(a,b) = (F_n, F_{n+1})$, it is known that there is an explicit formula for the unique solution $(x,y)$. We establish formulas to compute the solution when $(a,b) = (F_n^2, F_{n+1}^2)$ and $(F_n^3, F_{n+1}^3)$, giving rise to some intriguing identities involving Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, we construct a different pair of equations that admits a unique positive (instead of nonnegative), integral solution.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Diophantine approximation and Fourier dimension of sets: Dirichlet non-improvable numbers versus well-approximable numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E\subset [0,1]$ be a set that supports a probability measure $\mu$ with the property that $|\widehat{\mu}(t)|\ll (\log |t|)^{-A}$ for some constant $A&gt;2.$ Let $\mathcal{A}=(q_n)_{n\in \N}$ be a positive, real-valued, lacunary sequence. We present a quantitative inhomogeneous Khintchine-type theorem in which the points of interest are restricted to $E$ and the denominators of the shifted fractions are restricted to $\mathcal{A}.$ Our result improves and extends a previous result in this direction obtained by Pollington-Velani-Zafeiropoulos-Zorin (2022). We also show that the Dirichlet non-improvable set VS well-approximable set is of positive Fourier dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomials of degree $\frac{p-1}{2}$ of range sum $p$ was determined in {\tt arXiv:2311.06136 [math.NT]} for large enough primes. We extend this result by reducing the lower bound for the primes to $23$ by introducing a new and elementary way of estimating sums of Legendre symbols.</description>

      <title>Sums of two squares and the tau-function: Ramanujan's trail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan, in his famous first letter to Hardy, claimed a very precise estimate for the number of integers that can be written as a sum of two squares. Far less well-known is that he also made further claims of a similar nature for the non-divisibility of the Ramanujan tau-function for certain primes. In this survey, we provide more historical details and also discuss related later developments. These show that, as so often, Ramanujan was an explorer in a fascinating wilderness, leaving behind him a beckoning trail.</description>

      <title>Integer Factorization via Continued Fractions and Quadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel factorization algorithm that leverages the theory underlying the SQUFOF method, including reduced quadratic forms, infrastructural distance, and Gauss composition. We also present an analysis of our method, which has a computational complexity of $O \left( \exp \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{8}} \sqrt{\ln N \ln \ln N} \right) \right)$, making it more efficient than the classical SQUFOF and CFRAC algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm is polynomial-time, provided knowledge of a (not too large) multiple of the regulator of $\mathbb{Q}(N)$.</description>

      <title>A Deceptively Simple Quadratic Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>

      <title>On constructing zeta elements for Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel axiomatic framework for establishing horizontal norm relations in Euler systems that are built from pushforwards of classes in the motivic cohomology of Shimura varieties. This framework is uniformly applicable to the Euler systems of both algebraic cycles and Eisenstein classes. It also applies to non-spherical pairs of groups that fail to satisfy a local multiplicity one hypothesis, and thus lie beyond the reach of existing methods. A key application of this work is the construction of an Euler system for the spinor Galois representations arising in the cohomology of Siegel modular varieties of genus three, which is undertaken in two companion articles.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with good ordinary reduction at a prime $p\geq 5$, and let $F$ be an imaginary quadratic field. Under appropriate assumptions, we show that the Pontryagin dual of the fine Mordell-Weil group of $E$ over the $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension of $F$ is pseudo-null as a module over the Iwasawa algebra of the group $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$.</description>

      <title>Horizontal norm compatibility of cohomology classes for $\mathrm{GSp}_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish abstract horizontal norm relations involving the unramified Hecke-Frobenius polynomials that correspond under the Satake isomorhpism to the degree eight spinor $L$-factors of $ \mathrm{GSp}_{6} $. These relations apply to classes in the degree seven motivic cohomology of the Siegel modular sixfold obtained via Gysin pushforwards of Beilinson's Eisenstein symbol pulled back on one copy in a triple product of modular curves. The proof is based on a novel approach that circumvents the failure of the so-called multiplicity one hypothesis in our setting, which precludes the applicability of an existing technique. In a sequel, we combine our result with the previously established vertical norm relations for these classes to obtain new Euler systems for the eight dimensional Galois representations associated with certain non-endoscopic cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations of $ \mathrm{GSp}_{6} $.</description>

      <title>Rank fluctuations of matrix products and a moment method for growing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cokernel $G_n = \mathbf{Cok}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1)$ of a product of independent $n \times n$ random integer matrices with iid entries from generic nondegenerate distributions, in the regime where both $n$ and $k$ are sent to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this regime we show that the cokernel statistics converge universally to the reflecting Poisson sea, an interacting particle system constructed in arXiv:2312.11702, at the level of $1$-point marginals. In particular, $\operatorname{corank}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1 \pmod{p}) \sim \log_p k$, and its fluctuations are $O(1)$ and converge to a discrete random variable defined in arXiv:2310.12275.
  The main difference with previous works studying cokernels of random matrices is that $G_n$ does not converge to a random finite group; for instance, the $p$-rank of $G_n$ diverges. This means that the usual moment method for random groups does not apply. Instead, we proceed by proving a `rescaled moment method' theorem applicable to a general sequence of random groups of growing size. This result establishes that fluctuations of $p$-ranks and other statistics still converge to limit random variables, provided that certain rescaled moments $\mathbb{E}[\#\operatorname{Hom}(G_n,H)]/C(n,H)$ converge.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the second-order differential uniformity of vectorial Boolean functions, a relevant cryptographic property due to indication of resistance to the boomerang attack. First, we discuss connections with the second-order zero differential uniformity and its recent literature. We then prove the optimality of monomial functions with univariate form $x^d$ where $d=2^{2k}+2^k+1$ and $\gcd(k,n)=1$, and begin work towards generalising such conditions to all monomial functions of algebraic degree 3. Finally, we discuss further questions arising from computational results.</description>

      <title>Condensed Ricci Curvature on Paley Graphs and their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore properties of generalized Paley graphs and we extend a result of Lim and Praeger by providing a more precise description of the connected components of disconnected generalized Paley graphs. This result leads to a new characterization of when generalized Paley graphs are disconnected. We also provide necessary and sufficient divisibility conditions for the multiplicative group of the prime subfield of certain finite fields to be contained in the multiplicative subgroup of nonzero $k$-th powers. This latter result plays a crucial role in our development of a sorting algorithm on generalized Paley graphs that exploits the vector space structure of finite fields to partition certain subsets of vertices in a manner that decomposes the induced bipartite subgraph between them into complete balanced bipartite subgraphs. As a consequence, we establish a matching condition between these subsets of vertices that results in an explicit formula for the condensed Ricci curvature on certain Paley graphs and their generalizations.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. In the limit $N \to \infty$, we give a formula for general non-integer moments of the derivative for values of the spectral variable inside the unit disc. The formula we obtain is given in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function. We give an extension of this result to joint moments taken at different points, again valid for non-integer moment orders. For integer moments, our results simplify and are expressed as a single Laguerre polynomial. Using these moment formulae, we derive the mean counting function of zeros of the derivative in the limit $N \to \infty$. This motivated us to consider related questions for the derivative of the Riemann zeta function. Assuming the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we show that integer moments away from but approaching the critical line agree with our random matrix results. Within random matrix theory, we obtain an explicit expression for the integer moments, for finite matrix size, as a sum over partitions. We use this to obtain asymptotic formulae in a regime where the spectral variable approaches or is on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Automorphic line measures in the half-plane and the Grand Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poincare-type series, such as Selberg's, are known to produce automorphic functions, in the hyperbolic half-plane, the decompositions of which into eigenfunctions (genuine or generalized) of the automorphic Laplacian contain all modular forms of nonholomorphic type. We introduce a one-parameter family of explicit automorphic measures supported by discrete unions of congruent lines with the same property, except for one value of the real parameter, for which they miss exactly the Eisenstein series associated to non-trivial zeros of zeta, and the Hecke eigenforms the $L$-functions associated to which vanish as $\frac{1}{2}$.

      <title>Explicit Cocycle of the Dedekind-Rademacher Cohomology Class and the Darmon-Dasgupta Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work of Darmon, Pozzi, and Vonk has recently shown that the RM-values of the Dedekind-Rademacher cocycle $J_{DR}$ are Gross-Stark units up to a controlled torsion. In the aforementioned work, it is remarked that the measure-valued cohomology class $\mu_{DR}$ which underlies $J_{DR}$ is the level 1 incarnation of earlier constructions by Darmon and Dasgupta. In this paper, we make this relationship explicit by computing a concrete cocycle representative of $\mu_{DR}$ by tracing the construction of the cohomology class and comparing periods of weight 2 Eisenstein series. While maintaining a global perspective in our computations, we configure the appropriate method of smoothing cocycles which exactly yields the $p$-adic measures of Darmon and Dasgupta when applied to $\mu_{DR}$. These methods will also explain the optional degree zero condition imposed in Darmon and Dasgupta's work which was remarked upon in works of Fleischer and Liu as well as Dasgupta and Kakde.</description>

      <title>Finding Integral Points of Elliptic Curves over Imaginary Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the quadratic Chabauty set for integral points on elliptic curves of rank $2$ defined over imaginary quadratic fields using quadratic Chabauty. This builds on the work of Bianchi and Balakrishnan et al. We give the first instance of the implementation of anticyclotomic heights for curves which are not base changes, along with an implementation of a certain sieve for elliptic curves introduced by Balakrishnan et al. and used by Bianchi to determine integral points of rank $2$. We give the first example of the determination of the integral points of an elliptic curve of rank $2$ defined over an imaginary quadratic field, which is not a base change via quadratic Chabauty.</description>

      <title>On Widmer's criteria for the Northcott property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Widmer introduced a new sufficient criterion for the Northcott property on the finiteness of elements of bounded height in infinite algebraic extensions of number fields. We provide a simplification of Widmer's criterion when the extension is abelian, and use this to exhibit fields with the Northcott property that do not satisfy Widmer's new criterion. We also show how the construction of pseudo algebraically closed fields with the Northcott property, carried out in previous work using the first version of Widmer's criterion, can be simplified.</description>

      <title>Bielliptic Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with nontrivial level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work towards completely classifying all bielliptic Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with nontrivial level $N$ coprime to $D$, extending a result of Rotger that provided such a classification for level one. Combined with prior work, this allows us to determine the list of all relatively prime pairs $(D,N)$ for which $X_0^D(N)$ has infinitely many degree $2$ points. As an application, we use these results to make progress on determining which curves $X_0^D(N)$ have sporadic points. Using tools similar to those that appear in this study, we also determine all of the geometrically trigonal Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $\gcd(D,N)=1$ (none of which are trigonal over $\mathbb{Q}$).</description>

      <title>Sign changes of short character sums and real zeros of Fekete polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a general approach producing quantitative bounds on the number of sign changes of the weighted sums $$\sum_{n\le x}f(n)w_n$$ where $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a family of multiplicative functions and $w_n\in\mathbb{R}$ are certain weights.As a consequence, we show that for a typical fundamental discriminant $D,$ the partial sums of the real character $\chi_D$ change sign $\gg (\log\log D)/\log\log\log \log D$ times on very short initial interval (which goes beyond the range in Vinogradov's conjecture). We also prove that the number of real zeros (localized away from $1$) of the Fekete polynomial associated to a typical fundamental discriminant $D$ is $\gg \frac{\log\log D}{\log\log\log\log D}.$ This comes close to establishing a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery which predicts $\asymp \log \log D$ real zeros.
  Finally, the same approach shows that almost surely for large $x\ge 1$, the partial sums $\sum_{n\le y}f(n)$ of a (Rademacher) random multiplicative function exhibit $\gg \log \log x/\log \log\log\log x$ sign changes on the interval $[1,x].$
  These results rely crucially on uniform quantitative estimates for the joint distribution of $-\frac{L'}{L}(s, \chi_D)$ at several points $s$ in the vicinity of the central point $s=1/2$, as well as concentration results for $\log L(s,\chi_D)$ in the same range, which we establish. In the second part of the paper, we obtain, for large families of discriminants, ``non-trivial" upper bounds on the number of real zeros of Fekete polynomials, breaking the square root bound. Finally, we construct families of discriminants with associated Fekete polynomials having no zeros away from $1.$</description>

      <title>On Hyperk\"ahler manifolds of K3$^{[n]}$-type with large Picard number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by well-known examples of hyperk\"ahler manifolds, we show that any hyperk\"ahler manifold $X$ of K3$^{[n]}$-type with Picard number $\rho(X) \geq 4$ is always isomorphic to a moduli space of twisted stable sheaves on a K3 surface. Additionally, we provide explicit descriptions of hyperk\"ahler manifolds of K3$^{[n]}$-type with Picard ranks below this crucial value (e.g., $\rho(X)=3$) that are not birational to such moduli spaces.</description>
