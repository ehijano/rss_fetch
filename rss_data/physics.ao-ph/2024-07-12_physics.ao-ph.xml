      <title>Alternative climatic steady states for the Permian-Triassic paleogeography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence: introducing the weighted Bayesian update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent environments is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. Given the practical impossibility of achieving a fully consistent turbulent model and guaranteeing convergence to the correct solution, we propose a method to rank 'many wrong models' and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Planetary Atmosphere Simulations with a Surrogate Radiative Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 101 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.</description>
