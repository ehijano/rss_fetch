      <title>Bistability and chaos in the discrete two-gene Andrecut-Kauffman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct numerical analysis of the 2-dimensional discrete-time gene expression model originally introduced by Andrecut and Kauffman (Phys. Lett. A 367: 281-287, 2007). In contrast to the previous studies, we analyze the dynamics with different reaction rates $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ for each of the two genes under consideration. We explore bifurcation diagrams for the system with $\alpha_1$ varying in a wide range and $\alpha_2$ fixed. We detect chaotic dynamics by means of a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent and we scan through selected parameters to detect those combinations for which chaotic dynamics can be found in the system. Moreover, we find bistability in the model, that is, the existence of two disjoint attractors. Both situations are interesting from the point of view of applications, as they imply unpredictability of the system. Finally, we show some specific values of parameters of the model in which the two attractors are of different kind (a periodic orbit and a chaotic attractor) or of the same kind (two periodic orbits or two chaotic attractors).</description>

      <title>Rare events for low energy domain in bouncing ball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution for multiple collisions observed in the chaotic low energy domain in the bouncing ball model is shown to be scaling invariant concerning the control parameters. The model considers the dynamics of a bouncing ball particle colliding elastically with two rigid walls. One is fixed, and the other one moves periodically in time. The dynamics is described by a two-dimensional mapping for the variables velocity of the particle and phase of the moving wall. For a specific combination of velocity and phase, the particle may experience a type of rare collision named successive collisions. We show that a power law describes the probability distribution of the multiple impacts and is scaling invariant to the control parameter.</description>

      <title>On forced swarmalators that move in higher-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective dynamics of swarmalators subjected to periodic (sinusoidal) forcing. Although previous research focused on the simplified case of motion in a one-dimensional (1D) periodic domain, we extend this analysis to the more realistic scenario of motion in two and three spatial dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. In doing so, we identify analogues of the 1D states and characterize their dynamics and stability boundaries analytically. Additionally, we investigate the forced swarmalators model with power-law interaction kernels, finding that the analytically tractable model with periodic boundary conditions can reproduce the observed dynamic behaviors of this more complex model.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. We further analyse the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <title>Coupling-Induced Synchronized Motion and Stochastic Resonance in Overdamped Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore an overdamped system of a dimer in a bistable potential immersed in a heat bath. The monomers interact via the combination of the Lennard-Jones potential and the harmonic potential. We have introduced a short-range interaction in our model making it more physical. Such a classical system can be used as a model for stochastic resonance (SR) based energy harvesters where the interplay between the noise, coupling and a periodic perturbation leads to a rich class of dynamical behaviours. A key distinction between observing SR in single and coupled particle studies is that a transition between the two wells is only considered successful if both the particles cross a certain threshold position. Although we observe qualitatively a similar peaking behaviour in different quantifiers of SR (like input energy ($W_p$) and hysteresis loop area (HLA)), the effects of the above-mentioned condition on the dynamics of the system remain unaddressed to the best of our knowledge. We study SR using different measures like the input energy per period of the external forcing, the hysteresis loop area as well as quantities like phase lag between the response and the external forcing and the maximum average amplitude of the response. Additionally, we have defined a new quantity called the successful transition ratio. This ratio helps us understand the effects of the dimer's coupling on the number of successful transitions out of the total attempted transitions. The successful transition ratio is almost unity for strongly coupled dimer suggesting most of the transition attempts end up successfully however few they are in numbers. On the other hand, the ratio shows a peaking behaviour with respect to noise for weak and intermediate couplings. We show that only for the weakly coupled dimer, the ratio is maximum around the temperature where SR takes place.</description>
