      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a stochastic SVEIS epidemic model using Black-Karasinski process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a stochastic SVEIS epidemic model perturbed by a Black-Karasinski process. Using a Lyapunov functional approach, we derive a sufficient condition, Rs0&gt;1 for the existence of a stationary distribution, which indicates disease persistence. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the disease will die out at an exponential rate if Re0&lt;1 . Our results show that random fluctuations will facilitate disease outbreak.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Characterizing Finite Discrete Distributions with Generalized Shannon's Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes necessary and sufficient conditions under which a finite set of Generalized Shannon's Entropy (GSE) characterizes a finite discrete distribution up to permutation. For an alphabet of cardinality K, it is shown that K-1 distinct positive real orders of GSE are sufficient (and necessary if no multiplicity) to identify the distribution up to permutation. When the distribution has a known multiplicity structure with s distinct values, s-1 orders are sufficient and necessary. These results provide a label-invariant foundation for inference on unordered sample spaces and enable practical goodness-of-fit procedures across disparate alphabets. The findings also suggest new approaches for testing, estimation, and model comparison in settings where moment-based and link-based methods are inadequate.</description>

      <title>Last Hitting Time Distributions for Solvable Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering any one-dimensional time-homogeneous solvable diffusion process,this paper develops a complete analytical framework for computing the distribution of the last hitting time, to any level, and its joint distribution with the process value on any finite time horizon. Our formalism allows for regular diffusions with any type of endpoint boundaries. We exploit the inherent link between last and first hitting times. The simpler known formula for the marginal distribution of the last hitting time on an infinite time horizon is easily recovered as a special limit. Furthermore, we derive general formulae for each component of the joint distribution, i.e., the jointly continuous, the partly continuous (defective) and the jointly defective portions. By employing spectral expansions of the transition densities and the first hitting time distributions, our derivations culminate in novel general spectral expansions for both marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon.
  An additional main contribution of this paper lies in the application of our general formulae, giving rise to newly closed-form analytical formulae for several solvable diffusions. In particular, we systematically derive analytical expressions for each portion of the marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon, without and with imposed killing at one or two interior points, for Brownian motion, Brownian motion with drift (geometric Brownian motion), the squared Bessel , squared radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (CIR) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Most of our formulae are given in terms of spectral series that are rapidly convergent and efficiently implemented. We demonstrate this by presenting some numerical calculations of marginal and joint distributions using accurately truncated series.</description>

      <title>Reversibility, covariance and coarse-graining for Langevin dynamics: On the choice of multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between reversibility, geometry, and the choice of multiplicative noise (in particular It\^{o}, Stratonovich, Klimontovich) in stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Building on a unified geometric framework, we derive algebraic conditions under which a diffusion process is reversible with respect to a Gibbs measure on a Riemannian manifold. The condition depends continuously on a parameter $\lambda \in [0,1]$ which interpolates between the conventions of It\^o ($\lambda = 0$), Stratonovich ($\lambda = \frac 1 2$) and Klimontovich ($\lambda = 1$). For reversible slow-fast systems of SDEs with a block-diagonal diffusion structure, we show, using the theory of Dirichlet forms, that both reversibility and the Klimontovich noise interpretation are preserved under coarse-graining.
  In particular, we prove that the effective dynamics for the slow variables, obtained via projection onto a lower-dimensional manifold, retain the Klimontovich interpretation and remain reversible with respect to the marginal Gibbs measure/free energy.
  Our results provide a flexible variational framework for modeling coarse-grained reversible dynamics with nontrivial geometric and noise structures.</description>

      <title>Noise induced Stability of a Mean-Field model of Systemic Risk with uncertain robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for systemic risk comprising of a system of diffusion processes, interacting through their empirical mean. Each process is subject to a confining double-well potential with some uncertainty in the coefficients, corresponding to fluctuations in height of the potential barrier seperating the two wells. This is equivalent to studying a single McKean-Vlasov SDE with explicit dependence on its moments and, novelly, independently varying additive and multiplicative noise. Such non-linear SDEs are known to possess two phases: stable (ordered) and unstable (disordered). When the potential is purely bistable, the phase changes from stable to unstable when noise intensity is increased past a critical threshold. With the recent advances, it will be shown that the behaviour here is far richer: indeed, depending on the interpretation of the stochastic integral, the system exhibits phase changes that cannot occur in any regime where there is no uncertainty in the potential. Strikingly, this allows for the phenomenon of noise induced stability; situations where more noise can reduce the risk of system failure.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the second eigenspace of the interchange process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral gap theorem of Caputo, Liggett, and Richthammer states that on any connected graph equipped with edge weights, the 2nd eigenvalue of the interchange process equals the 2nd eigenvalue of the random walk process. In this work we characterize the 2nd eigenspace of the interchange process. We prove that this eigenspace is uniquely determined by the 2nd eigenvectors of the random walk process on every connected weighted graph except the $4$-cycle with uniform edge weights. The key to our proof is an induction scheme on the number of vertices, and involves the octopus (in)equality, representation theoretic computations, and graph Laplacian computations.</description>

      <title>On a Stationarity Theory for Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provide a comprehensive analysis of the finite and long time behavior of continuous-time non-Markovian dynamical systems, with a focus on the forward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations(SVIEs).We investigate the properties of solutions to such equations specifically their stationarity, both over a finite horizon and in the long run. In particular, we demonstrate that such an equation does not exhibit a strong stationary regime unless the kernel is constant or in a degenerate settings. However, we show that it is possible to induce a $\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. This effect is achieved by introducing a deterministic stabilizer $\varsigma$ associated with the kernel.We also look at the $L^p$ -confluence (for $p&gt;0$) of such process as time goes to infinity(i.e. we investigate if its marginals when starting from various initial values are confluent in $L^p$ as time goes to infinity) and finally the functional weak long-run assymptotics for some classes of diffusion coefficients. Those results are applied to the case of Exponential-Fractional Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations, with an $\alpha$-gamma fractional integration kernel, where $\alpha\leq 1$ enters the regime of $\textit{rough path}$ whereas $\alpha&gt; 1$ regularizes diffusion paths and invoke $\textit{long-term memory}$, persistence or long range dependence. With this fake stationary Volterra processes, we introduce a family of stabilized volatility models.</description>

      <title>A Rernomalisation Group Map for Short- and Long-ranged Weakly Coupled $|\varphi|^4$ Models in $d \ge 4$ at and Above the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct and analyse a renormalisation group (RG) map for the weakly coupled $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model under periodic boundary conditions in dimension $d \ge 4$. Both short-range and long-range interactions with upper critical dimension four are considered. This extends and refines the RG map constructed by Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade for the short-range model at $d=4$. This extension opens the door to establishing the exact decay rate of correlation functions of all of the models discussed. Furthermore, incorporating a large-field decay estimate and comparing with the finite-size scaling results of Michta, Park, and Slade, our analysis provides strong evidence for the emergence of a plateau in systems of finite volume with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Ising model with external magnetic field on random planar maps: Critical exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ising model with an external magnetic field on random tetravalent planar maps and investigate its critical behavior. Explicit expressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed and the critical exponents $\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition), $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at zero external magnetic field) and $\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical temperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field using analytic combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.</description>

      <title>An identity involving counts of binary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the proposition shown below and explore some of its consequences. For a sequence $p=(p_1,p_2,\dots)$ of non-negative integers, set $|p| = \sum_{i\geq 1} p_i$ and let $[p] = (\#\{j: p_j=i\})_{i\geq 1}$ count the number of occurrences of $i\geq 1$ in $p$, so that $|[p]|$ is the number of non-zero elements in $p$. For $p\in \mathbb N_0^\infty$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, we write $p!$ and $x^{\underline{p}}$ for the product of factorials $\prod_{i\geq 1}p_i!$ and of falling factorials $\prod_{i\geq 1} x^{\underline{p_i}}$, respectively. If $p$ is an integer partition of $m$, i.e., if $|p|=m$ and $p_1\geq p_2 \geq \dots$, we write $p \vdash m$. Given two integer partitions $p$ and $q$ of $m$, let $N(p,q)$ denote the number of $|[p]|\times |[q]|$ binary matrices whose row-and column-sums equal $p$ and $q$, respectively (for $m=0$, this number is to be interpreted as one).
  Proposition: For $q \vdash m$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, we have $$\sum_{p \vdash m} \frac{x^{\underline{|[p]|}}}{[p]!} N(p,q) \quad=\quad \frac{x^{\underline{q}}}{q!}.$$</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotic analysis of Sobolev training for random feature models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient information is widely useful and available in applications, and is therefore natural to include in the training of neural networks. Yet little is known theoretically about the impact of Sobolev training -- regression with both function and gradient data -- on the generalization error of highly overparameterized predictive models in high dimensions. In this paper, we obtain a precise characterization of this training modality for random feature (RF) models in the limit where the number of trainable parameters, input dimensions, and training data tend proportionally to infinity. Our model for Sobolev training reflects practical implementations by sketching gradient data onto finite dimensional subspaces. By combining the replica method from statistical physics with linearizations in operator-valued free probability theory, we derive a closed-form description for the generalization errors of the trained RF models. For target functions described by single-index models, we demonstrate that supplementing function data with additional gradient data does not universally improve predictive performance. Rather, the degree of overparameterization should inform the choice of training method. More broadly, our results identify settings where models perform optimally by interpolating noisy function and gradient data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <title>HJB equations driven by the Dirichlet-Ferguson Laplacian in Wasserstein-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear and nonlinear PDEs defined on the space of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T}^d)$ over the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, equipped with the Dirichlet-Ferguson measure $\mathcal{D}$. We first develop an analytic framework based on the Wasserstein-Sobolev space $H^{1,2}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T}^d), W_2, \mathcal{D})$ associated with the Dirichlet form induced by the infinite-dimensional Laplacian acting on functions of measures. Within this setting, we establish existence and uniqueness results for transport-diffusion and Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space. Our analysis connects the PDE approach with a corresponding interacting particles system providing a probabilistic (Kolmogorov-type) representation of strong solutions. Finally, we extend the theory to semilinear equations and mean-field optimal control problems, together with consistent finite-dimensional approximations.</description>

Abstract: We study the mean field Langevin dynamics and the associated particle system. By assuming the functional convexity of the energy, we obtain the $L^p$-convergence of the marginal distributions towards the unique invariant measure for the mean field dynamics. Furthermore, we prove the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos in both the $L^2$-Wasserstein metric and relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Random coverage from within with variable radii, and Johnson-Mehl cover times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact planar region $A$, let $\tau_A$ be the (random) time it takes for the Johnson-Mehl tessellation of $A$ to be complete, i.e. the time it takes for $A$ to be fully covered by a spatial birth-growth process in $A$ with seeds arriving as a unit-intensity Poisson point process in $A \times [0,\infty)$, where upon arrival each seed grows at unit rate in all directions. We show that if $\partial A$ is smooth or polygonal then $\Pr [ \pi \tau_{sA}^3 - 6 \log s - 4 \log \log s \leq x]$ tends to $\exp(- (\frac{81}{4\pi})^{1/3} |A|e^{-x/3} -(\frac{9}{2\pi^2})^{1/3} |\partial A| e^{-x/6})$ in the large-$s$ limit; the second term in the exponent is due to boundary effects, the importance of which was not recognized in earlier work on this model. We present similar results in higher dimensions (where boundary effects dominate). These results are derived using new results on the asymptotic probability of covering $A$ with a high-intensity spherical Poisson Boolean model restricted to $A$ with grains having iid small random radii, which generalize recent work of the first author that dealt only with grains of deterministic radius.</description>

      <title>Multifractal spectrum of branching random walks on free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric branching random walk (BRW) on a free group $\mathbb{F}$ is transient if and only if the mean offspring number $r$ does not exceed $R$, the reciprocal of the spectral radius of the underlying random walk. In this regime, the limit set $\Lambda_r$ -- consisting of all ends of $\mathbb{F}$ to which the BRW's particle trajectories converge -- is a proper random subset of the boundary $\partial \mathbb{F}$. Hueter and Lalley (2000) determined the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda_r$ and proved that $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} \Lambda_r \le (1/2)\dim_{\mathrm{H}} \partial \mathbb{F}$, with equality possible only when $r = R$.
  In this paper, we further extend this study by conducting a multifractal analysis of the limit set $\Lambda_r$. We obtain the Hausdorff dimensions of the subfractals $\Lambda_r(\alpha) \subset \Lambda_r$, which consist of all ends of $\mathbb{F}$ approached by particle trajectories escaping at rate $\alpha \in [0,1]$. Notably, there exists a unique $\alpha(r) \in [0,1]$ such that \[
  \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \Lambda_r = \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \Lambda_r(\alpha(r)). \] Moreover, an interesting phase transition occurs: $\alpha(r) &gt; 0$ for $r &lt; R$ while $\alpha(R) = 0$.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR processes: Weak-error bounds and option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper links nearly unstable, heavy-tailed \emph{bivariate cumulative} INAR($\infty$) processes to the rough Heston model via a discrete scaling limit, extending scaling-limit techniques beyond Hawkes processes and providing a microstructural mechanism for rough volatility and leverage effect. Computationally, we simulate the \emph{approximating INAR($\infty$)} sequence rather than discretizing the Volterra SDE, and implement the long-memory convolution with a \emph{divide-and-conquer FFT} (CDQ) that reuses past transforms, yielding an efficient Monte Carlo engine for \emph{European options} and \emph{path-dependent options} (Asian, lookback, barrier). We further derive finite-horizon \emph{weak-error bounds} for option pricing under our microstructural approximation. Numerical experiments show tight confidence intervals with improved efficiency; as $\alpha \to 1$, results align with the classical Heston benchmark, where $\alpha$ is the roughness specification. Using the simulator, we also study the \emph{implied-volatility surface}: the roughness specification ($\alpha&lt;1$) reproduces key empirical features -- most notably the steep short-maturity ATM skew with power-law decay -- whereas the classical model produces a much flatter skew.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of interacting particle systems on dynamic random networks, in which the joint dynamics of vertices and edges acts as one-way feedback, i.e., edges appear and disappear over time depending on the state of the two connected vertices, while the vertex dynamics does not depend on the edge process. Our goal is to estimate the underlying dynamics from partial information of the process, specifically from snapshots of the total number of edges present. We showcase the effectiveness of our inference method through various numerical results.</description>

      <title>Moments of density-dependent branching processes and their genealogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A density-dependent branching process is a particle system in which individuals reproduce independently, but in a way that depends on the current population size. This feature can model a wide range of ecological interactions at the cost of breaking the branching property. We propose a general approach for studying the genealogy of these models based on moments. Building on a recent work of Bansaye, we show how to compute recursively these moments in a similar spirit to the many-to-few formula in the theory of branching processes. These formulas enable one to deduce the convergence of the genealogy by studying the population density, for which stochastic calculus techniques are available. As a first application of these ideas, we consider a density-dependent branching process started close to a stable equilibrium of the ecological dynamics. We show that, under a finite second moment assumption, its genealogy converges to Kingman's coalescent when the carrying capacity of the population goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local non-extendability of random power series beyond their disk of convergence. We show that random power series formed by independent coefficients which are asymptotically anti-concentrated admit the circle of radius of convergence as strong natural boundary, even in a Nevanlinna sense. Our results extend previous work of Breuer and Simon (2011) for the case of independent coefficients. Our motivation stems from the study of Pad\'e approximants of random power series as a denoising tool.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent applications in deriving stochastic transport models for fluid dynamics. In this work, we first derive the stochastic Lagrange-to-Euler map that underpins stochastic transport noise in fluid dynamics as the homogenisation limit of a parameterised flow map decomposing into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove convergence of this parameterised flow map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component converges to a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms that transforms the full flow dynamics into an SDE-governed stochastic flow through composition, while the slow component requires closure.
  Our second contribution formulates two distinct variational closures for the slow component of the homogenised flow that exploit the composite structure of the stochastic flow. For the first closure, the critical points of a new variational principle satisfy a system of random-coefficient PDEs, which can be transformed into a system of stochastic PDEs via the coadjoint action of the stochastic flow map obtained from homogenising the fluctuating component. We show that these equations coincide with the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). For the second closure, we modify the assumptions on the slow component and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work on mean flow dynamics such as the Generalised Lagrangian Mean.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive an expression for the expected number of runs in a trace of a binary sequence $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ obtained by passing $x$ through a deletion channel that independently deletes each bit with probability $q$. We use this expression to show that if $x$ is a codeword of a first-order Reed-Muller code, and the deletion probability $q$ is 1/2, then $x$ can be reconstructed, with high probability, from $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ many of its traces.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantities determining the critical inverse temperature in the annealed Potts model with Pareto vertex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider in this work the crucial quantity $t_c$ that determines the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ in the $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs where the vertices are equipped with a Pareto weight density $(\tau-1)\,w^{-\tau}\,{\cal X}_{[1,\infty)}(w)$. It is shown in \cite{ref1} that this $t_c$ is the unique positive zero of a function ${\cal K}$ that is obtained by an appropriate combination of the stationarity condition and the criticality condition for the case the external field $B$ equals 0 and that $q\geq3$ and $\tau\geq4$, see \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14 and Theorem ~1.21 and their proofs in \cite{ref1}, Section~7.1 and Section~7.3. From the proof of \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14, it is seen that ${\cal K}'$ and ${\cal K}''$ also have a unique positive zero, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$, respectively, and $t_c'=t_b$ and $t_c''=t_{\ast}$, where $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ are the unique positive zeros of ${\cal F}_0(t)-t\,{\cal F}_0'(t)$ and ${\cal F}_0''(t)$, respectively. Here, ${\cal F}_0(t)=E\,[W(e^{tW}-1)/(E\,[W]\,(e^{tW}+q-1))]$, and $t_c$, $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ play a key role in the graphical analysis of \cite{ref1}, Section~5.1 and Figure~1. Furthermore, $\gamma_c=\exp(\beta_c)-1$ and $t_c$ are related according to $\gamma_c=t_c/{\cal F}_0(t_c)$.
  We analyse $t_c$, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$ for general real $\tau\geq4$ and general real $q&gt;2$ by an appropriate formulation of their defining equations ${\cal K}(t_c)={\cal K}'(t_c')={\cal K}''(t_c'')=0$. Thus we find, along with the inequality $0&lt;t_c''&lt;t_c'&lt;t_c&lt;\infty$, the simple upper bounds $t_c&lt;2\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c'&lt;\frac32\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c''&lt;{\rm ln}(q-1)$, as well as certain sharpenings of these simple bounds and counterparts about the large-$q$ behaviour of $t_c$, $t_c$ and $t_c''$. We show that these bounds are sharp in the sense that they hold with equality for the limiting homogeneous case $\tau\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Distances between non-symmetric convex bodies: optimal bounds up to polylog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the non-symmetric Banach-Mazur distance between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies $$ d_{BM}(K_1, K_2) \leq C n \cdot \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ for universal constants $C, \alpha &gt; 0$. This improves upon the earlier bound $C n^{4/3} \log^{\alpha} (n+1)$ due to Rudelson. Up to polylogarithmic factors, our estimate is optimal and it also matches the optimal bound in the centrally-symmetric case which is realized in the John position, as proven by Gluskin. The bound above for the Banach-Mazur distance is attained when both bodies are in a ``random isotropic position'', that is, in isotropic position after a random rotation. Our proof is based on an $M$-bound in the isotropic position, which complements E. Milman's $M^*$-bound. In addition, we consider the partial containment distance $d_{PC}(K_1, K_2)$ between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, where the Banach-Mazur requirement to contain $100\%$ of the other body is relaxed to $99\%$-containment. We prove that for any pair of convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, $$ d_{PC}(K_1, K_2) \leq C \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ and that any isotropic position of $K_1$ and $K_2$ yields this polylogarithmic bound for $d_{PC}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <title>Stochastic representation of solutions for the parabolic Cauchy problem with variable exponent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponent coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>
