      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the coupled Lakshmanan-Porsezian-Daniel equation with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of solving the initial value problem for the coupled Lakshmanan Porsezian Daniel equation, while considering nonzero boundary conditions at infinity, is addressed through the development of a suitable inverse scattering transform. Analytical properties of the Jost eigenfunctions are examined, along with the analysis of scattering coefficient characteristics. This analysis leads to the derivation of additional auxiliary eigenfunctions necessary for the comprehensive investigation of the fundamental eigenfunctions. Two symmetry conditions are discussed to study the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients. These symmetry results are utilized to rigorously define the discrete spectrum and ascertain the corresponding symmetries of scattering datas. The inverse scattering problem is formulated by the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Then we can derive the exact solutions by coupled Lakshmanan Porsezian Daniel equation, the novel soliton solutions are derived and examined in detail.</description>

      <title>Rational Q-systems at Root of Unity I. Closed Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solution of Bethe ansatz equations for XXZ spin chain with the parameter $q$ being a root of unity is infamously subtle. In this work, we develop the rational $Q$-system for this case, which offers a systematic way to find all physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations at root of unity. The construction contains two parts. In the first part, we impose additional constraints to the rational $Q$-system. These constraints eliminate the so-called Fabricius-McCoy (FM) string solutions, yielding all primitive solutions. In the second part, we give a simple procedure to construct the descendant tower of any given primitive state. The primitive solutions together with their descendant towers constitute the complete Hilbert space. We test our proposal by extensive numerical checks and apply it to compute the torus partition function of the 6-vertex model at root of unity.</description>

      <title>From integrability to chaos: the quantum-classical correspondence in a triple well bosonic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the classical and quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.</description>
