      <title>On the relation between magnetic field strength and gas density in the interstellar medium: A multiscale analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between magnetic field strength B and gas density n in the interstellar medium is of fundamental importance to many areas of astrophysics, from protostellar disks to galaxy evolution. We present and compare Bayesian analyses of the B - n relation for a comprehensive observational data set, as well as a large body of numerical MHD simulations. We extend the original Zeeman relation of Crutcher et al. (2010) with a large body of magnetic data that includes 700 observations with the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. By using a new multiparameter Bayesian analysis we present a new, more general, time-averaged observational relation: B \propto n^{0.27 \pm 0.017} for n \leq n_0 and B \propto n^{0.54 \pm 0.18} for n \geq n_0, with n_0 = 924^(+145-144) cm^-3. We perform a separate analysis on 19 numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations that cover a wide range of scales, resolutions, initial conditions, and completed with a variety of codes: arepo, flash, pencil, and ramses. The power law exponents derived from the simulations depend on several physical factors including: dynamo effects, time scales, turbulence, and the initial seed field strength. In particular, early-time simulations where the density, velocity and magnetic fields are unevolved do not match the observational scalings. The simulations that trace the observed density range best, the evolved dwarf galaxy and Milky Way like galaxy simulations, settle into a near consistent exponent of = 0.5 in the dense gas, with variability in the diffuse gas exponent.</description>

      <title>The supermassive black hole merger driven evolution of high-redshift red nuggets into present-day cored early-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very compact ($R_\mathrm{e}\lesssim1$ kpc) massive quiescent galaxies (red nuggets) are more abundant in the high-redshift Universe ($z\sim2$-$3$) than today. Their size evolution can be explained by collisionless dynamical processes in galaxy mergers which, however, fail to reproduce the diffuse low-density central cores in the local massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use sequences of major and minor merger N-body simulations starting with compact spherical and disk-like progenitor models to investigate the impact of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the evolution of the galaxies. With the KETJU code we accurately follow the collisional interaction of the SMBHs with the nearby stellar population and the collisionless evolution of the galaxies and their dark matter halos. We show that only models including SMBHs can simultaneously explain the formation of low-density cores up to sizes of $R_\mathrm{b} \sim 1.3$ kpc with mass deficits in the observed range and the rapid half-mass size evolution. In addition, the orbital structure in the core region (tangentially biased orbits) is consistent with observation-based results for local cored ETGs. The displacement of stars by the SMBHs boost the half-mass size evolution by up to a factor of two and even fast rotating progenitors (compact quiescent disks) lose their rotational support after $6$-$8$ mergers. We conclude that the presence of SMBHs is required for merger driven evolution models of high redshift red nuggets into local ETGs.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>Relative Alignments Between Magnetic Fields, Velocity Gradients, and Dust Emission Gradients in NGC 1333</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play an important role in shaping and regulating star formation in molecular clouds. Here, we present one of the first studies examining the relative orientations between magnetic ($B$) fields and the dust emission, gas column density, and velocity centroid gradients on the 0.02 pc (core) scales, using the BISTRO and VLA+GBT observations of the NGC 1333 star-forming clump. We quantified these relative orientations using the Project Rayleigh Statistic (PRS) and found preferential global parallel alignment between the $B$ field and dust emission gradients, consistent with large-scale studies with Planck. No preferential global alignments, however, are found between the $B$ field and velocity gradients. Local PRS calculated for subregions defined by either dust emission or velocity coherence further revealed that the $B$ field does not preferentially align with dust emission gradients in most emission-defined subregions, except in the warmest ones. The velocity-coherent structures, on the other hand, also showed no preferred $B$ field alignments with velocity gradients, except for one potentially bubble-compressed region. Interestingly, the velocity gradient magnitude in NGC 1333 ubiquitously features prominent ripple-like structures that are indicative of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Finally, we found $B$ field alignments with the emission gradients to correlate with dust temperature and anticorrelate with column density, velocity dispersion, and velocity gradient magnitude. The latter two anticorrelations suggest that alignments between gas structures and $B$ fields can be perturbed by physical processes that elevate velocity dispersion and velocity gradients, such as infall, accretions, and MHD waves.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in UNIONS -- I: A Simulation-driven Hybrid Deep Learning Ensemble for Pure Galaxy Merger Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging and interactions can radically transform galaxies. However, identifying these events based solely on structure is challenging as the status of observed mergers is not easily accessible. Fortunately, cosmological simulations are now able to produce more realistic galaxy morphologies, allowing us to directly trace galaxy transformation throughout the merger sequence. To advance the potential of observational analysis closer to what is possible in simulations, we introduce a supervised deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) hybrid framework, Mummi (MUlti Model Merger Identifier). Mummi is trained on realism-added synthetic data from IllustrisTNG100-1, and is comprised of a multi-step ensemble of models to identify mergers and non-mergers, and to subsequently classify the mergers as interacting pairs or post-mergers. To train this ensemble of models, we generate a large imaging dataset of 6.4 million images targeting UNIONS with RealSimCFIS. We show that Mummi offers a significant improvement over many previous machine learning classifiers, achieving 95% pure classifications even at Gyr long timescales when using a jury-based decision making process, mitigating class imbalance issues that arise when identifying real galaxy mergers from $z=0$ to $0.3$. Additionally, we can divide the identified mergers into pairs and post-mergers at 96% success rate. We drastically decrease the false positive rate in galaxy merger samples by 75%. By applying Mummi to the UNIONS DR5-SDSS DR7 overlap, we report a catalog of 13,448 high confidence galaxy merger candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that Mummi produces powerful representations solely using supervised learning, which can be used to bridge galaxy morphologies in simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Establishing HI mass v.s. stellar mass and halo mass scaling relations using an abundance matching method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combined data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) to establish the HI mass vs. stellar mass and halo mass scaling relations using an abundance matching method that is free of the Malmquist bias. To enable abundance matching, a cross-match between the SDSS DR7 galaxy group sample and the ALFALFA HI sources provides a catalog of 16,520 HI-galaxy pairs within 14,270 galaxy groups (halos). By applying the observational completeness reductions for both optical and HI observations, we used the remaining 8,180 ALFALFA matched sources to construct the model constraints. Taking into account the dependence of HI mass on both the galaxy and group properties, we establish two sets of scaling relations: one with a combination of stellar mass, $({g-r})$ color and halo mass, and the other with stellar mass, specific star-formation rate ($\rm sSFR$), and halo mass. We demonstrate that our models can reproduce the HI mass component as both a stellar and halo mass. Additional tests showed that the conditional HI mass distributions as a function of the cosmic web type and the satellite fractions were well recovered.</description>

      <title>Ionized and cold gas components in low surface brightness galaxy AGC 102004</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the integral field spectroscopic observations of ionized gas (H$\alpha$ and [{\ion{N}{II}}]) using the PCWI, along with deep CO(2-1) observations by the $^\backprime\bar{\rm U}^\backprime\bar{\rm u}$ receiver on JCMT for AGC 102004. The velocity field of H$\alpha$ shows an anomalous distribution in the North-Western (NW) disk. The H$\alpha$ spectrum is well-fitted by two Gaussian components, and the weak Gaussian component is dominated by the anomalous H$\alpha$ in the NW disk. The Gaussian fit center of H$\alpha$ emission is offset by +24.2 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity obtained from the HI emission. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using [{\ion{N}{II}}]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ ratio as a proxy. The mean value of 12+log(O/H) is 8.30 $\pm$ 0.19 over the whole galaxy. The metallicity in the outer disk is lower than the detection limit of 7.72, indicating the metallicity gradient exists in AGC 102004. We speculate a minor/mini-merger event could have happened to the NW disk. CO(2-1) emission has non-detection in AGC 102004, reaching a noise level of 0.33 mK smoothed to 30 km s$^{-1}$. The upper limit of molecular gas mass in AGC 102004 is 2.1 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$\odot$ with X$_{\rm CO}$ = 3.02$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. The M$_{\rm H_2}$/M$^{\rm corr}_{\rm HI}$ of AGC 102004 is lower than 0.0037 and lower than that of normal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Testing Lyman Alpha Emitters and Lyman-Break Galaxies as Tracers of Large-Scale Structures at High Redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test whether Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Ly{\alpha} emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broad-band magnitudes at z~2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Great Wave: Evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation propagating outwards in the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of two samples of young stars in the Galactic disc, containing respectively young giants ($\sim$16000 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$7 kpc) and classical Cepheids ($\sim$3400 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$15 kpc). Both samples show evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation on top of the warp of the Milky Way, which has a vertical height of 150-200 pc, a radial width of about 3 kpc, and a total length of at least 10 kpc, possibly reaching 20 kpc with the Cepheid sample. The stars in the corrugation exhibit both radial and vertical systematic motions, with Galactocentric radial velocities towards the outer disc of about 10-15 km/s. In the vertical motions, once the warp signature is subtracted, the residuals show a large-scale feature of systematically positive vertical velocities, which is located radially outwards with respect to the corrugation, and whose line of maxima approximately coincides with the line of null vertical displacement, consistent with a vertical wave propagating towards the outer parts of the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Nova contributions to the chemical evolution of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The explosive burning that drives nova eruptions results in unique nucleosynthesis that heavily over-produces certain isotopes relative to the solar abundance. However, novae are often ignored when considering the chemical evolution of our Galaxy due to their low ejecta masses. Aims. In this work, we use previously computed synthetic nova populations and the galactic chemical evolution code OMEGA+ to assess the impact that novae have on the evolution of stable elemental and isotopic abundances. Methods. We combine populations of novae computed using the binary population synthesis code binary_c with the galactic chemical evolution code OMEGA+ and detailed, white dwarf mass-dependent nova yields to model the nucleosynthetic contributions of novae to the evolution of the Milky Way. We consider three different nova yield profiles, each corresponding to a different set of nova yield calculations. Results. Despite novae from low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) dominating nova ejecta contributions, we find that novae occurring on massive WDs are still able to contribute significantly to many isotopes, particularly those with high mass numbers. We find that novae can produce up to 35% of the Galactic 13C and 15N mass by the time the model Galaxy reaches [Fe/H] = 0, and earlier in the evolution of the Galaxy (between [Fe/H] = -2 and -1) novae may have been the dominant source of 15N. Predictions for [13C/Fe], [15N/Fe], 12C/13C, and 14N/15N abundances ratios vary by up to 0.2 dex at [Fe/H] = 0 and by up to 0.7 dex in [15N/Fe] and 14N/15N between [Fe/H] = -2 and -1 (corresponding approximately to Galactic ages of 170 Myr and 1 Gyr in our model). The Galactic evolution of other stable isotopes (excluding Li) is not noticeably affected by including novae.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XV: The core mass function in the high-mass star-formation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is critical to our understanding of star formation and the effects of young stars on their environment. On large scales, it enables us to use tracers such as UV or Halpha emission to estimate the star formation rate of a system and interpret unresolved star clusters across the universe. So far, there is little firm evidence of large-scale variations of the IMF, which is thus generally considered universal. Stars form from cores and it is now possible to estimate core masses and compare the core mass function (CMF) with the IMF, which it presumably produces. The goal of the ALMA-IMF large program is to measure the core mass function at high linear resolution (2700 au) in 15 typical Milky Way protoclusters spanning a mass range of 2500 to 32700 Msun. In this work, we used two different core extraction algorithms to extract about 680 gravitationally bound cores from these 15 protoclusters. We adopt per core temperature using the temperature estimate from the PPMAP Bayesian method. A power-law fit to the CMF of the sub-sample of cores above the 1.64 Msun completeness limit, 330 cores, through the maximum likelihood estimate technique yields a slope of 1.97 +/- 0.06, significantly flatter than the 2.35 Salpeter slope. Assuming a self-similar mapping between the CMF and the IMF, this result implies that these 15 high-mass protoclusters will generate atypical IMFs. This sample is the largest to date produced and analysed self-consistently, derived at matched physical resolution, with per-core temperature estimates and cores as massive as 150 Msun. We provide the raw source extraction catalogues and the source derived size, temperature, mass, and spectral indices in the 15 protoclusters.</description>

Abstract: Coupling between relativistic jets launched by accreting supermassive black holes and the surrounding gaseous media is a vital ingredient in galaxy evolution models. To constrain the environments in which this feedback takes place over cosmic time, we study the host halo properties of luminous low-frequency radio galaxies ($L_{150 \ \mathrm{MHz}} \gtrsim$ 25.25 W/Hz) selected with the International LOFAR Telescope out to $z \sim 2$ through tomographic clustering and cosmic microwave background lensing measurements. We find that these systems occupy halos characteristic of galaxy groups ($M_h = 10^{13} - 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$), evolving at a rate consistent with the mean growth rate of halos over the past $\sim$10 Gyr. The coevolution of the clustering and the luminosity function reveals that the duty cycle of these systems is of order $\sim 10\%$ but has been mildly increasing since $z\sim 2$, while the duty cycle of quasars has been declining. We estimate the characteristic kinetic heating power injected by powerful jets per halo as a function of mass, and compare to the same quantity injected by quasar winds. We find that powerful jet heating dominates over quasar winds in halos $M_h \gtrsim 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ at $z &lt; 2$. These results conform to the paradigm of galaxy evolution in which mechanical jet power feedback is the dominant heating mechanism of the gas content of groups and clusters.</description>

      <title>Witnessing an extreme, highly efficient galaxy formation mode with resolved Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J1316+2614 at z=3.613 is the UV-brightest ($M_{UV}$ = -24.7) and strongest Lyman continuum (LyC, $f_{esc}^{LyC} \approx$ 90%) emitting star-forming galaxy known, showing also signatures of inflowing gas from its blue-dominated Ly$\alpha$ profile. Here, we present high-resolution imaging with the HST and VLT of the LyC, Ly$\alpha$, rest-UV, and optical emission of J1316+2614. Detailed analysis of the LyC and UV light distributions reveals compact yet resolved profiles, with LyC and UV morphologies showing identical half-light radii of $\simeq$ 220 pc. The continuum-subtracted Ly$\alpha$ emission reveals an extended filamentary structure of $\simeq$ 6.0 kpc oriented south-north with only weak/residual flux within the stellar core, suggesting a Ly$\alpha$ "hole". J1316+2614 presents remarkably high SFR and stellar mass surface densities of log($\Sigma_{SFR}$ [$M_{\odot}$/yr/kpc^2]) = 3.47$\pm$0.11 and log($\Sigma_{M}$ [$M_{\odot}$/pc^2]) = 4.20$\pm$0.06, respectively, which are among the highest observed in star-forming galaxies. Our findings indicate that J1316+2614 is a powerful, young, and compact starburst, leaking significant LyC photons due to the lack of gas and dust within the starburst. We explore the conditions for gas expulsion using a simple energetic balance and find that, given the strong binding force in J1316+2614, a high star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{SF} \geq 0.7$) is necessary to remove the gas and explain its exposed nature. Our results thus suggest a close link between high $\epsilon_{SF}$ and high $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. This high efficiency can also naturally explain the remarkably high SFR, UV-luminosity, and efficient mass growth of J1316+2614, where at least 62% of its mass formed in the last 6 Myr. J1316+2614 may exemplify an intense, feedback-free starburst with a high $\epsilon_{SF}$, similar to those proposed for UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts. (ABRIDGED)</description>

      <title>The Chemical Diversity of the Metal-Poor Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the chemical diversity of the metal-poor Milky Way (MW) using data from the GALAH DR3 survey. Considering 17 chemical abundances relative to iron ([X/Fe]) for 9,923 stars, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Extreme Deconvolution (XD) to identify 10 distinct stellar groups. This approach, free from chemical or dynamical cuts, reveals known populations, including the accreted halo, thick disc, thin disc, and in-situ halo. The thick disc is characterised by multiple substructures, suggesting it comprises stars formed in diverse environments. Our findings highlight the limited discriminatory power of magnesium in separating accreted and disc stars. Elements such as Ba, Al, Cu, and Sc are critical in distinguishing disc from accreted stars, while Ba, Y, Eu and Zn differentiate disc and accreted stars from the in-situ halo. This study demonstrates the potential power of combining a latent space representation of the data (PCA) with a clustering algorithm (XD) in Galactic archaeology, in providing new insights into the galaxy's assembly and evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>The accreted Galaxy: An overview of TESS metal-poor accreted stars candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a mosaic of stars from different origins. In particular, metal-poor accreted star candidates offer a unique opportunity to better understand the accretion history of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to explore the assembly history of the Milky Way by investigating accreted stars in terms of their ages, dynamical properties, and chemical abundances. We also aim to better characterize the impact of incorporating asteroseismic information on age and chemical abundance calculations of metal-poor accreted stars for which TESS data is available. In this study, we conducted an in-depth examination of 30 metal-poor accreted star candidates, using TESS and Gaia data, as well as MIKE spectra. We find satisfactory agreement between seismic and predicted/spectroscopic surface gravity (log g) values, demonstrating the reliability of spectroscopic data from our methodology. We found that while age determination is highly dependent on the log g and asteroseismic information used, the overall chemical abundance distributions are similar for different log g. However, we found that calcium (Ca) abundances are more sensitive to the adopted log g. Our study reveals that the majority of our stars have properties compatible to those reported for the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, with a minority of stars that might be associated to Splash. We found an age distribution with a median of 11.3 Gyr with lower and upper uncertainties of 4.1 and 1.3 Gyr respectively when including asteroseismic information. As regarding some key chemical signatures we note that these stars are metal-poor ([Fe/H]) &lt; -0.8), alpha-rich ([alpha]/Fe] &gt; 0.2), copper-poor ([Cu/Fe] &lt; 0 ) and with chemical abundances typical of accreted stars. These findings illustrate the importance of multi-dimensional analyses in unraveling the complex accretion history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The comparison of an optical and X-ray counterpart of subparsec supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study and compare the optical and X-ray counterparts of subparsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). With that aim, we simulated the profiles of optical spectral lines emitted from the broad line region (BLR) as well as X-ray spectral lines emitted from the relativistic accretion disks around both black holes and compared them with each other. The obtained results showed that SMBHBs could cause a specific, but different variability of the lines from the optical part and Fe K$\alpha$ line, leaving potentially detectable imprints in their profiles. Since these imprints depend on the orbital phase of the system, they could be used for reconstructing the Keplerian orbits of the components in the observed SMBHBs. Moreover, such signatures in the optical and X-ray line profiles of the observed SMBHBs could be used as a tool for the detection of these objects as well as for studying their properties.</description>

      <title>Validating the clustering predictions of empirical models with the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Mock galaxy catalogues are essential for correctly interpreting current and future generations of galaxy surveys. Despite their significance in galaxy formation and cosmology, little to no work has been done to validate the predictions of these mocks for high-order clustering statistics.
  Aims. We compare the predicting power of the latest generation of empirical models used in the creation of mock galaxy catalogues: a 13-parameter Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and an extension of the SubHalo Abundance Matching technique (SHAMe).
  Methods. We build GalaxyEmu-Planck, an emulator that makes precise predictions for the two-point correlation function, galaxy-galaxy lensing (restricted to distances greater than 1 $h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ to avoid baryonic effects), and other high-order statistics resulting from the evaluation of SHAMe and HOD models.
  Results. We evaluate the precision of GalaxyEmu-Planck using two galaxy samples extracted from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation that mimic the properties of DESI-BGS and BOSS galaxies, finding that the emulator reproduces all the predicted statistics precisely. The HOD showed comparable performance when fitting galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. In contrast, the SHAMe model showed better predictions for higher-order statistics, especially regarding the galaxy assembly bias. We also tested the performance of the models after removing some of their extensions, finding that we can withdraw two of the HOD parameters without a loss of performance.
  Conclusions. The results of this paper validate the current generation of empirical models as a way to reproduce galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and other high-order statistics. The excellent performance of the SHAMe model with a small number of free parameters suggests that it is a valid method to extract cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>The First Billion Years in Seconds: An Effective Model for the 21-cm Signal with Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the 21-cm signal are opening a window to the cosmic-dawn epoch, when the first stars formed. These observations are usually interpreted with semi-numerical or hydrodynamical simulations, which are often computationally intensive and inflexible to changes in cosmological or astrophysical effects. Here, we present an effective, fully analytic model for the impact of the first stars on the 21-cm signal, using the modular code Zeus21. Zeus21 employs an analytic prescription of the star formation rate density (SFRD) to recover the fully nonlinear and nonlocal correlations of radiative fields that determine the 21-cm signal. We introduce the earliest Population III (Pop III) stars residing in low-mass molecular-cooling galaxies in Zeus21, with distinct spectra from later Pop II stars. We also self-consistently model feedback in the form of $H_2$-dissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, as well as dark matter-baryon relative velocities, both of which suppress star formation in the lowest-mass halos. LW feedback produces a scale-dependence on the SFRD fluctuations, due to the long mean free path of LW photons. Relative velocities give rise to "wiggles" in the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal; we present an improved calculation of the shape of these velocity-induced acoustic oscillations, showing they remain a standard ruler at cosmic dawn. Our improved version of Zeus21 predicts the 21-cm global signal and power spectra in agreement with simulations at the $\sim 10\%$ level, yet is at least three orders of magnitude faster. This public code represents a step towards efficient and flexible parameter inference at cosmic dawn, allowing us to predict the first billion years of the universe in mere seconds.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}\textrm{--}10^1\right)$\,s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}\textrm{--}10^{-19}\right)$\,eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}\textrm{--}10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Accurate, Precise, and Physically Self-consistent Ages and Metallicities for 400,000 Solar Neighborhood Subgiant Branch Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age is the most difficult fundamental stellar parameter to infer for isolated stars. While isochrone-based ages are in general imprecise for both main sequence dwarfs and red giants, precise isochrone-based ages can be obtained for stars on the subgiant branch transitioning from core to shell hydrogen burning. We synthesize Gaia DR3-based distance inferences, multiwavelength photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid infrared, and three-dimensional extinction maps to construct a sample of 289,759 solar-metallicity stars amenable to accurate, precise, and physically self-consistent age inferences. Using subgiants in the solar-metallicity open clusters NGC 2682 (i.e., M 67) and NGC 188, we show that our approach yields accurate and physically self-consistent ages and metallicities with median statistical precisions of 8\% and 0.06 dex. The inclusion of systematic uncertainties resulting from non-single or variable stars results in age and metallicity precisions of 9\% and 0.12 dex. We supplement this solar-metallicity sample with an additional 112,062 metal-poor subgiants, including over 3,000 stars with $[\text{Fe/H}]\lesssim-1.50$, 7\% age precisions, and apparent Gaia $G$-band magnitudes $G&lt;14$. We further demonstrate that our inferred metallicities agree with those produced by multiplexed spectroscopic surveys. As an example of the scientific potential of this catalog, we show that the solar neighborhood star-formation history has three components at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr}) \approx (+0.0,4)$, $(+0.2,7)$, and a roughly linear sequence in age--metallicity space beginning at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr})\approx(+0.2,7)$ and extending to $(-0.5,13)$. Our analyses indicate that the solar neighborhood includes stars on disk-like orbits even at the oldest ages and lowest metallicities accessible by our samples.</description>

      <title>Stirring the cosmic pot: how black hole feedback shapes the matter power spectrum in the Fable simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic physics on cosmic structure formation is crucial for accurate cosmological predictions, especially as we usher in the era of large galaxy surveys with the Rubin Observatory as well as the Euclid and Roman Space Telescopes. A key process that can redistribute matter across a large range of scales is feedback from accreting supermassive black holes. How exactly these active galactic nuclei (AGN) operate from sub-parsec to Mega-parsec scales however remains largely unknown. To understand this, we investigate how different AGN feedback models in the Fable simulation suite affect the cosmic evolution of the matter power spectrum (MPS).
  Our analysis reveals that AGN feedback significantly suppresses clustering at scales $k \sim 10\,h\,cMpc^{-1}$, with the strongest effect at redshift $z = 0$ causing a reduction of $\sim 10\%$ with respect to the dark matter-only simulation. This is due to the efficient feedback in both radio (low Eddington ratio) and quasar (high Eddington ratio) modes in our fiducial Fable model. We find that variations of the quasar and radio mode feedback with respect to the fiducial Fable model have distinct effects on the MPS redshift evolution, with the radio mode being more effective on larger scales and later epochs. Furthermore, MPS suppression is dominated by AGN feedback effects inside haloes at $z = 0$, while for $z \gtrsim 1$ the matter distribution both inside and outside of haloes shapes the MPS suppression. Hence, future observations probing earlier cosmic times beyond $z \sim 1$ will be instrumental in constraining the nature of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Mapping the distribution of the magnetic field strength along the NGC 315 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic field strengths along the jet in NGC~315. First, we estimated the angular velocity of rotation in the jet magnetosphere by comparing the measured velocity profile of NGC~315 with the magneto-hydrodynamic jet model of proposed by Tomimatsu and Takahashi. Similar to the case of M87, we find that the model can reproduce the logarithmic feature of the velocity profile and suggest a slowly rotating black hole magnetosphere for NGC~315. By substituting the estimated $\Omega_{F}$ into the jet power predicted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, we estimate the magnetic field strength near the event horizon of the central black hole as $5\times 10^{3}~{\rm G}\lesssim B_{H}\lesssim 2\times 10^{4}~{\rm G}$. We then estimate magnetic-field strengths along the jet by comparing the spectral index distribution obtained from VLBI observations with a synchrotron-emitting jet model. Then we constrain the magnetic field strength at a de-projected distance $z$ from the black hole to be in the range $0.06~{\rm G}\lesssim B(z)\lesssim 0.9~{\rm G}$ for $5.2 \times 10^{3}~r_{g}\lesssim z \lesssim 4.9 \times 10^{4}~r_{g}$, where $r_{g}$ represents the gravitational radius. By combining the obtained field strengths at the event horizon and the downstream section of the jet, we find that the accretion flow at the jet base is consistent with a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). We discuss a comparison of the jet power and the magnetic flux anchored to the event horizon in NGC~315 and M87.</description>

      <title>First deep X-ray observations of the Fermi-detected steep-spectrum source and radio-loud NLS1 galaxy 3C 286</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known calibrator source in radio astronomy, 3C 286 ($z=0.85$), is a compact steep-spectrum (CSS) radio source and spectroscopically classified as a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy. It is also known for its damped Ly$\alpha$ system from an intervening galaxy at $z=0.692$ detected in both ultraviolet (UV) and radio spectra. In addition, despite being a misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN), 3C 286 is also detected in $\gamma$-rays by Fermi. Thus, this unique object combines the characteristics of CSS sources, NLS1 galaxies, and $\gamma$-ray emitters with misaligned jets, providing an excellent laboratory for extending our knowledge of AGN disk-jet coupling. Despite its significance, 3C 286 has been rarely observed in X-rays. In this study, we present our deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of 3C 286. The results reveal that the X-ray spectrum can be well described by models including an intervening absorber with redshift and column density consistent with previous UV and radio observations. The most important finding is that the spectrum cannot be described by a single power law, but a soft excess is required which is parameterized by a blackbody. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting the presence of off-nuclear X-ray emission at a radius that corresponds to the location of the radio lobes. While further theoretical work is still needed, our findings offer new clues to understand the specific mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission from this unique object.</description>

      <title>Accretion properties of soft X-ray transient XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft X-ray transients are a subclass of the low mass X-ray binaries that occasionally show a sudden rise in their soft X-ray luminosity; otherwise, they remain in an extremely faint state. We investigate the accretion properties of the soft X-ray transient XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by NICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral density shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source's spectrum on July 19 can be well-fitted with a multi-color blackbody component, a power-law component, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line. NICER spectra can be well-fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody and a power-law. The source exhibits a transition within just five days from a soft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The inner accretion disk has a low inclination angle ($\sim18^\circ$). The spectral analysis also suggests a high-spin ($a&gt;0.9$) BH as the central accreting object.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing, such as in shocks. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on more challenging cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This validates our methods for use-cases relevant across applications spanning astrophysics and engineering, where particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales, or where emergent and evolving density discontinuities cannot easily be corrected by choosing bespoke particle masses in the initial conditions. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art \swift code and is designed with computational efficiency in mind, which means that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without significant cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>HII galaxies as standard candles: evolutionary corrections</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade the relation between the Balmer-line luminosity of HII galaxies and the velocity width of the emission lines, the L - {\sigma} relation, has been painstakingly calibrated as a cosmological distance indicator with seemingly spectacular results: the Hubble constant and the energy-density of dark energy obtained using the L-{\sigma} indicator agree remarkably well with the values from canonical indicators. Since most of the luminosity of these young compact starburst galaxies is emitted by a few narrow emission-lines, they can be observed with good precision up redshifts z ~ 7 with JWST, making the L - {\sigma} indicator a potentially unique cosmological probe. However, the precision of the method remains too low to effectively constrain the relevant cosmological parameters, notably the equation of state of dark energy. The scatter of the L - {\sigma} relation is significantly larger than the random observational errors so we do not have a good handle on the systematics of the method. In a previous paper we posited that since the ionizing radiation of these young galaxies fades rapidly over time-scales of only a few million years, age differences could be the main underlying cause of the scatter. In this paper we explore several different ways to explain the scatter of the correlation, but without success. We show that the majority of HII galaxies are powered by multiple starbursts of slightly different ages, and therefore that the equivalent widths are not reliable chronometers to correct the luminosities for evolution. Thus, it is not likely that the accuracy of the L - {\sigma} distance indicator can be improved in the near future. Since we do not fully understand neither the systematics nor the underlying physics of the L - {\sigma} relation, using large samples of distant HII galaxies may or may not improve the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretable analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, a large number of G, K, and M giants are also distributed in the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Their spectra have differences,especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Aims. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using Gaia's XP spectra, while providing attribution explanations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Methods. We proposed a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling Gaia's XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to calculate the SHAP value for each feature point in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis Results. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy even reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP algorithm, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed mainly around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five crucial feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of the Gaia Milky Way declining rotation curve</title>

Abstract: Although the existence of dark matter has been widely acknowledged in the cosmology community, it is as yet unknown in nature, despite decades of research, which questions its very existence. This never-ending search for dark matter leads to consider alternatives. Since increasing the enclosed mass is the only way to explain the flat appearance of galaxies rotation curves in a Newtonian framework, the MOND theory proposed to modify Newton's dynamics when the acceleration is around or below a threshold value, a_0. Observed rotation curves, generally flat at large distances, are then usually well reproduced by MOND with a_0 ~ 1.2 10^{-10} m/s^2. However, the recent Gaia evidence of a decline in the Milky Way rotation curve is a distinct behavior. Therefore, we examine whether LCDM and MOND can accommodate the Gaia declining rotation curve of the Milky Way. We first depict a standard model to describe the Milky Way's baryonic components. Secondly, we show that a NFW model is able to fit the decline, assuming a scale radius R_s of the order of 4 kpc. In a third step, we show that the usual MOND paradigm is not able to reproduce the declining part for a standard baryonic model. Finally, we examine whether the MOND theory can accommodate the declining part of the rotation curve when relaxing the characteristics of the baryonic components. To do so we use a MCMC method on the characteristics of the stellar and the HI disk, including their mass. We found that the stellar disk should be massive, of the order of 10^{11} M_\odot. The HI disk mass is capped at nearly 1.8 10^{11} M_\odot but could also be negligible. Finally, a_0 is consistent with 0, with an upper limit of 0.53 10^{-10} m/s^{2} (95\%), a value much lower than the above mentioned value usually advocated to explain standard flat rotation curves in MOND theory.</description>

      <title>Identification of High-Redshift Galaxy Overdensities in GOODS-N and GOODS-S</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities at $4.9 &lt; z_{\,\mathrm{spec}} &lt; 8.9$ in both the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS in addition to JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. High-redshift galaxy candidates are identified using HST+JWST photometry spanning $\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. We confirmed the redshifts for roughly a third of these galaxies using JWST/FRESCO spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.9-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ through identification of either $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ or $\left[\mathrm{OIII}\right]\lambda5008$ around the best-fit photometric redshift. The rest-UV magnitudes and continuum slopes of these galaxies were inferred from the photometry: the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. We find $17$ significant ($\delta_{\mathrm{gal}} \geq 3.04$, $N_{\mathrm{galaxies}} \geq 4$) galaxy overdensities across both fields ($7$ in GOODS-N and $10$ in GOODS-S), including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at $\left&lt; z_{\mathrm{\,spec}} \right&gt; = 7.954$ and $\left&lt; z_{\mathrm{\,spec}} \right&gt; = 8.222$ (representing densities around $\sim 6$ and $\sim 12$ times that of a random volume). We estimate the total halo mass of these large-scale structures to be $11.5 \leq \mathrm{log}_{10}\left(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}\right) \leq 13.4$ using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, which are likely underestimates as a result of incompleteness. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with $\mathrm{log}_{10}\left(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}\right) \gtrsim 14$ by $z = 0$.</description>

      <title>JWST UNCOVER: The Overabundance of Ultraviolet-luminous Galaxies at $z&gt;9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking distances up to $z \sim 13$. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the epoch of reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over $\sim 45$ arcmin$^{2}$ down to $\sim 29.5$ AB mag. Here, we present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived through lensing clusters at $9&lt;z&lt;12$. Using comprehensive end-to-end simulations, we account for all lensing effects and systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies ($M_{UV} &lt; -20$ AB mag) previously reported at $z&gt;9$ in recent JWST studies. In particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical Schechter form. The number density of these bright galaxies is 10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions and previous findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of $\rho_{\rm SFR} = 10^{-2.64}$ M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-3}$ at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than galaxy formation models that assume a constant star formation efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of lensing-assisted observations will reliably constrain both the bright and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at $z&gt;9$, which will provide key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of the dust size evolution in isolated galaxy simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to provide observational signatures of the dust size evolution in the ISM. In particular, we explore indicators of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mass fraction ($q_{PAH}$), defined as the mass fraction of PAHs relative to total dust grains. In addition, we validate our dust evolution model by comparing the observational signatures from our simulations to observations. We used the hydrodynamic simulation code, GADGET4-OSAKA to model the dust properties of Milky Way-like and NGC 628-like galaxies representing star-forming galaxies. This code incorporates the evolution of grain size distributions driven by dust production and interstellar processing. Furthermore, we performed post-processing dust radiative transfer with SKIRT based on the simulations to predict the observational properties. We find that the intensity ratio between 8 um and 24 um is correlated with $q_{PAH}$ and can be used as an indicator of PAH mass fraction. However, this ratio is influenced by the radiation field. We suggest the 8 um-to-total infrared intensity ratio ($\nu I_\nu(8 \mu m)/I$(TIR)) as another indicator, since it is tightly correlated with $q_{PAH}$. Furthermore, we explored the spatially resolved $q_{PAH}$ in the simulated Milky Way-like galaxy using $\nu I_\nu(8 \mu m)/I$(TIR). We find that the spatially resolved $q_{PAH}$ increases with metallicity at metallicity at Z&lt;0.2 Zsun due to the interplay between accretion and shattering while it decreases at Z&gt;0.2 Zsun because of coagulation. Finally, we compared the above indicators in the NGC 628-like simulation with those observed in NGC 628 by recent observations. Consequently, we find that our simulation underestimates the PAH mass fraction throughout the entire galaxy by a factor of $\sim 8$ on average. This could be due to the efficient loss of PAHs by coagulation in our model.</description>

      <title>The Effect of AGN Feedback on the Lyman-{\alpha} Forest Signature of Galaxy Protoclusters at z~2.3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) in the vicinity of galaxy protoclusters are interesting testbeds to study complex baryonic effects such as gravitational shocks and feedback. Here, we utilize hydrodynamical simulations from the SIMBA and The Three Hundred suites to study the mechanisms influencing large-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission in $2&lt;z&lt;2.5$ protoclusters. We focus on the matter overdensity-Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission relation $(\delta_m-\delta_F)$ on Megaparsec-scales in these protoclusters, which is hypothesized to be sensitive to the feedback implementations. The lower-density regions represented by the SIMBA-100 cosmological volume trace the power-law $\delta_m-\delta_F$ relationship often known as the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation. This trend is continued into higher-density regions covered by simulations that implement stellar feedback only. Simulations with AGN thermal and AGN jet feedback , however, exhibit progressively more Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission at fixed matter overdensity. Compared with the 7 protoclusters observed in the COSMOS field, only 2 display the excess absorption expected from protoclusters. The others exhibit deviations: 4 show some increased transparency suggested by AGN X-ray thermal feedback models while the highly transparent COSTCO-I protocluster appears to reflect intense jet feedback. Discrepancies with the stellar-feedback-only model suggests processes at play beyond gravitational heating and/or stellar feedback as the cause of the protocluster transparencies. Some form of AGN feedback is likely at play in the observed protoclusters, and possibly long-ranged AGN jets in the case of COSTCO-I. While more detailed and resolved simulations are required to move forward, our findings open new avenues for probing AGN feedback at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic characterisation of gravitationally lensed stars at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep imaging of galaxy cluster fields have in recent years revealed tens of candidates for gravitationally lensed stars at redshifts $z\approx$ 1-6, and future searches are expected to reveal highly magnified stars from even earlier epochs. Multi-band photometric observations may be used to constrain the redshift, effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and dust attenuation along the line of sight to such objects. When combined with an estimate of the likely magnification, these quantities may be converted into a constraint on the stellar luminosity and, for an adopted set of stellar evolutionary tracks, the initial stellar mass. Further characterization is, however, difficult without spectroscopic observations, which at the typical brightness levels of high-redshift lensed stars becomes extremely challenging for even the largest existing telescopes. Here, we explore what spectral features one can realistically hope to detect in lensed stars with peak brightness in the range 26-28 AB mag, $T_\mathrm{eff}=$ 4000-50 000 K and redshifts $z=$1-10, using spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope. We find that a majority of detectable lines appear in the rest UV-range for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}\geq$15 000 K. The strongest detectable spectral lines are the C IV $\lambda$ 1550 \r{A} line and the Si IV $\lambda\lambda$1393, 1403 \r{A}-doublet at $T_\mathrm{eff}=$30 000 K. For lower temperatures, the calcium H- and K-lines at $T_\mathrm{eff}=$6000 K are among the most readily detectable. In limited wavelength ranges, ELT is expected to provide more sensitive spectroscopic observations, and with higher resolution than JWST. We find that variations of both mass loss rate and metallicity lead to noticeable effects in the detectability of certain spectral lines with both JWST and ELT.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>

Abstract: We present the third Data Release (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. IV. The Star Formation Properties of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>

Abstract: We present the star-forming properties of 378 satellite galaxies around 101 Milky Way analogs in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, focusing on the environmental processes that suppress or quench star formation. In the SAGA stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses, we present quenched fractions, star-forming rates, gas-phase metallicities, and gas content. The fraction of SAGA satellites that are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass and shows significant system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellite quenched fractions are highest in the central 100 kpc of their hosts and decline out to the virial radius. Splitting by specific star formation rate (sSFR), the least star-forming satellite quartile follows the radial trend of the quenched population. The median sSFR of star-forming satellites increases with decreasing stellar mass and is roughly constant with projected radius. Star-forming SAGA satellites are consistent with the star formation rate--stellar mass relationship determined in the Local Volume, while the median gas-phase metallicity is higher and median HI gas mass is lower at all stellar masses. We investigate the dependence of the satellite quenched fraction on host properties. Quenched fractions are higher in systems with larger host halo mass, but this trend is only seen in the inner 100 kpc; we do not see significant trends with host color or star formation rate. Our results suggest that lower mass satellites and satellites inside 100 kpc are more efficiently quenched in a Milky Way-like environment, with these processes acting sufficiently slowly to preserve a population of star-forming satellites at all stellar masses and projected radii.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>Structure and Kinematics of Star-forming Elliptical Galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 'spatially' resolved spectroscopy, we investigated the characteristics and different modes of formation of stars in elliptical galaxies. We identified an unusual population of 59 star-forming elliptical (SF-E) galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA, our primary sample. To identify these rare star-forming ellipticals, we combined GSWLC-A2 containing outputs of stellar population synthesis models with morphological results from the deep-learning catalog and resolved and integrated properties from the MaNGA Pipe3D value-added catalog. We have also constructed two control samples of star-forming spirals (SF-Sps; 2419 galaxies) and quenched ellipticals (Q-Es; 684 galaxies) to compare with our primary sample of SF-Es. H$\alpha$ emission line flux of SF-Es is similar to spiral galaxies. The D4000 spectral index indicates that SF-Es have a mixture of old and young stellar populations. Mass-weighted stellar age and metallicity for the SF-Es are lower than the Q-Es and 67\% of stellar- and gas- velocity maps of the primary sample show signs of kinematic disturbance. All of these indicate that SF-Es have acquired metal-poor gas through recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies and are forming a new generation of stars. Further, we subdivide our primary sample of SF-Es into four classes based on their bulge to total luminosity ratio $(B/T)$ and spin parameter $\lambda_{re}$. These four classes have their distinct evolutionary history and modes of formation. Based on these results, we suggest that the Hubble diagram does not accurately capture galaxy evolution processes, and we need a revised morphology diagram like the comb morphology diagram to get a complete picture of the galaxy evolution processes.</description>

      <title>DESI Early Data Release Milky Way Survey Value-Added Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the stellar value-added catalogue based on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. The catalogue contains radial velocity and stellar parameter measurements for $\simeq$ 400,000 unique stars observed during commissioning and survey validation by DESI. These observations were made under conditions similar to the Milky Way Survey (MWS) currently carried out by DESI but also include multiple specially targeted fields, such as those containing well-studied dwarf galaxies and stellar streams. The majority of observed stars have $16&lt;r&lt;20$ with a median signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of $\sim$ 20. In the paper, we describe the structure of the catalogue, give an overview of different target classes observed, as well as provide recipes for selecting clean stellar samples. We validate the catalogue using external high-resolution measurements and show that radial velocities, surface gravities, and iron abundances determined by DESI are accurate to 1 km/s, $0.3$ dex and $\sim$ 0.15 dex respectively. We also demonstrate possible uses of the catalogue for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way stellar halo and Draco dwarf spheroidal. The value-added catalogue described in this paper is the very first DESI MWS catalogue. The next DESI data release, expected in less than a year, will add the data from the first year of DESI survey operations and will contain approximately 4 million stars, along with significant processing improvements.</description>

      <title>Detection of maser emission at 183 and 380 GHz with ALMA in the gigamaser galaxy TXS2226-184</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abridged. The LINER galaxy TXS2226-184 is known to host a very luminous 22 GHz water maser, called a gigamaser at the time of its discovery. To date, the nature of this maser is still being debated, in particular, whether it is associated with a nuclear accretion disk or with an ejection component, namely a jet or an outflow originating in the active galactic nucleus. We obtained multi-band (bands 5, 6, and 7) ALMA observations during Cycle 9, with the purpose of investigating the maser nature and the nuclear molecular material in the innermost region of the galaxy. While the full data sets are still under study, a preliminary data reduction and analysis of the band 5 and 7 spectral line cubes presented in this Letter already offer a significant outcome. We observed bright, possibly maser emission from the water 183 GHz and 380 GHz transitions in TXS2226. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first unambiguous detection (S/N &gt;= 100) of 380 GHz maser emission in a known 22-GHz maser galaxy, and the first case where all three transitions are present in the same object. Emission features at both frequencies show a two-peaked line profile resembling that of the 22 GHz maser features. The mm/submm emission originates from a region coincident, within the errors, with that of the 22 GHz. The similarities in profile and position indicate that the emission at the three frequencies is likely produced by the same nuclear structure, although differences in line strengths and feature peak positions may hint at a slightly different physical conditions of the emitting gas. A comparison with the few megamaser sources studied at high enough detail and sharing similarities with the water lines in TXS2226 favors a nature associated with the amplification of a bright nuclear continuum (from a jet or outflow) through dense and hot gas in front of the nucleus (e.g., a disk or torus)...</description>

      <title>Studying the Kinematics of the Stellar Association TW Hya from Modern Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume expansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient $K_{xyz}=103\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time interval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\pm1.1$ Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined: $\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Applying Simulation-Based Inference to Spectral and Spatial Information from the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>Resolution analysis of magnetically arrested disk simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarisation measurements by the Event Horizon Telescope from M87$^{\ast}$ and Sgr A$^\ast$ suggest that there is a dynamically strong, ordered magnetic field, typical of what is expected of a magnetically arrested accretion disk (MAD). In such disks the strong poloidal magnetic field can suppress the accretion flow and cause episodic flux eruptions. Recent work shows that General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) MAD simulations feature dynamics of turbulence and mixing instabilities that are becoming resolved at higher resolutions. We perform a convergence study of MAD states exceeding the status quo by an order of magnitude in resolution. We use existing 3D simulations performed with the H-AMR code, up to resolution of 5376 x 2304 x 2304 in a logarithmic spherical-polar grid. We find consistent time-averaged disk properties across all resolutions. However, higher resolutions reveal signs of inward angular momentum transport attributed to turbulent convection, particularly evident when mixing instabilities occur at the surfaces of flux tubes during flux eruptions. Additionally, we see wave-like features in the jet sheath, which become more prominent at higher resolutions, that may induce mixing between jet and disk. At higher resolutions, we observe the sheath to be thinner, resulting in increased temperature, reduced magnetisation, and greater variability. Those differences could affect the dissipation of energy, that would eventually result in distinct observable radiative emission from high-resolution simulations. With higher resolutions, we can delve into crucial questions about horizon-scale physics and its impact on the dynamics and emission properties of larger-scale jets.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>
