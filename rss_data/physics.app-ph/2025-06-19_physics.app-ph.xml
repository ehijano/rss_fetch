      <title>Coupled micro-resonators for second-order integrated nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate second-order nonlinear processes in a system of two coupled identical optical micro-resonators. The double resonance and phase-matching conditions are simultaneously obtained thanks to the frequency splitting induced by the resonator coupling. The analysis made in the framework of the coupled mode theory is applied to the second harmonic generation process in two whispering gallery mode microdisks made in III-V materials.</description>

      <title>Integrated microheater on the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI) platform has resulted in the demonstration of essential building blocks such as low-loss waveguides and microresonators. In this work, we add tunability to the 4H-SiCOI platform by integrating microheaters with compact microresonators. The strong thermo-optic effect in SiC enables a resonance tuning rate of $11.7$ pm/mW for a 36-$\mu$m-radius SiC microring, with a maximum wavelength shift up to $2.4$ nm (300 GHz). The thermal time constant of the microheater is estimated near 7 $\mu$s, corresponding to a 3-dB electrical bandwidth of 40 kHz. As a demonstration of potential applications, we employ the microheater to perform fast thermo-optic scans to deterministically access the single-soliton state of a 36-$\mu$m-radius microcomb source. In addition, an add-drop filter based on an over-coupled 18-$\mu$m-radius SiC microring is combined with the microcomb source for the selective filtering of individual comb lines, featuring an approximate 3-dB bandwidth of 5 GHz and an insertion loss of less than 1 dB. With such demonstrations, our work brings the much-needed tunability and reconfigurability to the 4H-SiCOI platform, paving the way for a wealth of chip-scale applications.</description>

      <title>First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting Layer Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold Swing Behavior in Amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide Transistors from Room to Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While cryogenic-temperature subthreshold swing (SS) in crystalline semiconductors has been widely studied, a careful study on the temperature-dependent SS in amorphous oxide semiconductors remains lacking. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the SS in thin-film transistors with an amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel at temperatures from 300 K down to 4 K is presented. Main observations include: 1) At room temperature (300 K), the devices exhibit a SS of 61 mV/dec, and a low interface trap density (&lt;1011 cm-2), among the best reported values for IGZO devices. 2) A SS saturation around 40 mV/dec is observed between 200 K and 100 K. It is well explained by the electron transport via band tail states with exponential decay (Wt) of 13 meV. 3) At deep-cryogenic temperature, SS increase significantly exceeding 200 mV/dec at 4 K. Such high SS values are actually limited by the measurement current range, confirmed by Id-Vg simulations based on the variable range hopping (VRH) model. This work not only elucidates the SS behavior in amorphous IGZO devices but also provides a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms of electron transport in amorphous semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-resistivity nitrogen-doped p-type Cu2O thin films fabricated by reactive HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the nitrogen-doped cuprous oxide thin films on the amorphous standard soda-lime glass by reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. The energy of film-forming particles was controlled by the value of pulse-averaged target power density, which has a significant impact on the elemental composition, structure and optoelectrical properties of the films. We have shown that the high-energy regime is more suitable for preserving Cu2O structure and leads to continuous substitution of oxygen by nitrogen compared with the low-energy regime. Moreover, in the high-energy regime, it is possible, to some extent, to independently control the electrical resistivity and optical properties. The electrical resistivity decreases down to 5 x10-2 ohm.cm at the optical band gap 2.0-2.3 eV. Special attention is paid to the formation of nitrogen molecules and their ability to form shallow acceptor states. Experimental results supported by our DFT calculations indicate that N2 replacing Cu in the Cu2O lattice is one possible (but not the only possible) acceptor. We have also found that the formation of nitrogen molecules is preferred in a high-energy regime.</description>

      <title>An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing of malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing is developed and studied in this work. The model is applied to a reference sensor made from a plasmonic metasurface comprised of an array of nanoholes 150 nm in diameter patterned in a 150 nm thick gold film. The sensor is functionalized to detect plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a malaria biomarker. The biochemistry above the sensor's metasurface is modelled as stacks of closely packed adlayers. Using the Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory we link the refractive index of the pLDH biomarker adsorbed layer to the bulk concentration of the biomarker in the buffer. The effective microscopic model we then develop accounts for the combined optical properties of the biochemistry matrix, bound pLDH, and the buffer medium. By simulating the sensor using the finite element method and an approximate analytical method, the effective model allows us to determine the sensor response, predict binding interactions, and quantify concentration changes on the sensor surface. We calculate the sensor sensitivity for the reference sensor and the theoretical limit of detection (LOD) based on spectral and transmission sensing interrogation. The lowest LOD calculated based on the model is 0.02 nM of pLDH, equivalent to 0.70 ng/mL. The effective model is quite general and could be applied to other types of plasmonic biosensors and biomarkers of different diseases. It may therefore aid in the design of new optical biosensors with improved performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient, inverse gigavoxel-scale optimization of diffractive lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable photonic optimization holds the promise of significantly enhancing the performance of diffractive lenses across a wide range of photonic applications. However, the high computational cost of conventional electromagnetic solvers has thus far limited design domains to only a few tens of micrometers. Here, we overcome this limitation by integrating the convergent Born series with the adjoint-field optimization framework, enabling inverse design over a $110 \times 110 \times 46\ \mu\text{m}^3$ volume$-$corresponding to 1.01 gigavoxels$-$using a single, cost-effective graphics card. The optimized lens achieves a 9% improvement in axial resolution and a 20% increase in focusing efficiency compared to a standard Fresnel lens of identical diameter and numerical aperture. These gains point to immediate application opportunities for optimizing high-performance microscopy, photolithography, and optical trapping systems using modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>XDoppler axial velocity estimation using row-column arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate volumetric velocity estimation in ultrasound imaging is crucial for applications in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Traditional ultrasound systems, while effective in two-dimensional imaging, face significant challenges in achieving 3D imaging due to hardware and computational demands. Row-column addressed (RCA) ultrasound probes present a promising alternative, reducing hardware complexity, thus contributing to bridge the gap between research and clinical systems. Yet, this usually comes at the cost of lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced sensitivity and stronger sidelobes compared to 3D matrices, even though recent methods have tried to tackle the later issue. In this study, we introduce a method to use the phase of the signals acquired by rows and columns of RCA arrays to compute a new velocity estimator based on cross correlation of orthogonal apertures, extending the XDoppler scheme initially introduced for power Doppler imaging to the estimation of velocities. Our results indicate that XDoppler estimator can measure faithfully axial velocities (RMSE=9.21%, R2=0.88) and outperforms the traditional phase shift autocorrelator with a theoretical Nyquist velocity twice higher. Moreover, the in vitro data indicate a better sensitivity to flow velocities below 10mm/s and a lower bias for flow rate estimation (-0.17mL/min as opposed to -9.33mL/min for reference method). In vivo data acquired on a carotid artery confirm the reduced sensitivity to aliasing effects and show that this new technique can dynamically follow blood velocity evolutions linked to arterial pulsatility. This suggests that this new estimator could be of use for improved volumetric blood velocity imaging with a RCA probe.</description>

      <title>Near-field optical mode engineering-enabled freeform nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonic technologies inherently rely on tailoring light-matter interactions through the excitation and interference of deeply confined optical resonances. However, existing concepts in optical mode engineering remain heuristic and are challenging to extend towards complex and multi-functional resonant phenomena. Here, we introduce an inverse design framework that optimizes near-field distributions, ideally suited to tailor Mie-type modes within dielectric nanophotonic structures, and we demonstrate its powerful opportunities to facilitate the discovery of new classes of nonlocal metasurfaces. We show that freeform nonlocal metasurfaces supporting accidental bound states in the continuum can be readily optimized to tackle tailored illumination conditions, modal properties and quality factors. We further extend our approach to multifunctional and multipolar mode engineering, and experimentally demonstrate freeform planar nonlocal multi-wavelength and chiral metasurfaces. Our versatile and robust framework for freeform mode engineering has applications in a broad range of high quality-factor metasurface platforms relevant to sensing, nonlinear optics, optomechanics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study experimentally the impact of the additive fabrication method on the magnetic properties of Fe$^+$-implanted Pd square artificial spin ice lattices. Our findings show that the lattices exhibit a higher ordering temperature than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.</description>
