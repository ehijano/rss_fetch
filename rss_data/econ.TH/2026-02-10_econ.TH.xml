      <title>Prophet Inequalities via Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities bound the expected reward that can be obtained in a stopping problem by the optimal reward of its corresponding off-line version. We propose a systematic technique for deriving prophet inequalities for stopping problems associated with selecting a point in a polyhedron. It utilizes a reduced-form linear programming representation of the stopping problem. We illustrate the technique to derive a number of known results as well as some new ones. For instance, we prove a $\frac{1}{2}$-prophet inequality when the underlying polyhedron is an on-line polymatroid; one whose underlying submodular function depends upon the realized rewards. We also demonstrate a composition by the Minkowski sum property. If an $r-$ prophet inequality holds for polyhedra $P^1$ and $P^2$, it also holds for their Minkowski sum.</description>

      <title>Partially Identified Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of learning under ambiguity induced by the decision maker's beliefs about the collection of data correlated with the true state of the world. Within our framework, two classical results on Bayesian learning extend to the setting with ambiguity: experiments are equivalent to distributions over posterior beliefs, and Blackwell's more informative and more valuable orders coincide. When applied to the setting of robust Bayesian analysis, our results clarify the source of time inconsistency in the Gamma-minimax problem and provide an argument in favor of the conditional Gamma-minimax criterion. We also apply our results to a persuasion game to illustrate that our model provides a natural benchmark for communication under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Distributional Preferences for Market Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for incorporating distributional preferences in market design. We identify the structural properties of these preferences that guarantee the path independence of choice rules. In decentralized settings, a greedy rule uniquely maximizes these preferences; in centralized markets, the associated deferred-acceptance mechanism uniquely implements them. This framework subsumes canonical models, such as reserves and matroids, while accommodating complex objectives involving intersectional identities that lie beyond the scope of existing approaches. Our analysis provides unified axiomatic foundations and comparative statics for a broad class of distributional policies.</description>

      <title>Continuation-Performance Decomposition in Dynamic Games with Irreversible Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Once failure is irreversible, continuation payoffs cannot be meaningfully aggregated across strategies that differ in their survival properties. Standard scalar evaluation sidesteps this by arbitrarily completing payoffs beyond termination, but such completions are extrinsic to the game form. This paper introduces continuation-performance decomposition (CPD), proving that any evaluation satisfying natural regularity conditions, such as failure-completion invariance, survival locality, and local expected-utility coherence -- must separate continuation from performance lexicographically. Continuation priority thus emerges as a consequence of well-posed evaluation, not as a behavioral assumption. We establish equivalence between CPD and the limit of games with diverging failure penalties, show that viability is a game-form invariant independent of payoffs, and apply the framework to bank runs: preemptive withdrawals reflect rational viability vetoes rather than coordination failure when continuation is distributively asymmetric. CPD resolves a representational problem, not a preference problem.</description>

      <title>Competitive Sequential Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two horizontally differentiated firms compete for consumers who are partially informed about their future preferences. The firms screen consumers by offering menus of option contracts. Each consumer enters contracts with both firms. Subsequently, each consumer learns his preferences and purchases only one product. We find the unique equilibrium. Relative to spot pricing, consumption is distorted because each consumer is endogenously locked into one firm. If contracting is sufficiently early, so that consumers are less informed and hence less differentiated, consumers benefit; this reverses the conclusion in the monopoly case. Exclusive contracting further benefits consumers by intensifying competition.</description>

      <title>On the Inefficiency of Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether a social planner can improve the efficiency of learning, measured by the expected total welfare loss, in a sequential decision-making environment. Agents arrive in order and each makes a binary action based on their private signal and the social information they observe. The planner can intervene by jointly designing the social information disclosed to agents and offering monetary transfers contingent on agents' actions. We show that, despite such flexibility, efficient learning cannot be restored with a finite budget: whenever learning is inefficient without intervention, no combination of information disclosure and transfers can achieve efficient learning while keeping total expected transfers finite.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatically define a cardinal social inefficiency function, which, given a set of alternatives and individuals' vNM preferences over the alternatives, assigns a unique number -- the social inefficiency -- to each alternative. These numbers -- and not only their order -- are uniquely defined by our axioms despite no exogenously given interpersonal comparison, outside option, or disagreement point. We interpret these numbers as per-capita losses in endogenously normalized utility. We apply our social inefficiency function to a setting in which interpersonal comparison is notoriously hard to justify -- object allocation without money -- leveraging techniques from computer science to prove an approximate-efficiency result for the Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Efficiency in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in large population games, decentralized information aggregation generically corrects for individual-level biases. This establishes a new testable aggregate efficiency benchmark where the behavior of boundedly rational agents mimics that of fully rational agents. However, we find that structural economic forces such as strategic network formation and profit-maximizing platforms can systematically select pathological environments to exploit individuals' biases, thereby causing aggregate inefficiencies. We characterize these inefficiencies in monopoly and labor markets. Our findings therefore suggest that policy should shift focus from correcting individuals' behavior to monitoring and regulating information structures.</description>

      <title>Robust Aggregation of Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a society composed of individuals who have diverse sets of beliefs (or models) and diverse tastes (or utility functions). It characterizes the model selection process of a social planner who wishes to aggregate individuals' beliefs and tastes but is concerned that their beliefs are misspecified (or incorrect). A novel impossibility result emerges under several desiderata: a utilitarian social planner who prioritizes robustness to misspecification never aggregates individuals' beliefs but instead behaves as a dictator by adopting one individual's belief as the social belief. This tension between robustness and aggregation exists because aggregation yields policy-contingent beliefs, which are very sensitive to policy outcomes. The impossibility can be resolved, but it would require assuming individuals have heterogeneous tastes and some common beliefs. Applications in treatment choice and dynamic macroeconomics are explored.</description>

      <title>Characteristics Design: A Hedonic Approach to Optimal Product Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the generalized hedonic-linear model of Pellegrino (2025), this paper studies optimal product differentiation when a representative consumer has preferences over product characteristics. Under multiproduct monopoly, the monopolist's choice of product characteristics is always aligned with the social planner's optimum, despite underproduction. By contrast, under oligopoly, multiple equilibria can arise that differ qualitatively in their patterns of characteristics design. We show that, while oligopoly equilibria exhibiting product differentiation yield higher welfare than those with product concentration, the degree of product differentiation under oligopoly remains below the socially optimal level. As a result, social welfare under oligopoly is typically lower than under monopoly, highlighting a key advantage of coordination in characteristics design. We extend the analysis to settings with overlapping ownership structures and show that common ownership can improve welfare by inducing firms to soften competition through increased product differentiation rather than output reduction.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>On the Trail of Lost Pennies: player-funded tug-of-war on the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random-turn resource-allocation games. In the Trail of Lost Pennies, a counter moves on $\mathbb{Z}$. At each turn, Maxine stakes $a \in [0,\infty)$ and Mina $b \in [0,\infty)$. The counter $X$ then moves adjacently, to the right with probability $\tfrac{a}{a+b}$. If $X_i \to -\infty$ in this infinte-turn game, Mina receives one unit, and Maxine zero; if $X_i \to \infty$, then these receipts are zero and $x$. Thus the net receipt to a given player is $-A+B$, where $A$ is the sum of her stakes, and $B$ is her terminal receipt. The game was inspired by unbiased tug-of-war in~[PSSW] from 2009 but in fact closely resembles the original version of tug-of-war, introduced [HarrisVickers87] in the economics literature in 1987. We show that the game has surprising features. For a natural class of strategies, Nash equilibria exist precisely when $x$ lies in $[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, for a certain $\lambda \in (0,1)$. We indicate that $\lambda$ is remarkably close to one, proving that $\lambda \leq 0.999904$ and presenting clear numerical evidence that $\lambda \geq 1 - 10^{-4}$. For each $x \in [\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, we find countably many Nash equilibria. Each is roughly characterized by an integral {\em battlefield} index: when the counter is nearby, both players stake intensely, with rapid but asymmetric decay in stakes as it moves away. Our results advance premises [HarrisVickers87,Konrad12] for fund management and the incentive-outcome relation that plausibly hold for many player-funded stake-governed games. Alongside a companion treatment [HP22] of games with allocated budgets, we thus offer a detailed mathematical treatment of an illustrative class of tug-of-war games. We also review the separate developments of tug-of-war in economics and mathematics in the hope that mathematicians direct further attention to tug-of-war in its original resource-allocation guise.</description>

      <title>From No-Regret to Strategically Robust Learning in Repeated Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.
  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and a strong strategic robustness guarantee in this auction setting. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory.</description>
