      <title>Managing CO2 under global and country-specific net-zero emissions targets in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union (EU) is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This requires capturing CO2, eventually transporting it to different regions, to then either convert it into valuable products or sequester it underground. While the target is set for the EU as a whole, a significant part of the governance and strategy remains in the individual member states. Using the networked sector-coupled model PyPSA-Eur, we explored the impacts of imposing net-zero emissions globally for the entire EU versus imposing carbon neutrality for each country. Under a global CO2 target, some countries remain net CO2 emitters, while others become net CO2 absorbers. Forcing net-zero emissions in every country increases system cost by 1.4%, demands varied CO2 prices, and triggers higher investment in direct air capture and renewable capacities. In both scenarios, a significant portion of the captured CO2 is transported across Europe either directly in CO2 pipelines or indirectly via solid biomass or synthetic methane gas, methanol, and oil.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of the Properties of Geometric Network with Node Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement changes the underlying spatial representation of the participated mobile objects or nodes. In real world scenario, such mobile nodes can be part of any biological network, transportation network, social network, human interaction, etc. The change in the geometry leads to the change in various desirable properties of real-world networks especially in human interaction networks. In real life, human movement is concerned for better lifestyle where they form their new connections due to the geographical changes. Therefore, in this paper, we design a model for geometric networks with mobile nodes (GNMN) and conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of their properties. We analyze the effect of node mobility by evaluating key network metrics such as connectivity, node degree distribution, second hop neighbors, and centrality measures. Through extensive simulations, we observe significant variations in the behavior of geometric networks with mobile nodes.</description>

      <title>Constructive agents nullify the ability of destructive agents to foster cooperation in public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies have revealed a paradoxical phenomenon in public goods games, wherein destructive agents, harming both cooperators and defectors, can unexpectedly bolster cooperation. Building upon this intriguing premise, our paper introduces a novel concept: constructive agents, which confer additional benefits to both cooperators and defectors. We investigate the impact of these agents on cooperation dynamics within the framework of public goods games. Employing replicator dynamics, we find that unlike destructive agents, the mere presence of constructive agents does not significantly alter the defective equilibrium. However, when the benefits from constructive agents are outweighed by the damage inflicted by destructive agents, the addition of constructive agents does not affect the ability of destructive agents to sustain cooperation. In this scenario, cooperators can be maintained through a cyclic dominance between cooperators, defectors, and destructive agents, with constructive agents adding complexity but not fundamentally changing the equilibrium. Conversely, if the benefits from constructive agents surpass the harm caused by destructive agents, the presence of constructive agents nullifies the ability of destructive agents to foster cooperation. Our results highlight the nuanced role of constructive agents in cooperation dynamics, emphasizing the necessity of carefully assessing incentive balances when encouraging cooperation.</description>
