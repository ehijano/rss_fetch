      <title>Slowly decaying strain solitons in nonlinear viscoelastic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the modeling of longitudinal strain waves in a rod composed of a nonlinear viscoelastic material characterized by frequency-dependent second- and third-order elastic constants. We demonstrate that long waves in such a material can be effectively described by a damped Boussinesq-type equation for the longitudinal strain, incorporating dissipation through retarded operators. Using the existing theory of solitary wave solutions in nearly integrable systems, we derive a slowly-decaying strain soliton solution to this equation. The derived soliton characteristics are shown to be in a good agreement with results from full 3D simulations. We demonstrate the importance of taking into account the frequency dependence of third-order elastic constants for the description of strain solitons.</description>

      <title>Bacterial proliferation pattern formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This "modularity" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the "proliferation pattern formation" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Localized synchronous patterns in weakly coupled bistable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by numerical continuation studies of coupled mechanical oscillators, we investigate branches of localized time-periodic solutions of one-dimensional chains of coupled oscillators. We focus on Ginzburg--Landau equations with nonlinearities of Lambda-Omega type and establish the existence of localized synchrony patterns in the case of weak coupling and weak-amplitude dependence of the oscillator periods. Depending on the coupling, localized synchrony patterns lie on a discrete stack of isola branches or on a single connected snaking branch.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional nonlinear term affects the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. We found that flux jumps occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures.</description>
