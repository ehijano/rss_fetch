      <title>A new oscillatory regime in two-strain epidemic models with partial cross-immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious diseases often involve multiple strains that interact through the immune response generated after an infection. This study investigates the conditions under which a two-strain epidemic model with partial cross-immunity can lead to self-sustained oscillations, and reveals a new oscillatory regime in these models. Contrary to previous findings, which suggested that strong cross-immunity and significant asymmetry between strains are necessary for oscillations, our results demonstrate that sustained oscillations can occur even with weak cross-immunity and weak asymmetry. Using asymptotic methods, we provide a detailed mathematical analysis showing that the steady state of coexistence becomes unstable along specific curves in the parameter space, leading to oscillatory solutions for any value of the basic reproduction number greater than one. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, highlighting an unexpected oscillatory region in the parameter domain. These results challenge the current understanding of oscillatory dynamics in multi-strain epidemiological models, point to an oversight in previous studies, and suggest broader conditions under which such dynamics can arise.</description>

      <title>Promoting Cooperation in the Public Goods Game using Artificial Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as facilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory Cooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where players evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents Mimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of COVID-19 with imperfect vaccine and virus mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the effect of a partially protective vaccine on COVID-19 infection with the original and mutant virus with the help of a deterministic mathematical model developed. The model we developed consists of five compartments and thirteen parameters. The model consists of S (susceptible), V (vaccinated), I_1 (infected with original virus), I_2 (infected with mutant virus) and R (recover) subcompartments. With the established model, imperfect vaccines and mutant virus for the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey were examined. We examined the effect of both artificial active immunity (vaccinated) and natural active immunity (passing disease) in the model. Since it is known that the recovery and death rates of the original virus and the mutant virus are different in COVID-19, we considered it in the study. We performed local stability and global stability analysis by calculating the disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point of the model. We also obtained the basic reproduction number with the help of the next generation matrix method. We estimated three model parameters with parameter estimation and identified model-sensitive parameters with local sensitivity analysis. Next, we showed the existence of a backward bifurcation using the Castillo-Chavez and Song Bifurcation Theorem. Additionally, to illustrate the underlying fundamental mechanisms of the model dynamics and to support the analytical findings, we presented three distinct simulations.</description>

      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of multiple ecDNA types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can drive oncogene amplification, gene expression and intratumor heterogeneity, representing a major force in cancer initiation and progression. The phenomenon becomes even more intricate as distinct types of ecDNA present within a single cancer cell. While exciting as a new and significant observation across various cancer types, there is a lack of a general framework capturing the dynamics of multiple ecDNA types theoretically. Here, we present novel mathematical models investigating the proliferation and expansion of multiple ecDNA types in a growing cell population. By switching on and off a single parameter, we model different scenarios including ecDNA species with different oncogenes, genotypes with same oncogenes but different point mutations and phenotypes with identical genetic compositions but different functions. We analyse the fraction of ecDNA-positive and free cells as well as how the mean and variance of the copy number of cells carrying one or more ecDNA types change over time. Our results showed that switching does not play a role in the fraction and copy number distribution of total ecDNA-positive cells, if selection is identical among different ecDNA types. In addition, while cells with multiple ecDNA cannot be maintained in the scenario of ecDNA species without extra fitness advantages, they can persist and even dominate the ecDNA-positive population if switching is possible.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of "risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>
