      <title>Cartan semigroups and twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that twisted groupoid C*-algebras are characterised, up to isomorphism, by having Cartan semigroups, a natural generalisation of normaliser semigroups of Cartan subalgebras. This extends the classic Kumjian-Renault theory to general twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebras, even non-reduced C*-algebras of non-effective groupoids.</description>

      <title>Almost elementary groupoid models for $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of almost elementariness for a locally compact Hausdorff \'{e}tale groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ with a compact unit space was introduced by the authors as a sufficient condition ensuring the reduced groupoid $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\mathcal{G})$ is (tracially) $\mathcal{Z}$-stable and thus classifiable under additional natural assumption. In this paper, we explore the converse direction and show that many groupoids in the literature serving as models for classifiable $C^*$-algebras are almost elementary. In particular, for a large class $\mathcal{C}$ of Elliott invariants and a $C^*$-algebra $A$ with $\operatorname{Ell}(A)\in \mathcal{C}$, we show that $A$ is classifiable if and only if $A$ possesses a minimal, effective, amenable, second countable, almost elementary groupoid model, which leads to a groupoid-theoretic characterization of classifiability of $C^*$-algebras with certain Elliott invariants. Moreover, we build a connection between almost elementariness and pure infiniteness for groupoids and study obstructions to obtaining a transformation groupoid model for the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$.</description>

      <title>A note on the positivity of inverse operators acting on $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive and invertible linear operator $T$ acting on a $C^*$-algebra, we give necessary and sufficient criteria for the inverse operator $T^{-1}$ to be positive, too. Moreover, a simple counterexample shows that $T^{-1}$ need not be positive even if $T$ is unital and its spectrum is contained in the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequality Associated to Doubling Condition for State Preserving Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove maximal inequality and ergodic theorems for state preserving actions on von Neumann algebra by an amenable, locally compact, second countable group equipped with the metric satisfying the doubling condition. The key idea is to use Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality, a version of the transference principle, and certain norm estimates of differences between ergodic averages and martingales.</description>

      <title>Michael's selection theorem and applications to the Mar\'echal topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mar\'echal topology, also called the Effros-Mar\'echal topology, is a natural topology one can put on the space of all von Neumann subalgebras of a given von Neumann algebra. It is a result of Mar\'echal from 1973 that this topology is Polish as soon as the ambient algebra has separable predual, but the sketch of proof in her research announcement appears to have a small gap. Our main goal in this paper is to fill this gap by a careful look at the topologies one can put on the space of weak-$*$ closed subspaces of a dual space. We also indicate how Michael's selection theorem can be used as a step towards Mar\'echal's theorem, and how it simplifies the proof of an important selection result of Haagerup and Winsl{\o}w for the Mar\'echal topology. As an application, we show that the space of finite von Neumann algebras is $\mathbf\Pi^0_3$-complete.</description>

      <title>Real $K$-Theory for $C^*$-Algebras: Just the Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is intended to present the basic properties of $KO$-theory for real $C^*$-algebras and to explain its relationship with complex $K$-theory and with $KR$- theory. Whenever possible we will rely upon proofs in printed literature, particularly the work of Karoubi, Wood, Schr\"oder, and more recent work of Boersema and J. M. Rosenberg. In addition, we shall explain how $KO$-theory is related to the Ten-Fold Way in physics and point out how some deeper features of $KO$-theory for operator algebras may provide powerful new tools there. Commutative real $C^*$-algebras NOT of the form $C^R(X)$ will play a special role. We also will identify Atiyah's $KR^0(X, \tau ))$ in terms of $KO_0$ of an associated real $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>On The Evans Chain Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the construction of the Evans chain complex for higher-rank graph $C^*$-algebras. Specifically, we introduce a block matrix presentation of the differential maps. These block matrices are then used to identify a wide family of higher-rank graph $C^*$-algebras with trivial K-theory. Additionally, in the specialized case where the higher-rank graph consists of one vertex, we are able to use the K\"unneth theorem to explicitly compute the homology groups of the Evans chain complex.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multivariate Hypercomplex Function Inequalities and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the Mond-Pecaric method to functions with multiple operators as arguments by providing arbitrarily close approximations of the original functions. Instead of using linear functions to establish lower and upper bounds for multivariate functions as in prior work, we apply sigmoid functions to achieve these bounds with any specified error threshold based on the multivariate function approximation method proposed by Cybenko. This approach allows us to derive fundamental inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions, leading to new inequalities based on ratio and difference kinds. For applications about these new derived inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions, we first introduce a new concept called W-boundedness for hypercomplex functions by applying ratio kind multivariate hypercomplex inequalities. W-boundedness generalizes R-boundedness for norm mappings with input from Banach space. Additionally, we develop an approximation theory for multivariate hypercomplex functions and establish bounds algebra, including operator bounds and tail bounds algebra for multivariate random tensors.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative $C^*$-algebra Net: Learning Neural Networks with Powerful Product Structure in $C^*$-algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new generalization of neural network parameter spaces with noncommutative $C^*$-algebra, which possesses a rich noncommutative structure of products. We show that this noncommutative structure induces powerful effects in learning neural networks. Our framework has a wide range of applications, such as learning multiple related neural networks simultaneously with interactions and learning equivariant features with respect to group actions. Numerical experiments illustrate the validity of our framework and its potential power.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional analogues of Choi matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of linear maps on a von Neumann factor, we associate two objects, bounded operators and trace class operators, both of which play the roles of Choi matrices. Each of them is positive if and only if the original map on the factor is completely positive. They are also useful to characterize positivity of maps as well as complete positivity. It turns out that such correspondences are possible for every normal completely bounded map if and only if the factor is of type I. As an application, we provide criteria for Schmidt numbers of normal positive functionals in terms of Choi matrices of $k$-positive maps, in infinite dimensional cases. We also define the notion of $k$-superpositive maps, which turns out to be equivalent to the property of $k$-partially entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Is Every Product System Concrete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is every product system of Hilbert spaces over a semigroup $P$ concrete, i.e. isomorphic to the product system of an $E_0$-semigroup over $P$? The answer, in general, is no. We record a non-example when $P$ is cancellative and is not embeddable in a group. However, we show that the answer is yes for a reasonable class of semigroups which includes solid, Borel subsemigroups of locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Failure of almost uniformly convergence for noncommutative martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a counterexample to show that in sharp contrast to the classical case, the almost uniform convergence may not happen for truly noncommutative $L_p$-martingales when $1\leq p&lt;2$. The same happens to ergodic averages. The proof consists of some sharp estimates of the distributional function of a sequence of matrices and some non standard transference techniques, which might admit further applications.</description>

      <title>Traces on the uniform tracial completion of $\mathcal{Z}$-stable C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform tracial completion of a C*-algebra A with compact non-empty trace space T(A) is obtained by completing the unit ball with respect to the uniform 2-seminorm $\|a\|_{2,T(A)}=\sup_{\tau \in T(A)} \tau(a^*a)^{1/2}$. The trace problem asks whether every trace on the uniform tracial completion is the $\|\cdot\|_{2,T(A)}$-continuous extension of a trace on A. We answer this question positively in the case of C*-algebras that tensorially absorb the Jiang-Su algebra, such as those studied in the Elliott classification programme.</description>

      <title>Interpolation theorems for conjugations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a separable complex Hilbert space. A conjugate-linear map $C:H\to H$ is a conjugation if it is an involutive isometry. In this paper, we consider the following interpolation problems: Let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{y_i\}_{i\in I}$ be two orthogonal sets of vectors in $H$, and let $N$ and $\{N_k\}_{k\in K}$ be normal operators such that the $N_k$'s mutually commute. Then, under which conditions does there exist a conjugation $C$ on $H$ such that
  (a) $Cx_i=y_i$ and $CN_kC=N_k^*$ for all $i\in I$ and $k\in K$; or
  (b) $Cx_i=y_i$, for every $i\in I$, and $CNC=-N^*$.
  Using the spectral projections of normal operators, we provide complete answers to problems (a) and (b). As an application, we characterize hyperinvariant subspaces of normal operators using conjugations. Additionally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to certain equations in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$.</description>
