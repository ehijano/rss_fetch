      <title>The TDE Population from First-Principles Models of Stellar Disruption and Debris Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physically-grounded population model for optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) that combines first-principles hydrodynamic simulations of stellar disruption with statistical inference of the underlying stellar and black hole populations. The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\sim 30\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical thermonuclear supernovae triggered by the tidal disruption of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap. WD TDEs may produce a diverse set of transients with extreme asymmetry and peculiar composition.</description>

      <title>Twenty-four thousand hours of GREENBURST observations with the GBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to fast radio burst (FRB) searches carried out using dedicated surveys, a number of radio observatories take advantage of commensal opportunities with large facilities in which observations for other projects can be searched for FRBs and other transient sources. We present the results from one such effort, the first 24,186 hours of the GREENBURST search for dispersed radio pulses with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\sim70-80\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin. Further observations and monitoring are required to determine whether it is terrestrial or celestial.</description>

      <title>From cosmological simulations to binary black hole mergers: The impact of using analytical star formation history models on gravitational-wave source populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\,M_\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Emission from the S147 Region: Indication of Escaping Cosmic Rays Interacting with Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of $\gamma$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $\gamma$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\alpha$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\Gamma \approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\gamma$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Anatomy of Neutrino Decoherence in Red Turbulence: A Fractional Calculus Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20313v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \propto t^{-\nu}e^{-t/\tau_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\xi$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\cos 2\theta_m \approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\xi &lt; \xi_c \approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\xi = 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\sim 1\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\nu \geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in 3-D Hydrodynamic Simulations with X-ray Spectral Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe), thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems, are widely used as standard candles owing to the empirical width-luminosity relation of their light curves. Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$\alpha$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A multi-technique search for year-scale $\gamma$-ray quasi-periodic modulation in the high-redshift FSRQ PKS~2052$-$47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate year-scale quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission of the high-redshift flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~2052$-$47 using monthly binned \emph{Fermi}-LAT data spanning MJD~54727.99--58507.99. To assess the statistical significance of periodic features embedded in red-noise-dominated variability, we apply several complementary timing techniques, including the Lomb--Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet $Z$-transform, date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, REDFIT assuming an AR(1) process, and damped random walk modelling. The analyses reveal a dominant quasi-periodic modulation on a timescale of $\sim600$--630~d, together with a secondary longer-timescale feature near $\sim1050$--1110~d. Monte Carlo simulations show that the shorter-period signal exceeds the highest local confidence levels, while the longer modulation reaches $\gtrsim99$ per cent local significance in several tests; independent DRW-based simulations place both peaks above the $4\sigma$ envelope in the Lomb--Scargle analysis. Spectral-window diagnostics indicate that the detected periodicities are not artefacts of uneven sampling, and a sliding-window analysis shows that the QPO power is episodic across the $\sim11$~yr baseline. We discuss possible physical interpretations in terms of geometric Doppler modulation associated with jet precession or helical motion, accretion-driven instabilities, and SMBBH-induced dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Black Hole Magnetospheres with Inclined Ambient Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Signatures of Jet-Ejecta Interaction in Early Kilonovae: Prediction from Realistic Atomic Opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of the jet-ejecta interaction in early kilonova (t &lt; 1day) using detailed atomic opacities developed in Banerjee et al. (2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t~1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa ~200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t~= 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach ~ 19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by ~ 2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of ~ 60 deg for t &lt;=1 days. Rapid follow-up with future ultraviolet facilities, such as ULTRASAT and UVEX, will provide powerful probes of jet-ejecta interaction through early-time kilonova observations.</description>

      <title>The Need for Ultra High Resolution X-ray Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the broad science case for obtaining milliarcsecond to microarcsecond astronomical imaging resolution in the soft to medium-energy X-ray band (~0.5 to ~8 keV). Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances. In particular, we discuss the Accretion Explorer, a mission architecture under current study for a dispersed aperture X-ray interferometer.</description>

      <title>An X-ray-Emitting Proto-Cluster at $z\approx5.7$ Reveals Rapid Structure Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \times10^{44} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \times 10^{13} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.</description>

Abstract: A review of the current status of the field of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) including a summary of remaining open questions was presented in the white paper "Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays: at the Intersection of the Cosmic and Energy Frontiers" (Astropart. Phys. 147 (2023) 102794; arXiv:2205.05845). The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E&gt;3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers. This paper summarizes the PBR payload and its expected performance.</description>

      <title>An unexpected population of quenched galaxies harbouring under-massive SMBHs revealed by tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \lesssim M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.</description>

      <title>Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Interpolation of Sagittarius A*'s Multi-Wavelength Light Curves Using Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance, assuming gas pressure only, using Rosseland-mean opacities from free-free and bound-free absorption plus electron scattering, with ionization fractions given by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Bound-free opacity introduces flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. Comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that BBH systems within ~10 Mpc can exhibit a detectable IR excess. Our results highlight the need for physically consistent opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic (EM) signatures of BBHs approaching coalescence and support integration of metallicity-dependent opacity tables. Our opacity-informed framework for irradiated CBDs provides an EM template for identifying stellar- to intermediate-mass BBHs in a mass range sparsely sampled by LISA, thereby bridging the gravitational-wave-EM gap with testable IR/optical signatures.</description>

      <title>Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before explosion: interpreting SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi</title>

Abstract: Massive red supergiants (RSGs) are known to become hydrodynamically unstable before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi, for which pulsating RSG progenitors were reported. We demonstrate that the pre- and post-SN characteristics of SN 2023ixf agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model and exhibit meaningful differences from hydrostatic models. The data coverage is insufficient to break all degeneracies. We find insufficient evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models, in particular for massive stars from $\gtrsim 15\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.</description>

      <title>Noisy Timing Behavior is a Feature of Central Compact Object Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| &lt;10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s &lt; 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray-emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

Abstract: We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, , fainter and longer than previous 1D models. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Fast Flavor Conversion by Red Turbulence in Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in supernovae, driven by neutrino-neutrino refraction, can catastrophically equilibrate flavors and potentially affect the neutrino-driven explosion. We present a pivotal insight: matter density fluctuations characterized by \textit{extremely red spectra} ($\nu&lt;0$, where $|\nu| \equiv -\nu &gt; 0$) naturally arising in stratified supernova environments, can suppress such instabilities by inducing accelerated decoherence. By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|\nu|}$-we uncover a novel \textit{acceleration of coherence loss}. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($\nu \sim -1$, fluctuation strength $\xi \sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration {(or vice versa)}. Our work provides the first analytical criterion for FFC suppression in turbulent media and identifies red turbulence as a critical, physics-grounded ingredient missing from current supernova models.</description>

Abstract: Reactions between atomic nuclei are measured in great detail in terrestrial laboratory experiments; transferring and extrapolating this knowledge to how the same reactions act within cosmic environments presents major challenges. Cross-disciplinary efforts are needed in view of the many nuclear reactions that govern the chemical evolution of the universe, and occur in a broad range of stellar plasma conditions that require astrophysical exploration. Since the early identification of 'processes' of nucleosynthesis, new insights have been obtained on the complexity of nuclear reaction mechanisms. We use 12C induced capture and fusion processes to illustrate the challenge of low-energy measurements and of using theoretical methods to extrapolate measurements towards energy regimes within cosmic sources. Particle beam experiments at accelerator facilities above and deep underground simulate stellar reactions, new experimental facilities and methods complement these, and this is further complemented by improved theoretical tools to calculate the quantum effects of nuclear reactions at the various cosmic conditions. Astronomical signatures of cosmic nuclear reactions are deduced from light curves characterizing cosmic explosions through gamma-ray lines and presolar grains to the detection of rare neutrino particles from our Sun to distant cosmic events. High resolution spectroscopy of stars has been expanded to objects measured in the X-ray and the gamma energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astro-seismology and isotopic analysis of meteoritic inclusions provide new tools. Chemical-evolution models describe the complex dynamics during the evolution of galaxies. This article summarizes the experimental and theoretical work, and the broad range of observational tools that test the experimental data and the theoretical interpretation of nuclear processes in the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments</title>

Abstract: Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</description>

      <title>Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes</title>

Abstract: Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium structure and radial oscillation spectrum of neutron stars. Using a realistic neutron star model with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasinormal modes: weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while those below remain unaffected. Although neutron star radial oscillations are difficult to observe, our results suggest that extensions of this work can turn neutron star seismology into a novel probe of the axion properties.</description>
