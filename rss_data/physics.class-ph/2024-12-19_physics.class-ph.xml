      <title>The integral form of Gauss' law for a generic case of the electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analytically examined the integral form of Gauss' law for arbitrarily moving charges inside and outside an arbitrarily moving and deforming Gaussian surface with the Maxwell equations under consideration. We have obtained a simple looking differential equation $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\text{t}}\oint_{s(t)}\vec{E}\cdot\text{d}\vec{s}(t)=\frac{I^{(s)}_{\text{in}}(t)}{\epsilon_0}$ for time-dependent Gauss' flux-integral. We have explicitly calculated the time-derivative of the flux-integral for the electric field passing through the Gaussian surface for such a generic non-static case and have found no changes in the form of Gauss' law.</description>

      <title>The Soft-Membrane Surface Forces Apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compliant walls are widespread in biological and engineering systems. Because of their singular nature, adapted tools are required to accurately study their rheological properties as well as the consequences of the latter within a given mechanical setting. Because of their slender nature, membranes can be considered as prototypical examples of highly compliant boundaries. In this study, we describe a modified Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) developed to measure the forces acting on a compliant membrane by measuring its deformation field. We discuss how such a device can be used to characterize the rheology of suspended membranes and accurately measure the electrostatic interactions between a polarized membrane and a spherical electrode, without the need of an external measurement spring.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Curzon-Ahlborn heat engine: Extending the Yvon engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One famous paper in this field [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now known as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, making a pioneering contribution to the genesis of finite-time thermodynamics. Despite its significance, similar findings have surfaced throughout history; for instance, the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 shares the exact same EMP as the CA engine. This study extends Yvon's original approach to reanalyze the finite-time optimization of the CA engine. Our investigation not only bridges the gap between the Yvon engine and the CA engine but also serves as a suitable example for teaching undergraduate thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given its concise and easy-to-understand derivation.</description>

      <title>Maximally Nonlinear and Nonconservative Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an algorithmic method to find the conservative energy and non-conservative power of a large class of maximally nonlinear electric circuits (including Josephson tunnel junctions, coherent quantum phase slips, and superconducting loops), based on the incidence matrix of the circuits' digraph. We consider two-port linear circuits with mostly holonomic constraints provided by either Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current rules or Maxwell-Kirchhoff's voltage rules. The circuit's independent variables, generally a superset of the degrees of freedom, are obtained from the solution space of Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current or voltage rules. The method does not require to find any Lagrangian. Instead, the circuit's classical or quantum Hamiltonian is obtained from the energy of the reactive (i.e., conservative) circuit elements by means of transformations complementary to Hamilton's equations. Dissipation (loss) is accounted for by using the Rayleigh dissipation function and defining generalized Poisson brackets--Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. Fluctuations (noise) are added as voltage or current sources characterized by bath modes. Non-conservative elements (e.g., noisy resistors) are included ab initio using the incidence-matrix method, without needing to treat them as separate elements. Finally, we show that in order to form a complete set of canonical coordinates, auxiliary (which could be parasitic in certain cases) circuit elements are required to find the Hamiltonian of circuits with an incomplete set of generalized velocities. In particular, we introduce two methods to eliminate the coordinates associated with the auxiliary elements by either Hamiltonian reduction or equation-of-motion reduction. We use auxiliary circuit elements to treat a maximally nonlinear circuit comprising simultaneously both a Josephson junction and a quantum phase slip.</description>

      <title>Effective transport barriers in the biquadratic nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nontwist area-preserving maps violate the twist condition at specific orbits, resulting in shearless invariant curves that prevent chaotic transport. Plasmas and fluids with nonmonotonic equilibrium profiles may be described using nontwist systems, where even after these shearless curves breakup, effective transport barriers persist, partially reducing transport coefficients. Some nontwist systems present multiple shearless curves in phase space, increasing the complexity of transport phenomena, which have not been thoroughly investigated until now. In this work, we examine the formation of effective transport barriers in a nontwist area-preserving mapping with multiple shearless transport barriers. By quantifying the effectiveness of each transport barrier in phase space, we identify two scenarios where particular barriers dominate over others. Our results also reveal configurations where the interplay of two transport barriers creates regions in phase space with significant orbit trapping, influencing overall transport dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented here is a transcription of the lecture notes from Professor Allan N. Kaufman's graduate statistical mechanics course at Berkeley from the 1972-1973 academic year. Part 1 addresses equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, classical fluids and other systems, chemical equilibrium, and long-range interactions. Part 2 addresses non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, Brownian motion, Liouville and Klimontovich equations, Landau equation, Markov processes and Fokker-Planck equation, linear response and transport theory, and an introduction to non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics.</description>
