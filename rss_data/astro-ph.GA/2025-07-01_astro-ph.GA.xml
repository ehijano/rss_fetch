      <title>A systematic search for dormant galaxies at z~5-7 from the JWST NIRSpec archive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of "dormant" galaxies at z&gt;5, which have recently halted their star formation and are characterized by weak emission lines and significant Balmer breaks. So far, only three such galaxies have been published at z&gt;5 with low stellar masses, $M_*&lt;10^9M_\odot$ (so-called mini-quenched galaxies), and one massive quiescent galaxy at z&gt;5 with $M_*=10^{10.2}M_\odot$, without any such galaxy reported at intermediate masses. Here, we present a systematic search for dormant galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7.4 which halted star formation at least 10 Myr before the time of observation. To do this, we make use of all the publicly available NIRSpec prism data in the DAWN JWST Archive and select galaxies showing low H{\alpha} equivalent widths ($EW_{0}&lt;50$\AA) and strong Balmer breaks ($F_{\nu,4200}/F_{\nu,3500}&gt;1.4$). We find 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^{7.6}-10^{10.5}$, revealing an intermediate-mass population of such galaxies. By construction, the 14 sources reported are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star formation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according to models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts driving a "breathing" mode of star formation. Our results show that ~1% of the galaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories and span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected using only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).</description>

      <title>MOSDEF-3D: Keck/OSIRIS Maps of the Ionized ISM in $z \sim 2$ Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line maps of four galaxies at $z \sim 2$ observed with Keck/OSIRIS to study the physical conditions of the ISM at Cosmic Noon. Our analysis of strong emission line ratios in these galaxies reveals an offset from the local star-forming locus on the BPT diagram, but agrees with other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Despite the offset towards higher [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$ and [N II]$\lambda6585$/H$\alpha$, these strong-line ratios remain consistent with or below the maximum starburst threshold even in the inner $\sim 1$ kpc region of the galaxies, providing no compelling evidence for central AGN activity. The galaxies also exhibit flat radial gas-phase metallicity gradients, consistent with previous studies of $z \sim 2$ galaxies and suggesting efficient radial mixing possibly driven by strong outflows from intense star formation. Overall, our results reveal the highly star-forming nature of these galaxies, with the potential to launch outflows that flatten metallicity gradients through significant radial gas mixing. Future observations with JWST/NIRSpec are crucial to detect fainter emission lines at higher spatial resolution to further constrain the physical processes and ionization mechanisms that shape the ISM during Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>DeepDive: A deep dive into the physics of the first massive quiescent galaxies in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the DeepDive program, in which we obtained deep ($1-3$ hours) JWST/NIRSpec G235M/F170LP spectra for 10 primary massive ($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}=10.8-11.5$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3-4$. A novel reduction procedure extends the nominal wavelength coverage of G235M beyond H$\alpha$ and [NII] at $z\sim4$, revealing weak, narrow H$\alpha$ lines indicative of low star formation rates (${\rm SFR}\sim0-5\, M_\odot\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$). Two out of 10 primary targets have broad H$\alpha$ lines, indicating the presence of AGNs. We also conduct an archival search of quiescent galaxies observed with NIRSpec gratings in the DAWN JWST Archive, which provides a statistical context for interpreting the DeepDive targets. This archival search provides a spectroscopic sample of 140 quiescent galaxies spanning $1&lt;z&lt;5$ and covering more than an order of magnitude in stellar mass. We revisit the selection of quiescent galaxies based on rest-frame $UVJ$ colors, specific star formation rates, and the detection of the 4000\r{A} spectral break, finding $\sim90\%$ overlap between these criteria. The sample of a total of 150 quiescent galaxies constructed in this study shows that those at $z\sim3-5$, including the DeepDive targets, typically exhibit weaker 4000\r{A} breaks and bluer colors than their lower-redshift counterparts, indicating generally younger stellar populations. Stacked spectra of sources grouped by the $D_n4000$ index reveal faint Iron and Magnesium absorption line features in the stellar continuum even for the low $D_n4000$ ($D_n4000&lt;1.35$) subsample at high redshift ($z\sim3$). In addition, higher $D_n4000$ subsamples show fainter nebular emission lines. These results demonstrate that medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy is essential for robustly characterizing the diversity and evolution of early quiescent galaxies. All data from this study will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Observed Anti-parallel Correlation Between Spiral Galaxy and Cosmic Filament Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of galactic angular momentum and its connection to the cosmic web remains a pivotal issue in galaxy formation. Using kinematic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate the alignment between the spin directions of spiral galaxies and their host cosmic filaments. By incorporating filament spin measurements derived from redshift asymmetry across filament spines, we reveal a mass-dependent anti-parallel correlation: low-mass spiral galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) \lesssim 10$) exhibit a statistically significant anti-parallel alignment between their stellar/gas spins and filament spins, while high-mass spirals show no such trend. Spatial analysis further indicates that high-mass spirals preferentially reside near filament spines, whereas low-mass spirals occupy filament outskirts. These findings extend previous alignment studies that neglected directional spin correlations and provide new insights into how cosmic environments shape galactic angular momentum. The observed anti-parallel trend suggests a critical role for filament spin in regulating the angular momentum acquisition of low-mass spirals. This anti-parallel alignment is significantly enhanced for low-mass spirals residing in dynamically cold filaments, highlighting the importance of filament properties in shaping galaxy spin.</description>

      <title>The most massive star clusters in molecular clouds: Insights from the integrated cloud-wide initial mass function (ICIMF) theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the high-resolution ALMA, JWST and HST observations provides unprecedented insights into the connection between individual molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations in nearby galaxies. The molecular clouds in five nearby galaxies were identified based on the integrated intensity maps of CO (2$-$1) emission from ALMA observations. We used the JWST 21 $\mu$m data to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the clouds and calculate the masses of the embedded stellar populations in the clouds. After matching the star cluster and stellar association catalogs derived from the HST observations with the identified molecular clouds, we found clear correlations between the physical parameters of molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations. Based on the masses of the total stellar populations and their corresponding clouds, we obtained a typical value of the cloud-scale star formation efficiency (SFE), $\approx$1.4\%. The mass of the most massive cluster ($M_{\rm cluster, max}$) in a cloud is positively proportional to the mass ($M_{\rm cloud}$), the column density, the SFR sand the SFR surface density of the cloud. The observed $M_{\rm cluster, max}$-$M_{\rm cloud}$ relation can be interpreted theoretically on the basis of the integrated cloud-wide IMF (ICIMF) theory, which provides a quantitative framework for understanding the correlations between molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations.</description>

      <title>How Do Ionizing Photons Escape from Star-Forming Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1-100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. A UV integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph capable of resolving galaxies across these scales is necessary--and uniquely achievable with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory. In this article, we outline the scientific motivation, observables, and observational capabilities needed to make progress on these fundamental questions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Nature and Fate of the Almost-Dark Cloud AGC 226178 through HI Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic, almost dark HI clouds with extreme gas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature and fate of the "almost dark" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short, low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178 and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor preventing its disruption.</description>

      <title>BASIL: Fast broadband line-rich spectral-cube fitting and image visualization via Bayesian quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the spatial distributions and abundances of complex organic molecules in hot cores and hot corinos is crucial for understanding the astrochemical pathways and the inheritance of prebiotic material by nascent planetary systems. However, the line-rich spectra from these sources pose significant challenges for robustly fitting molecular parameters due to severe line blending and unidentified lines. We present an efficient framework, Bayesian Active Spectral-cube Inference and Learning (BASIL), for estimating molecular parameter maps for hundreds of molecules based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, applied to wideband spectral datacubes of line-rich sources. We adopted stochastic variational inference to infer molecular parameters from spectra at individual positions, balancing between fitting accuracy and computational speed. For obtaining parameter maps, instead of querying every location or pixel, we introduced an active learning framework based on Bayesian quadrature and its parallelization. Specifically, we assessed and selected the locations or pixels of spectrum that are most informative for estimating the entire set of parameter maps by training a Gaussian processes model. By greedily selecting locations with maximum information gain, we achieve sublinear convergence. We benchmarked BASIL on a large synthetic datacube and demonstrated that it produces accurate 468 molecular parameter maps from 117 molecules within ~180 hours, orders of magnitude faster than traditional pixel-by-pixel fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, with visually reliable results emerging in just ~20 hours. Additional training iterations provide progressively more accurate results. This quick visualization meets the demands of big data in modern astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Uncover 3D Dark Matter Distribution of the Milky Way by an Empirical Triaxial Orbit-Superposition Model: Method Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dynamical model, named empirical triaxial orbit-superposition model, for the Milky Way halo. This model relies on minimal physical assumptions that the system is stationary, meaning the distribution function in 6D phase-space does not change when the stars orbiting in the correct gravitational potential. We validate our method by applying it to mock datasets that mimic the observations of the Milky Way halo from LAMOST + Gaia with stars' 3D position and 3D velocity observed. By removing the stellar disk and substructures, correcting the selection function, we obtain a sample of smooth halo stars considered as stationary and complete. We construct a gravitational potential including a highly flexible triaxial dark matter halo with adaptable parameters. Within each specified gravitational potential, we integrate orbits of these halo stars, and build a model by superposing the orbits together taking the weights of stars derived from the selection function correction. The goodness of the models are evaluated by comparing the density distributions as well as 3D velocity distributions numerically represented in the model to that in the data. The shape and radial density distribution of the underlying dark matter halo can be constrained well simultaneously. We apply it to three mock galaxies with different intrinsic shapes of their dark matter halos and achieved accurate recovery of the 3D dark matter density distributions for all.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings, we review the importance and complexity of detecting and characterizing supermassive binary black holes using conventional techniques (spectroscopy, timing, imaging). We show how spectropolarimetric data can strengthen or discard binary black hole candidates on solid grounds, and present what kind of instrument could perform this task. Namely, a high spectral resolution polarimeter operating from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the near-infrared (NIR), such as the POLLUX prototype, would perfectly fit within the payload of the Habitable Worlds Observatory and help revolutionize the study of extragalactic objects.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Turbulence Synthesis: Validation in 2D Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations can follow the evolution of fluid motions through the intricacies of developed turbulence. However, they are rather costly to run, especially in 3D. In the past two decades, generative models have emerged which produce synthetic random flows at a computational cost equivalent to no more than a few time-steps of a simulation. These simplified models qualitatively bear some characteristics of turbulent flows in specific contexts (incompressible 3D hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics), but generally struggle with the synthesis of coherent structures. We aim at generating random fields (e.g. velocity, density, magnetic fields, etc.) with realistic physical properties for a large variety of governing partial differential equations and at a small cost relative to time-resolved simulations. We propose a set of approximations applied to given sets of partial differential equations, and test the validity of our method in the simplest framework: 2D decaying incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence. We compare results of 2D decaying simulations with snapshots of our synthetic turbulence. We assess quantitatively the difference first with standard statistical tools: power spectra, increments and structure functions. These indicators can be reproduced by our method during up to about a third of the turnover time scale. We also consider recently developed scattering transforms statistics, able to efficiently characterise non-Gaussian structures. This reveals more significant discrepancy, which can however be bridged by bootstrapping. Finally, the number of Fourier transforms necessary for one synthesis scales logarithmically in the resolution, compared to linearly for time-resolved simulations. We have designed a multiscale turbulence synthesis (MuScaTS) method to efficiently short-circuit costly numerical simulations to produce realistic instantaneous fields.</description>

      <title>Even Redder than we Knew: Color and $A_{\mathrm{V}}$ Evolution up to $z=2.5$ from JWST/NIRCam Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam provides rest-frame near-IR photometry of galaxies up to $z=2.5$ with exquisite depth and accuracy. This affords an unprecedented view of the evolution of the UV-optical-near-IR color distribution and its interpretation in terms of the evolving dust attenuation, $A_{\mathrm{V}}$. We use the value-added data products (photometric redshift, stellar mass, rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors, and $A_{\rm V}$) provided by the public DAWN JWST Archive. This data product derives from fitting the spectral energy distributions obtained from multiple NIRCam imaging surveys, augmented with pre-existing HST imaging data. Our sample consists of a stellar mass complete sample of $\approx 28,000$ $M_\star&gt; 10^{9}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$. The $V-J$ color distribution of star-forming galaxies evolves strongly, in particular for high-mass galaxies ($M_\star&gt;3\times 10^{10}~M_\odot$), which have a pronounced tail of very red galaxies reaching $V-J&gt; 2.5$ at $z&gt;1.5$ that does not exist at $z&lt;1$. Such red $V-J$ can only be explained by dust attenuation, with typical values for $M_\star \approx 10^{11}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the range $A_{\mathrm{V}}\approx 1.5-3.5$ at $z\approx 2$. This redshift evolution went largely unnoticed before because the photometric redshift estimates for the reddest ($V-J&gt;2.5$), most attenuated galaxies has markedly improved thanks to the new, precise photometry. Despite the increased attenuation, $U-V$ colors across the entire mass range are slightly bluer at higher $z$. In conclusion, whereas the rest-frame UV-optical color distribution evolves remarkably little from $z=0.5$ to $z=2.5$, the rest-frame optical-near-IR color distribution evolves strongly, primarily due to a very substantial increase with redshift in dust attenuation for massive galaxies.

      <title>Macroscopic states in Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model with axionlike interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Wolf Approach to Constraining NIR Extinction Laws in the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viability of the star count (Wolf) method is assessed as a means of constraining the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law toward the Corona Australis molecular cloud. Using deep $JHK_S$ photometry from the VISIONS survey, extinction maps with 1 arcmin spatial resolution are constructed. The derived extinction ratios are $A_J/A_H=1.73\pm0.07$, $A_H/A_{K_S}=1.70\pm0.11$, and $A_J/A_{K_S}=3.02\pm0.22$, which are consistent with Galactic literature means. Assuming a power-law form ($A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$) for the NIR extinction law, we derive indices of $\alpha\approx 2.0$ across all wavelength combinations, with no statistically significant wavelength dependence throughout the NIR wavelength range. While spatial variations in extinction properties are tentatively observed across the cloud, concerns persist regarding the impact of photometric completeness, and the role of reference field selection. Continued research is required to refine the approach, and scrutinize the veracity of potential extinction law variations over a more expansive region of sky.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight acceleration as a test of the Galactic Yukawa potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast the impact of direct radial acceleration measurements, based on two redshift measurements of the same target one decade apart, on constraining the Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential in the Milky Way. The Galaxy's matter distribution is modeled as the sum of a spherical bulge, a spherical dark matter halo, and two axially symmetric disks. Considering a sample of 165 Milky Way globular clusters, we find that the precision of next-generation spectrographs ($\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$) is not sufficient to provide competitive constraints compared to rotation curve data using the same baryonic matter distribution. The latter sample only becomes competitive for a precision better than 0.6 cm s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, we find that adopting a population of $1.3 \times 10^5$ RR Lyrae stars as targets, a precision of $\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$ can achieve constraints on the Yukawa parameters as strong as with the rotation curves.</description>

      <title>EMPRESS. XV. A New Determination of the Primordial Helium Abundance Suggesting a Moderately Low $Y_\mathrm{P}$ Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the primordial helium abundance, $Y_\mathrm{P}$, based on Subaru observations. A major source of uncertainty in previous $Y_\mathrm{P}$ determinations is the lack of extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs; $0.01-0.1Z_\odot$), which have metallicities a few to ten times lower than the metal-poor galaxies (MPGs; $0.1-0.4Z_\odot$) predominantly used in earlier studies, requiring substantial extrapolation to zero metallicity. Here, we perform Subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of 29 galaxies, including 14 EMPGs. By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H for each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission lines, including the He I 10830 {\AA} line to break the density-temperature degeneracy. After carefully selecting galaxies with robust He/H determinations, and adding 58 galaxies from previous studies, we obtain $Y_\mathrm{P} = 0.2387^{+0.0036}_{-0.0031}$. This $Y_\mathrm{P}$ value is $\sim1\sigma$ lower than most of the previous estimates, but agrees with recent determinations using EMPGs and the CMB constraint from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment. Our result indicates $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.54^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$, showing a mild ($1-2\sigma$) tension with the Standard Model and Planck results. These tensions may suggest a nonzero lepton asymmetry, which would be alleviated with $\xi_\mathrm{e} = 0.05^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. More observations of EMPGs and further assessments of systematic uncertainties are essential to test the potential tension more rigorously.</description>

      <title>The distribution of metals in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies form due to the continuous accretion of gaseous material towards the centre of dark matter haloes, which gives rise to stellar discs once the gas reaches high density. Analysis of stellar age distribution shows that stars in the inner regions of the disc are born at earlier times, in contrast to those found in the outer regions, which constitute a younger population. This scheme, typical of galactic formation processes, is known as the "inside-out" scenario and is closely related to the global properties of a significant fraction of the population of spiral galaxies. In this study, we analyse model galaxies from the Auriga project, a set of high-resolution, magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, to investigate the distribution of metals at $z=0$. Since different galactic components were subjected to different formation histories, we focus on the distribution of metals in the halo, bulge, and disc using a dynamical decomposition method based on the degree of rotation of the stars and their gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>Beneath the Surface: &gt;85% of z&gt;5.9 QSOs in Massive Host Galaxies are UV-Faint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use [CII] observations of a large QSO sample to segregate sources by host galaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII] luminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass and used to rank 190 QSOs at z&gt;5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range (-22&lt;Muv&lt;-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN program, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}&gt;-24.5) and 25 especially UV-faint (Muv&gt;-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x, respectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]&gt;1.8x10^9 Lsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which are UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO luminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV luminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII] LFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are UV-bright (Muv&lt;-26), &gt;~85% are UV-faint (Muv&gt;-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV luminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and black hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions, black hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV luminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]&gt;1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed across a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23, the median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the local relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more massive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.</description>

      <title>Exploring the parameter space of hierarchical triple black hole systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40{\deg}-80{\deg}). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.</description>

      <title>Double Compact Binary Merger Rate Density in Open Star Clusters: Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying compact-object binary mergers in star clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamical interactions in galaxies. Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the signature of assembly bias and modified gravity using small-scale clusterings of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.</description>

      <title>Probing foreground residuals in cleaned CMB temperature maps from Planck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are extracted from multi-frequency observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the \emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to further improve the purpose of galactic masks.</description>

      <title>Correlation between H$\alpha$ emitters and their cosmic web environment at $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal constraints from emission-line galaxy clustering hinges on a robust understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation, we explore the correlation between properties of H$\alpha$ emitters and their environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our galactic H$\alpha$ emission model includes contributions from the warm interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a halo mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous ELGs ($L_{\rm{H}\alpha}&gt;10^{42}\ \rm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) reside in filaments and knots. More generally, ELGs are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments. While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are statistically significant for host halo masses $M\lesssim 10^{12}\ M_\odot/h$. Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Deep survey of millimeter RRLs towards the planetary nebulae IC 418 and NGC 7027</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23256</link>

Abstract: The circumstellar environments of PNe are wonderful chemically rich astrophysical laboratories in which the ionization of atoms and the formation of simple and complex molecules can be studied. The new high-sensitivity receivers open the possibility to carry out deep observations, essential to unveil weak atomic and molecular spectra in the mm range. The main goal of this work is to study the emission lines detected in the spectra of the bright C-rich PNe IC 418 and NGC 7027 and to identify all those emission features associated with radio recombination lines (RRLs) of light elements. We aim to analyze the RRLs detected on each source, and to model the sources and derive their physical parameters. This work allows us to provide the most complete and updated catalog of RRLs in space, carried out at 2, 3 and 7 mm with the IRAM 30m and the Yebes 40m radio telescopes. We compare these observational data sets with synthetic models produced with the radiation transfer code Co3RaL. Our observations reveal the presence of several H and He I RRLs at mm wavelengths in the spectra of IC 418 and NGC 7027 and also of HeIIi RRLs in the spectrum of NGC 7027. Many of these lines had remained undetected until now due to their weakness and the lack of high-sensitivity observations at these frequencies. The data also confirm the absence of molecular emission towards IC 418, above a detection level of ~3 mK [Tmb]. These mm observations represent the most extended RRL line survey of two C-rich PNe carried out so far, with most of the lines never reported before. These extremely complete catalogs evidence the importance of high-sensitivity observations and are expected to be very helpful in the line identification process in mm observations, in particular for still unknown or poorly characterized molecular species existing in the vicinity of ionized environments.</description>

      <title>On the origin of short-lived cocoon in 3C84: powered by tidal disruption events ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluated the jet power and the density of ambient matter in 3C 84 by using the momentum balance along the jet axis and the transonic condition for the cocoons observed at two different scales (approximately 1 and 6 parsec scales). For the inner cocoon, we precisely determined the ratio of jet power to ambient density $L_{\rm j}/n_{\rm a}$ to be $(0.3-0.7)\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. Similarly, for the outer cocoon, we found that this value is more than an order of magnitude larger at $(0.9-3.7)\times 10^{44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. This indicates that the outer cocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density of $20-300\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a power of $10^{43-44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a relatively low-density environment of $6-20\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results suggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\rm a}$, it appears to support the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years ago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about 25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\rm j}$ that generated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a short period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event driven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk instability.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe: Detection and Analysis of the Shell Surrounding the Runaway Wolf-Rayet Star WR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first radio--continuum detection of the circumstellar shell around the well-known WN8 type Wolf-Rayet star WR16 at 943.5\,MHz using the \ac{ASKAP} \ac{EMU} survey. At this frequency, the shell has a measured flux density of 72.2$\pm$7.2\,mJy. Using previous \ac{ATCA} measurements at 2.4, 4.8, and 8.64~GHz, as well as the \ac{EMU} observations of the star itself, we determine a spectral index of $\alpha\,=\,+0.74\pm0.02$, indicating thermal emission. We propose that the shell and star both exhibit thermal emission, supported by the its appearance in near-infrared and H$\alpha$ observations. The latest \textit{Gaia} parallax is used to determine a distance of 2.28$\pm$0.09\,kpc. This star is well-known for its surrounding circular nebulosity, and using the distance and an angular diameter of 8\farcm42, we determine the shell size to be 5.57$\pm$0.22~pc. We use the \textit{Gaia} \acp{PM} of WR16 to determine peculiar velocities of the star as $V_{\alpha}(pec) =$ --45.3$\pm$5.4\,\kms\ and $V_{\delta}(pec) =$ 22.8$\pm$4.7\,\kms, which indicates that the star is moving in a north-west direction, and translates to a peculiar tangential velocity to be 50.7$\pm$6.9\,\kms. We also use these \acp{PM} to determine the shell's origin, estimate an age of $\sim 9500\pm 1300$\,yr, and determine its average expansion velocity to be $280\pm40$\,\kms. This average expansion velocity suggests that the previous transitional phase is a \ac{LBV} phase, rather than a \ac{RSG} phase. We also use the measured flux at 943.5~MHz to determine a mass-loss rate of $1.753\times 10^{-5}~M_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, and use this to determine a lower-limit on ionising photons of $N_{UV} &gt; 1.406\times 10^{47}~$s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Studying the multi-phase interstellar medium in the Large Magellanic Cloud with SRG/eROSITA -- I. Analysis of diffuse X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), being a nearby and actively star-forming satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution, physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive view of the different ISM phases.
  We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of $1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a strong $\alpha$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local deficit in $\alpha$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at $P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input through tidally driven gas collisions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of images of protoplanetary disks after collision with free-floating planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational manifestations of disturbances in a protoplanetary disk caused by a collision with a massive planet are studied. It is assumed that the planet moves along a parabolic trajectory that intersects the disk plane near the star. Gas-dynamic simulation is performed using the finite volume method on a long time scale. On its basis, images of the disk observed from the pole and edge-on are constructed in the infrared and submillimeter ranges. A wide range of planet orbit parameters is considered. The approach of the planet was considered both prograde and retrograde with the respect to the disk rotation. Calculations have shown that in the images of the disk seen pole-on, two spiral arms can be observed in case of the prograde fall, and one with retrograde case. In the case of observations of a disk whose plane is inclined at a small angle to the line of sight, distortions of the disk plane can be noticeable. In addition, a gas tail is extended from the disk in the direction of the planet's motion, which can also be identified in observations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: From Theory to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Modeling blazar broadband emission with convolutional neural networks -- III. proton synchrotron and hybrid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the broadband emission of blazars has become increasingly challenging with the advent of multimessenger observations. Building upon previous successes in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leptonic emission scenarios, we present an efficient CNN-based approach for modeling blazar emission under proton synchrotron and hybrid lepto-hadronic frameworks. Our CNN is trained on extensive numerical simulations generated by SOPRANO, which span a comprehensive parameter space accounting for the injection and all significant cooling processes of electrons and protons. The trained CNN captures complex interactions involving both primary and secondary particles, effectively reproducing electromagnetic and neutrino emissions. This allows for rapid and thorough exploration of the parameter space characteristic of hadronic and hybrid emission scenarios. The effectiveness of the trained CNN is demonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent blazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino detections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino flux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that incorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood method. The trained CNN is integrated into the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC; https://www.mmdc.am), offering a robust tool for the astrophysical community to explore blazar jet physics within a hadronic framework.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: ~1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and ~200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet-host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Anchoring Stellar Age Indicators: A Cross-Calibration of [C/N] and Gyrochronology Ages via the Age-Velocity-Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining stellar ages is challenging, as it depends on other stellar parameters in a non-linear way and often relies on stellar evolution models to infer the underlying relation between these parameters and age. This complexity increases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct indicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the color-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on pre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only cover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a universal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1) explore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable, extending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and 2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations yield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the same AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective stars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they experience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all giants with metallicity &gt; -0.8 dex and [C/N] &lt; -0.05 dex, and can be used as an age-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\alpha$ disk. Lastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty after accounting for systematic offsets.</description>

Abstract: The formation of the first supermassive black holes is expected to have occurred in some most pronounced matter and galaxy overdensities in the early universe. We have conducted a sub-mm wavelength continuum survey of 54 $z\sim6$ quasars using the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometre Array-2 (SCUBA2) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to study the environments around $z \sim 6$ quasars. We identified 170 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with above 3.5$\sigma$ detections at 450 or 850 \um\, maps. Their FIR luminosities are 2.2 - 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{12} L_{\odot}$, and star formation rates are $\sim$ 400 - 1200 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also calculated the SMGs differential and cumulative number counts in a combined area of $\sim$ 620 arcmin$^2$. To a $4\sigma$ detection (at $\sim$ 5.5 mJy), SMGs overdensity is $0.68^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$($\pm0.19$), exceeding the blank field source counts by a factor of 1.68. We find that 13/54 quasars show overdensities (at $\sim$ 5.5 mJy) of $\delta_{SMG}\sim$ 1.5 - 5.4. The combined area of these 13 quasars exceeds the blank field counts with the overdensity to 5.5 mJy of \dsmg $\sim$ $2.46^{+0.64}_{-0.55}$($\pm0.25$) in the regions of $\sim$ 150 arcmin$^2$. However, the excess is insignificant on the bright end (e.g., 7.5 mJy). We also compare results with previous environmental studies of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) on a similar scale. Our survey presents the first systematic study of the environment of quasars at $z\sim6$. The newly discovered SMGs provide essential candidates for follow-up spectroscopic observations to test whether they reside in the same large-scale structures as the quasars and search for protoclusters at an early epoch.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Properties of Extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas in NGC$\,$3511 and NGC$\,$3513</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13012</link>

Abstract: Gaseous, disk-halo interfaces are shaped by processes that are critical to galaxy evolution, including gas accretion and outflows. Extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) layers are characterized by scale heights that largely exceed those predicted by their temperature, suggesting the presence of turbulent energy injection from star formation feedback. However, the origin of this large scale height remains uncertain. To explore the connection between eDIG and star-forming disks, we present a spatially-resolved case study of a nearby pair of sub-$L_*$, intermediately inclined disk galaxies NGC$\,$3511/3513. We decompose optical nebular lines observed using long-slit spectroscopy into narrow and broad velocity components. In NGC$\,$3511, the broad component has three distinctive characteristics in comparison to the narrow component: (1) significantly higher velocity dispersions (a median $\langle\sigma\rangle_{\text{Broad}} = 24$ \kms compared to $\langle\sigma\rangle_{\text{Narrow}} = 13$ \kms), (2) elevated [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ and [SII]$\lambda$6716/H$\alpha$ line ratios, and (3) a rotational velocity lag. These characteristics support the origin of the broad component in an extraplanar, gaseous disk. In NGC$\,$3513, the broad component reveals disk-halo circulation via localized outflows at radius $\lesssim 1$ kpc. For NGC$\,$3511, we test a vertical hydrostatic equilibrium model with pressure support supplied by thermal and turbulent motions. Under this assumption, the eDIG velocity dispersion corresponds to a scale height $h_{z} \gtrsim 0.2 - 0.4$ kpc at $R = 3 - 5$ kpc, a factor of a few above the thermal scale height ($h_{z} \lesssim 0.1$ kpc). This highlights the importance of turbulent motions to the vertical structure of the gaseous, disk-halo interface.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Fraction in Disk-Like Galaxies Over the Past 10 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an observational study of the dark matter fraction in star-forming disk-like galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 2.5$, selected from publicly available integral field spectroscopic surveys: KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$, KGES, and KROSS. To model the $H\alpha$ kinematics of these galaxies, we employ 3D forward-modelling, which incorporates beam-smearing and inclination corrections, and yields rotation curves. Subsequently, these rotation curves are corrected for gas pressure gradients, resulting in circular velocity curves or `intrinsic' rotation curves. Our final sample comprises of 263 rotationally supported main sequence star-forming galaxies with redshifts ranging from $0.6 \leq z &lt; 2.5$. We estimate the dark matter fraction of these galaxies by subtracting the baryonic mass from the total mass, where the total mass is derived from the intrinsic rotation curves. We provide novel observational evidence, suggesting that at a fixed redshift, the dark matter fraction gradually increases with radius such that the outskirts of galaxies are dark matter dominated, similarly to local star-forming disk galaxies. This observed dark matter fraction exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing redshift and, on average, the fraction within the effective radius (upto outskirts) remains above 50\%, similar to locals. We investigate the relationships between dark matter, baryon surface density, and circular velocity of galaxies. We observe that low stellar mass galaxies, with $\log(M_{\rm star}\ [\mathrm{M_\odot}]) \leq 10.0$, undergo a higher degree of evolution, which may be attributed to the hierarchical merging of galaxies. Most importantly, we discuss several sources of uncertainties and current limitations in the field, as well as their impact on the measurements of dark matter fraction and its trend across galactic scales and cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of the structure of star clusters is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. In this article, we explore the application of fractal dimension analysis to study the evolution of star clusters, also fractal dimension, a concept from fractal geometry, provides a quantitative measure of the complexity and self-similarity of geometric objects. By considering star clusters as complex networks, we employ the box covering method to calculate their fractal dimension. Our methodology combines the well-established Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Box-Covering (BC) methods and using these methods, the fractal structure of the clusters was determined. It was revealed that star clusters disintegrate at a fractal dimension of 1.3 and obey a power law. It should be noted that the obtained result was compared with the results of the McLuster.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of local halo building blocks: Thamnos and Sequoia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of galaxy evolution is the pace at which galaxies build up their mass. We investigate this hierarchical assembly by uncovering and timing accretion events experienced by our Galaxy. In the Milky Way, accreted debris has been identified in the local halo, thanks to Gaia. We combine this dataset with advances in colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting to characterise the Galaxy's building blocks based on their age and metallicity distributions. Here, we focus on the retrograde halo, specifically Thamnos and Sequoia. This study, part of the ChronoGal project, uses CMDft.Gaia to fit absolute CMDs of stars from these sub-structures, extracted from a local 5D Gaia DR3 dataset. By comparing their age and metallicity distributions with expected contamination from Gaia Enceladus (GE) and low-energy (LE) in situ populations, we identify distinct stellar population signatures for Sequoia and Thamnos. Both have metal-poor populations ([Fe/H] -2.5 to -1.5 dex) distinct from contamination. Their age distributions reveal the build-up pace of their progenitors: half of Sequoia's stars formed by 12 Gyr ago, while Thamnos appears slightly older and declines faster, forming half its stars by 12.3 Gyr. GE and LE populations formed half their stars by 12.1 Gyr and 12.9 Gyr, respectively. Caution is needed interpreting these distributions, especially for Sequoia, due to small sample sizes that can shift ages younger by up to 1 Gyr. Nonetheless, accounting for this and residual contamination, we conclude Thamnos, Gaia Enceladus, and Sequoia are predominantly old and were accreted within 1-2 Gyr of each other. We present, for the first time, age distributions for the retrograde halo sub-structures Sequoia and Thamnos, derived from photometric data using CMD fitting that also yields metallicity distributions consistent with spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Stellar reddening map from DESI imaging and spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new Galactic dust reddening maps of the high Galactic latitude sky using DESI imaging and spectroscopy. We directly measure the reddening of 2.6 million stars by comparing the observed stellar colors in $g-r$ and $r-z$ from DESI imaging with the synthetic colors derived from DESI spectra from the first two years of the survey. The reddening in the two colors is on average consistent with the Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1$. We find that our reddening maps differ significantly from the commonly used Schlegel et al. (1998) (SFD) reddening map (by up to 80 mmag in $E(B-V)$), and we attribute most of this difference to systematic errors in the SFD map. To validate the reddening map, we select a galaxy sample with extinction correction based on our reddening map, and this yields significantly better uniformity than the SFD extinction correction. Finally, we discuss the potential systematic errors in the DESI reddening measurements, including the photometric calibration errors that are the limiting factor on our accuracy. The $E(g-r)$ and $E(r-z)$ maps presented in this work, and for convenience their corresponding $E(B-V)$ maps with SFD calibration, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): Extending rest-optical narrow-band emission line selection into the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise $\sim4.7\mu$m narrow-band imaging over $\sim63$ arcmin$^{2}$ designed to enable selection of H$\alpha$ emitters at z~6.1 and a host of novel emission-line samples, including [OIII] ($z\sim8.3$) and Paschen $\alpha/\beta$ ($z\sim1.5/2.8$). For the F466N/F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to $\sim2\times$ more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5$\sigma$ limits of 0.8-1.2$\times10^{-18}\,\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$), corresponding to unobscured H$\alpha$ star-formation rates (SFRs) of 0.9-1.3 $\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ at z~6.1, extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also adds F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H$\alpha$ at z~2.23) that probes SFRs $\gtrsim5\times$ fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies ($\sim0.2\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. We present the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS, demonstrate the precision and accuracy of the expected redshift and measured emission line recovery through detailed simulations, and present examples of spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): An untargeted search for H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ and their physical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7$\mu$m, over 63 arcmin$^{2}$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6.1$, with H$\alpha$ star-formation rates ($\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$) $\sim0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. Combining our unique H$\alpha$ sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explored their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compared these to a broad-band selected sample at $z\sim 6$ which offered vital new insights into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes ($\beta$) were considerably redder for our H$\alpha$ sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-1.92$) compared to the broad-band sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-2.35$). This was not due to dust attenuation as our H$\alpha$ sample was relatively dust-poor (median $A_V=0.23$); instead, we argued the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ and the UV-continuum-derived $\rm{SFR_{UV}}$ to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{10}}$ and $\rm{SFR_{100}}$). We found an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H$\alpha$ emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses ($&lt;10^9 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$). We also found $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ strongly traced SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H$\alpha$ sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W $z \sim 6$ sample showed a larger scatter in $\rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}}$ across all stellar masses, which highlighted how narrow-band photometric selections of H$\alpha$ emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Magnetic Field Strength in Galaxy Clusters from Synchrotron Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in various astrophysical processes within the intracluster medium, including heat conduction, cosmic ray acceleration, and the generation of synchrotron radiation. However, measuring magnetic field strength is typically challenging due to the limited availability of Faraday Rotation Measure sources. To address the challenge, we propose a novel method that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) alongside synchrotron emission observations to estimate magnetic field strengths in galaxy clusters. Our CNN model is trained on either Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations or MHD galaxy cluster simulations, which incorporate complex dynamics such as cluster mergers and sloshing motions. The results demonstrate that CNNs can effectively estimate magnetic field strengths with median uncertainties of approximately $0.22\mu$G, $0.01\mu$G, and $0.1\mu$G for $\beta = 100$, 200, and 500 conditions, respectively. Additionally, we have confirmed that our CNN model remains robust against noise and variations in viewing angles with sufficient training, ensuring reliable performance under a wide range of observational conditions. We compare the CNN approach with the traditional magnetic field strength estimates method that assumes equipartition between cosmic ray electron energy and magnetic field energy. Unlike the equipartition method, this CNN approach does not rely on the equipartition assumption, offering a new perspective for comparing traditional estimates and enhancing our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spectroastrometry and Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei. II. Measuring Geometric Distances and Black Hole Masses of Four Nearby Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this constitutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD). III. The role of mergers and environment in active galactic nucleus activity in dwarf galaxies</title>

Abstract: Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.</description>

Abstract: Bar structures can form internally due to the instability of their host galaxies or externally due to perturbations from other galaxies. We systematically quantify the growth timescales ($\tau_\mathrm{bar}$) of bars formed through these two mechanisms with a series of controlled $N$-body simulations. In galaxies susceptible to bar instability, tidally induced bars display $\tau_\mathrm{bar}$ values comparable to those of internally developed bars within the same disk. Tidal perturbations promote(delay) bar formation by advancing(postponing) its onset, but the growth rate of the bar structure remains largely unchanged. In these interaction scenarios, the bar formation is still driven primarily by the galaxy's internal nature, which remains unaffected by tidal perturbations. As the external perturbation wave reaches the galaxy's center, it evokes a "seed bar" that is then swing amplified. In this scenario, the onset of bar formation is advanced. Conversely, bar formation may be delayed if the external perturbation wave is out of phase with the preexisting spontaneously developed "seed bar", which causes destructive interference and limits the bar growth. In the hot disk model that resists bar formation in isolation, the $\tau_\mathrm{bar}$ of the tidally forced bar correlates with the strength of the perturbation. The bar growth in this model deviates from an exponential profile and is better described by a linear function. The varied $\tau_\mathrm{bar}$ and the preference for linear growth contrast with bars formed in galaxies inherently susceptible to bar instability. These tidally forced bars may not adhere to the swing amplification mechanism that predicts exponential bar growth.</description>

      <title>Effects of Environment on the Size Evolution of Quiescent Galaxies: Comparing Galaxies in Clusters and in the Field at Two Rest-frame Wavelengths</title>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of environment on quiescent galaxy (QG) size evolution using the CLAUDS+HSC imaging covering 18.6~deg$^2$ in five broad filters ($Ugriz$) and the effective radius of a single-S\'{e}rsic fit as a proxy for galaxy size. We estimate sizes in two rest-frame wavelengths -- 3000\r{A} (UV) and 5000\r{A} (optical) -- for $\sim86,000$ massive ($M_*&gt;10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$) field QGs and for $1,000$ of their similarly massive counterparts from 47 clusters at $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.85$. We fit the size-mass relation (SMR) for field and cluster QGs in five $\Delta z=0.15$ redshift bins and use the characteristic size of $M_*=5\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ QGs (SMR's zero point) to trace the change in galaxy size over cosmic time and in two types of environment. Sizes of QGs are larger in the rest-frame UV than in the rest-frame optical in both clusters and the field, and this difference is more prominent in the field sample. However, QGs in clusters are systematically smaller than the field QGs, and this difference is significantly more pronounced if measured in the rest-frame UV light. Modeling of the redshift evolution in the characteristic QG size as $R_e\varpropto(1+z)^{\beta}$ shows that the cluster QGs ($\beta=-1.02$ in UV and $\beta= -1.00$ in optical) grow in size as fast as the field QGs ($\beta=-0.95$ in UV and $-1.22$ in optical). This fast growth of cluster QGs is consistent with size increase driven by the accretion of two subpopulations onto clusters: a) field QGs that are larger than their quiescent counterparts in clusters, and b) environmentally quenched galaxies (newcomers) that are larger than the rest of the quiescent population.</description>

      <title>Group Accretion in Milky Way-like Stellar Haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As galaxies form hierarchically, larger satellites may accrete alongside smaller companions in group infall events. This coordinated accretion is likely to have left signatures in the Milky Way's stellar halo at the present day. Our goal is to characterise the possible groups of companions that accompanied larger known accretion events of our Galaxy, and infer where their stellar material could be in physical and dynamical space at present day. We use the AURIGA simulation suite of Milky Way-like haloes to identify analogues to these large accretion events and their group infall companions, and we follow their evolution in time. We find that most of the material from larger accretion events is deposited on much more bound orbits than their companions. This implies a weak dynamical association between companions and debris, but it is strongest with the material lost first. As a result, the companions of the Milky Way's earliest building blocks are likely to contribute stars to the solar neighbourhood, whilst the companions of our last major merger are likely found in both the solar neighbourhood and the outer halo. More recently infallen groups of satellites, or those of a smaller mass, are more likely to retain dynamical coherence, for example, through clustering in the orientation of angular momentum. We conclude that group infall has likely shaped the Milky Way's stellar halo. Disentangling this will be challenging for the earliest accretion events, although overlap with their less-bound debris may be particularly telling.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Large-Scale Cold Gas Outflows Associated with Nuclear Winds in Reionization-Era Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies through multi-phase feedback driven by powerful nuclear outflows. Although this mechanism is central to theoretical models of SMBH--galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, direct observational evidence connecting nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows remains limited, especially in the early universe. Here we report statistical evidence for such a connection in a sample of luminous quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. We compare stacked [C\,{\sc ii}] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, for quasars with and without broad absorption lines (BALs) that indicate powerful nuclear winds on sub-kiloparsec scales. The BAL quasar stack exhibits a significant (S/N = 4.45) blueshifted broad component in the [C\,{\sc ii}] line profile, with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, whereas the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent to one-quarter of the nuclear wind energy may be transferred to cold neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These results suggest that BAL winds can couple to the host galaxy's interstellar medium, providing empirical support for models of multi-phase AGN feedback. This mechanism may also contribute to the observed diversity in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ among luminous quasars recently identified by JWST.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations: Morphological Analysis of Galaxies in TNG100 Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the morphology of galaxies in the TNG100 simulation by applying mock observation techniques and compare the results with the observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By employing a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach, we classify galaxies into four morphological categories (Ellipticals, S0/a, Sab/Sb, and Sc/Sd/Irregulars). Our findings show that the morphological characteristics of the mock-observed galaxy samples closely match those observed in the SDSS, successfully reproducing key features such as distinct parameter distributions for different types. However, some discrepancies are identified: notably, a significant lack of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the dwarf galaxy regime ($M_* &lt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) and minimal distinction between Sab/Sb and Sc/Sd/Irregular galaxies in the mock-observed samples, unlike the clear differences seen in actual observations. These divergences may stem from simulation properties such as elevated star formation efficiency at low mass end or resolution limits. Observational effects, including the impact of the Point Spread Function, sky background, and instrumental noise, can independently cause approximately 7.87\% morphological misclassifications by our CNN model. Compared to previous studies using gravity-based definitions of galaxies that failed to clearly distinguish the parameter distributions of ETGs versus Late-Type Galaxies, our brightness-based sample definition method better recovers the observed morphological parameter distributions, especially their distinct differences. Our study underscores that, alongside mock observations, employing galaxy segmentation methods consistent with observational practices is crucial for appropriately recovering realistic morphological parameters from simulations and enabling fair comparisons.</description>

      <title>Understanding gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gas mixing in a simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) using cosmological `zoom-in' simulations. We insert tracer dyes in the CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse physical properties to track gas mixing. We correlate the extent and shape of the dye spread with the local gas properties to understand gas mixing. Velocity dispersion and traceless symmetric shear tensors (pure shear deformation) in small regions (&lt;= 5 kpc) around the dye injection locations best predict the dye spread extent after 200 Myr. We use this to determine diffusion calibration constants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr aligns well with the velocity dispersion and magnetic field dispersion, the best alignment occurs with the dispersion of stretching eigenvectors (traceless symmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (antisymmetric shear or vorticity tensor) in large regions (10 kpc) around the dye injection locations. Therefore, shear statistics and velocity dispersion best predict the extent and shape of mixed gas. The linear temporal dependence of the dye spread suggests superdiffusion in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and large-scale coherent flows or numerical diffusion. Despite significant numerical mixing from our 1 kpc resolution (insufficient to resolve Reynolds numbers ~10^2-10^3, which require a few hundred pc resolution), our correlation results are robust thanks to fixed spatial resolution throughout the CGM. These results can be used to predict diffusion coefficients to model magnetic field diffusion, heat transport, and metal mixing.</description>

      <title>Properties of $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers and their associated sources in Sagittarius B2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the 22 GHz $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser line in the extended Sagittarius B2 cloud. We detect 499 $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39 and 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their spatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and protostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and 32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not established, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the spatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either outflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144 unique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with protostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and 18 with YSOs.
  The outflow-associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within $&lt;2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission extending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack of detections at $5 &lt; V_{rel} &lt; 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to maser self-absorption. We show how $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers trace the large-scale material flow in Sgr B2 N (North) also seen in SiO and mm continuum emission. Finally, we find that protostellar cores with associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers tend to have brighter 3 mm continuum emission on average, although there is no strong correlation between maser brightness and continuum flux.</description>

      <title>On the Physical Nature of Ly$\alpha$ Transmission Spikes in High Redshift Quasar Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) transmission spikes at $5.2 &lt; z &lt; 6.8$ using synthetic quasar spectra from the ``Cosmic Reionization On Computers" simulations. We focus on understanding the relationship between these spikes and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Disentangling the complex interplay between IGM physics and the influence of galaxies on the generation of these spikes presents a significant challenge. To address this, we employ Explainable Boosting Machines, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to quantify the relative impact of various IGM properties on the Ly$\alpha$ flux. Our findings reveal that gas density is the primary factor influencing absorption strength, followed by the intensity of background radiation and the temperature of the IGM. Ionizing radiation from local sources (i.e. galaxies) appears to have a minimal effect on Ly$\alpha$ flux. The simulations show that transmission spikes predominantly occur in regions of low gas density. Our results challenge recent observational studies suggesting the origin of these spikes in regions with enhanced radiation. We demonstrate that Ly$\alpha$ transmission spikes are largely a product of the large-scale structure, of which galaxies are biased tracers.</description>

      <title>Chronicling the reionization history at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ with emergent quasar damping wings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectra of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At redshifts $z&lt;6$, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is nearly ionized, while at $z&gt;7$ the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ where the Lyman series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts $6.0&lt;z&lt;7.1$ to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars' continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyman $\alpha$ line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$, while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.10_{&lt;10^{-4}}^{+0.73}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.10$, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.33}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.47}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.46$, and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.21}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.87$. At the same time we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 7\ {\rm Myr}$ across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new self-consistent perturbative expansion for realistic isolated differentially rotating systems -- disc galaxies. At leading order it is formally equivalent to Ehlers' Newton-Cartan limit, which we reinterpret in terms of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The self-consistent coupling of these quasilocal terms leads to first-order differences from the conventional Newtonian limit. A modified Poisson equation is obtained, along with modifications to the equations of motion for the effective fluid elements. By fitting to astrophysical data, we show that the phenomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies can be reproduced. Potential important consequences for gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. Episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure, i.e., leading to an Alfv\'en Mach number of $\sim2$. Some regions above and below the disc mid-plane show sub-Alfv\'enic conditions with intermittent outflow activity. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs, especially with respect to their turbulent components.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by the recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation {either significantly weakens or disappears} for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation, which likely originates from hierarchical mergers. {This suggests that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the overall population can be explained by the superposition of two distinct subpopulations.} {We find Bayesian evidence strongly favoring two separate $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions over a single mass-ratio-dependent distribution, with Bayes factors $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;4.2$.} The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function {showing a rapid decline beyond} $\sim 40M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2} \sim 0.4$, aligning with predictions for hierarchical mergers in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. {However, we cannot exclude negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$values in the second subpopulation, suggesting hierarchical mergers might occur both in AGN disks and stellar clusters. Furthermore, the inferred second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution might alternatively arise from other formation channels, such as stable mass transfer or chemically homogeneous evolution, if not interpreted as hierarchical mergers.}</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach to calculate the anharmonic infrared (IR) absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), key carriers of interstellar aromatic IR bands. This method accounts for temperature effects in a molecule-specific way and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional quantum chemical calculations at a fraction of the cost, scaling linearly with system size. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms at different temperatures, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Consistencies and inconsistencies in redshift-independent distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redshift-independent distances underpin much of astrophysics, and there exists a plethora of methods to estimate them. However, the extent to which the distances they imply are consistent, while crucial for the integrity of the distance ladder, has been little explored. We construct a statistical framework to assess both internal (between measurements with the same method) and external (between-method) consistency by comparing differences between distances to their quoted statistical uncertainties in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Distances (NED-D). 66 of the 76 indicators in NED-D are amenable to a consistency test by having at least two measurements to the same galaxy or at least one measurement to a galaxy also measured by another method. We find that only 12 of these methods produce self-consistent distances across literature determinations, of which 7 are also consistent with distances to the same galaxies measured by all other methods. The most consistent 6 methods (M-stars luminosity, Novae, Masers, Globular Cluster Fundamental Plane, O- and B-type Supergiants and BL Lac Luminosity) also give similar average distances to the mean of all indicators, while the 7th (Proper Motion) underestimates distances relative to the mean by 17.1%. We also investigate consistency of Cepheid distances in the SH0ES 2022 catalogue, finding no evidence for unaccounted-for systematics. Our NED-D results imply that considerable work remains to obtain reliable distances by a multitude of methods, a crucial endeavour for constructing a multiply cross-checked and fully robust distance ladder. We make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Detection of an Absorption Feature in ESP 39607: Evidence for an Ultra-Fast Inflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations, including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes. Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.</description>

      <title>The Intracluster Light of Abell 3667: Unveiling an Optical Bridge in LSST Precursor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim 30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2 $) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The inner regions of BCG1 ($r &lt; 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r &lt; 50\text{ kpc}$) are consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of these features with its six photometric bands.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe to which typical SIDM models are subject. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, which features only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of Metal-Poor Turn-Off Stars: One with [Fe/H] &lt; -4 and Three with [Fe/H] &lt; -3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9 dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>
