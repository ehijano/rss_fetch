      <title>Reservoir Computing Benchmarks: a review, a taxonomy, some best practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing is an Unconventional Computation model to perform computation on various different substrates, such as RNNs or physical materials. The method takes a "black-box" approach, training only the outputs of the system it is built on. As such, evaluating the computational capacity of these systems can be challenging. We review and critique the evaluation methods used in the field of Reservoir Computing. We introduce a categorisation of benchmark tasks. We review multiple examples of benchmarks from the literature as applied to reservoir computing, and note their strengths and shortcomings. We suggest ways in which benchmarks and their uses may be improved to the benefit of the reservoir computing community</description>

      <title>A trustless society? A political look at the blockchain vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lot of business and research effort currently deals with the so called decentralised ledger technology blockchain. Putting it to use carries the tempting promise to make the intermediaries of social interactions superfluous and furthermore keep secure track of all interactions. Currently intermediaries such as banks and notaries are necessary and must be trusted, which creates great dependencies, as the financial crisis of 2008 painfully demonstrated. Especially banks and notaries are said to become dispensable as a result of using the blockchain. But in real-world applications of the blockchain, the power of central actors does not dissolve, it only shifts to new, democratically illegitimate, uncontrolled or even uncontrollable power centers. As interesting as the blockchain technically is, it doesn't efficiently solve any real-world problem and is no substitute for traditional political processes or democratic regulation of power. Research efforts investigating the blockchain should be halted.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the abstract Tile Assembly Model Using Crisscross Slats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tile assembly systems in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) are computationally universal and capable of building complex shapes, but DNA-based implementations encounter formidable error rates that stifle this theoretical potential. Slat-based self-assembly is a recent development wherein DNA forms long slats that combine together in 2 layers, rather than the aTAM's square tiles in a plane. While tiles tend to bind to 2 neighboring tiles at a time, slats may bind to dozens of other slats. Large slat-based DNA constructions have been implemented in the lab with incredible resilience to many of the errors that plague tile-based constructions, but these come at a cost as slat-based systems are often more difficult to design and simulate. Also, it has not been clear if slats, with their larger sizes and different geometries, have the same theoretical capabilities as tiles. Here we show that slats do, at least at scale. We give constructions showing that any aTAM system may be simulated by a system of slats and that these can be made more efficiently, using shorter slats and a smaller scale factor, when simulating simpler classes of systems. We consider 5 classes of aTAM systems with increasing complexity, from zig-zag systems to the full class of all aTAM systems, and show how they can be converted to equivalent slat systems. Zig-zag systems can be simulated by slats at only a $2c \times 2c$ scale (where $c$ is the freely chosen cooperativity of the slats), the full class of aTAM systems at only a $5c \times 5c$ scale, and intermediate classes using scales between these. Together, these results prove that slats have the full theoretical power of aTAM tiles while providing constructions compact enough to potentially provide designs for DNA-based implementations of slat systems that are both capable of powerful algorithmic self-assembly and possessing the strong error resilience of slats.</description>

      <title>Solving the Turbine Balancing Problem using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential for disruptive change in many sectors of industry, especially in materials science and optimization. In this paper, we describe how the Turbine Balancing Problem can be solved with quantum computing, which is the NP-hard optimization problem of analytically balancing rotor blades in a single plane as found in turbine assembly. Small yet relevant instances occur in industry, which makes the problem interesting for early quantum computing benchmarks. We model it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem and compare the performance of a classical rule-based heuristic and D-Wave Systems' Quantum Annealer Advantage_system4.1. In this case study, we use real-world as well as synthetic datasets and observe that the quantum hardware significantly improves an actively used heuristic's solution for small-scale problem instances with bare disk imbalance in terms of solution quality. Motivated by this performance gain, we subsequently design a quantum-inspired classical heuristic based on simulated annealing that achieves extremely good results on all given problem instances, essentially solving the optimization problem sufficiently well for all considered datasets, according to industrial requirements.</description>
