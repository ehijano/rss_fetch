      <title>An attempt to build a dynamical catalog of Solar System co-orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to fully study 1:1 mean-motion resonance in the Solar System. We calculated stability points applying a resonant semi-analytic theory valid for any value of eccentricity or inclination. The location of each equilibrium point changes as the orbital elements of an object change, which led us to map the location of them. For the case of low inclination and low eccentricity we recovered the known L4 and L5 points. The three global types of orbits for this resonance; Tadpoles, Quasi-satellites and Horseshoes, vary as a function of the orbital elements, even disappearing for some cases. In order to build a catalog of real co-orbital objects, we filtered the NASA Horizons asteroids catalog inside the maximum resonant width and analyzed which objects are indeed in resonance. In total, we found 167 objects to be in co-orbital resonant motion with Solar System planets excluding Jupiter. We were able to recover all the already known objects and to confirm the resonant state of some new ones. Mercury remains to be the only planet with zero known co-orbitals and no L5 Earth Trojan has been discovered so far. Among the interesting identified orbits we highlight the one of 2021 FV1, a new Mars Quasi-satellite. Despite having circulating critical angles, we found some objects to be dynamically driven by the resonance such as 2012 QR50.</description>

      <title>Detecting and sizing the Earth with PLATO: A feasibility study based on solar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission will observe the same area of the sky continuously for at least two years in an effort to detect transit signals of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star.
  Aims. We aim to study how short-term solar-like variability caused by oscillations and granulation would affect PLATO's ability to detect and size Earth if PLATO were to observe the Solar System itself.
  Methods. We injected Earth-like transit signals onto real solar data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. We isolated short-term stellar variability by removing any variability with characteristic timescales longer than five hours. We then added a noise model for a variety of different stellar magnitudes computed by PlatoSim assuming an observation by all 24 normal cameras. We first compared four different commonly used treatments of correlated noise in the time domain. We then tried to recover pairs of transit signals. Finally, we performed transit fits using realistic priors on planetary and stellar parameters.
  Results. We find that short-term solar-like variability affects the correct retrieval of Earth-like transit signals in PLATO data. Variability models accounting for variations with typical timescales at the order of one hour are sufficient to mitigate these effects. For bright targets (8.5 - 10.5 mag), the transit signal of an Earth analogue can reliably be detected in PLATO data. For faint targets the results of transit search algorithms have to be verified by transit-fitting algorithms to avoid false positive detections being flagged. For bright targets (V-mag $\leq$ 9.5), the radius of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star can be correctly determined at a precision of 3% or less, assuming that at least two transit events are observed and the characteristics of the host star are well understood.</description>

      <title>Revised Masses for Low Density Planets Orbiting the Disordered M-dwarf System TOI-1266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 126 new radial velocity measurements from the MAROON-X spectrograph to investigate the TOI-1266 system, which hosts two transiting sub-Neptunes at 10.8 and 18.8 days. We measure masses of $M_{b}=4.01~\pm~0.55~M_{\oplus}$ for TOI-1266 b and $M_{c}=2.00~\pm~0.72~M_{\oplus}$ for TOI-1266 c. Our mass measurements agree with existing HARPS-N observations which we combined using a weighted average yielding masses for TOI-1266 b, and c of $M_{b}=4.10~\pm~0.43~M_{\oplus}$, $M_{c}=2.4~\pm~0.54~M_{\oplus}$ respectively. The combined dataset enabled a $\approx30\%$ improvement in mass precision. With bulk densities of $\rho_{b}$ = 1.25 $\pm$ 0.36 g cm$^{-3}$ and $\rho_{c}$ = 1.36 $\pm$ 0.31 g cm$^{-3}$, the planets are among the lowest density sub-Neptunes orbiting an M dwarf. They are both consistent with rocky cores surrounded by hydrogen helium envelopes. TOI-1266 c may also be consistent with a water-rich composition, but we disfavor that interpretation from an Occam's razor perspective.</description>

      <title>The Polar Stratosphere of Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the Jovian upper atmosphere at high latitudes in the UV, IR and mm/sub-mm all indicate that the chemical distributions and thermal structure are broadly influenced by auroral particle precipitations. Mid-IR and UV observations have shown that several light hydrocarbons (up to 6 carbon atoms) have altered abundances near Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Ion-neutral reactions influence the hydrocarbon chemistry, with light hydrocarbons produced in the upper stratosphere, and heavier hydrocarbons as well as aerosols produced in the lower stratosphere. One consequence of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is the existence of ionospheric jets that propagate into the neutral middle stratosphere, likely acting as a dynamical barrier to the aurora-produced species. As the ionospheric jets and the background atmosphere do not co-rotate at the same rate, this creates a complex system where chemistry and dynamics are intertwined. The ion-neutral reactions produce species with a spatial distribution following the SIII longitude system in the upper stratosphere. As these species sediment down to the lower stratosphere, and because of the progressive dynamical decoupling between the ionospheric flows and the background atmosphere, the spatial distribution of the auroral-related species progressively follows a zonal distribution with increasing pressures that ultimately produces a system of polar and subpolar hazes that extends down to the bottom of the stratosphere. This paper reviews the most recent work addressing different aspects of this environment.</description>

      <title>Modifications of SPH towards three-dimensional simulations of an icy moon with internal ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are some traces of the existence of internal ocean in some icy moons, such as the vapor plumes of Europa and Enceladus. This implies a region of liquid water beneath the surface ice shell. Since liquid water would be essential for the origin of life, it is important to understand the development of these internal oceans, particularly their temperature distribution and evolution. The balance between tidal heating and radiative cooling is believed to sustain liquid water beneath an icy moon's surface. We aim to simulate the tidal heating of an internal ocean in an icy moon using 3-dimensional numerical fluid calculations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We incorporated viscosity and thermal conduction terms into the governing equations of SPH. However, we encountered two issues while calculating rigid body rotation using SPH with a viscous term: (1) conventional viscosity formulations generated unphysical forces that hindered rotation, and (2) there was artificial internal energy partitioning within the layered structure, which was due to the standard SPH formulations. To address the first issue, we modified the viscosity formulation.For the second, we adopted Density Independent SPH (DISPH) developed in previous studies to improve behavior at discontinuous surfaces. Additionally, we implemented radiative cooling using an algorithm to define fluid surfaces via the particle method. We also introduced an equation of state accounting for phase transitions. With these modifications, we have refined the SPH method to encompass all necessary physical processes for simulating the evolution of icy moons with internal oceans.</description>

      <title>Planetary migration in wind-fed non-stationary accretion disks in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accretion disk can be formed around a secondary star in a binary system when the primary companion leaves the Main sequence and starts to lose mass at an enhanced rate. We study the accretion disk evolution and planetary migration in wide binaries. We use a numerical model of a non-stationary alpha-disk with a variable mass inflow. We take into account that the low-mass disk has an extended region that is optically thin along the rotation axis. We consider irradiation by both the host star and the donor. The migration path of a planet in such a disk is determined by the migration rate varying during the disk evolution. Giants may open/close the gap several times over the disk lifetime. We identify the new type of migration specific to parts of the growing disk with a considerable radial gradient of an aspect ratio. Its rate is enclosed between the type 2 and the fast type 1 migration rates being determined by the ratio of time and radial derivatives of the disk aspect ratio. Rapid growth of the wind rate just before the envelope loss by the donor leads to the formation of a zone of decretion, which may lead to substantial outward migration. In binaries with an initial separation $a\lesssim 100$ AU migration becomes most efficient for planets with 60-80 Earth masses. This results in approaching a short distance from the host star where tidal forces become non-negligible. Less massive Neptune-like planets at the initial orbits $r_\mathrm{p} \lesssim 2$ AU can reach these internal parts in binaries with $a \lesssim 30$ AU. In binaries, mass loss by the primary component at late evolutionary stages can significantly modify the structure of a planetary system around the secondary component resulting in mergers of relatively massive planets with a host star.</description>

      <title>Vertical and temporal H3+ structure at the auroral footprint of Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of the vertical and temporal structure of the H3+ emission at the auroral footprint of Io, as observed by Juno/JIRAM. The brightness vertical profile shows a maximum at 600 km above 1 bar, with no apparent difference between the Main Alfv\'en Wing spot emission and the tail of the footprint. This observation is more compatible with a broadband energy distribution of the precipitating electrons, than a monoenergetic one. The temporal profile of H3+ column density has been observed after the passage of the MAW and shows a hyperbolic decrease. A model of H3+ decay is proposed, which takes into account the second-order kinetic of dissociative recombination of H3+ ions with electrons. The model is found to be in very good agreement with Juno observation. The conversion factor from radiance to column density has been derived, as well as the half-life for H3+, which is not constant but inversely proportional to the H3+ column density. This explains the wide range of H3+ lifetimes proposed before.</description>

      <title>C3PO III: On the Lithium Signatures Following Planet Engulfment by Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 co-moving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Mining: ACT&amp;Friends' Results for the GTOC 12 Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, the 12th edition of Global Trajectory Competition was organised around the problem referred to as "Sustainable Asteroid Mining". This paper reports the developments that led to the solution proposed by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team. Beyond the fact that the proposed approach failed to rank higher than fourth in the final competition leader-board, several innovative fundamental methodologies were developed which have a broader application. In particular, new methods based on machine learning as well as on manipulating the fundamental laws of astrodynamics were developed and able to fill with remarkable accuracy the gap between full low-thrust trajectories and their representation as impulsive Lambert transfers. A novel technique was devised to formulate the challenge of optimal subset selection from a repository of pre-existing optimal mining trajectories as an integer linear programming problem. Finally, the fundamental problem of searching for single optimal mining trajectories (mining and collecting all resources), albeit ignoring the possibility of having intra-ship collaboration and thus sub-optimal in the case of the GTOC12 problem, was efficiently solved by means of a novel search based on a look-ahead score and thus making sure to select asteroids that had chances to be re-visited later on.</description>

      <title>A novel conjunction filter based on the minimum distance between perturbed trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing congestion in the near-Earth space environment has amplified the need for robust and efficient conjunction analysis techniques including the computation of the minimum distance between orbital paths in the presence of perturbations. After showing that classical Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) computation schemes are unsuitable to treat Earth orbiting objects, the article presents an analytical approach to provide a more accurate estimate of the true distance between perturbed trajectories by incorporating the effect of zonal harmonics of arbitrary order. Cook's linear secular theory for the motion of the eccentricity vector is extended to include higher order eccentricity effects and applied to the computation of the minimum and maximum radii attained by two orbits at their mutual nodes, which can be employed to estimate the true distance between the two orbital paths and to establish an efficient algorithm for determining or excluding potential conjunctions. Extensive testing and validation are conducted using a high-fidelity propagator and a comprehensive dataset of resident space objects. The results demonstrate an accuracy below the km level for the orbit distance computation in 99\% of cases, which enables high-efficiency conjunction filtering.</description>

      <title>Breccia and basalt classification of thin sections of Apollo rocks with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human exploration of the moon is expected to resume in the next decade, following the last such activities in the Apollo programme time. One of the major objectives of returning to the Moon is to continue retrieving geological samples, with a focus on collecting high-quality specimens to maximize scientific return. Tools that assist astronauts in making informed decisions about sample collection activities can maximize the scientific value of future lunar missions. A lunar rock classifier is a tool that can potentially provide the necessary information for astronauts to analyze lunar rock samples, allowing them to augment in-situ value identification of samples. Towards demonstrating the value of such a tool, in this paper, we introduce a framework for classifying rock types in thin sections of lunar rocks. We leverage the vast collection of petrographic thin-section images from the Apollo missions, captured under plane-polarized light (PPL), cross-polarised light (XPL), and reflected light at varying magnifications. Advanced machine learning methods, including contrastive learning, are applied to analyze these images and extract meaningful features. The contrastive learning approach fine-tunes a pre-trained Inception-Resnet-v2 network with the SimCLR loss function. The fine-tuned Inception-Resnet-v2 network can then extract essential features effectively from the thin-section images of Apollo rocks. A simple binary classifier is trained using transfer learning from the fine-tuned Inception-ResNet-v2 to 98.44\% ($\pm$1.47) accuracy in separating breccias from basalts.</description>

      <title>H$_{2}$-H$_{2}$O demixing in Uranus and Neptune: Adiabatic structure models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demixing properties of planetary major constituents influence the interior structure and evolution of planets. Comparing experimental and computational data on the miscibility of hydrogen and water to adiabatic profiles suggests phase separation between these components occurs in the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. We aim to predict the atmospheric water abundance and transition pressure between the water-poor outer envelope and the water-rich deep interior in Uranus and Neptune. We construct seven H2-H2O phase diagrams from the available experimental and computational data. We compute interior adiabatic structure models and compare these to the phase diagrams to infer whether demixing is occurring. We obtain a strong water depletion in the top layer due to rain-out of water and find upper limits on the atmospheric water mass fraction Z_atm of 0.21 for Uranus and 0.16 for Neptune. The transition from the water-poor to the water-rich layer is sharp and occurs at pressures P_Z between 4 and 11 GPa. Using these constraints on Z_atm and P_Z, we find that the observed gravitational harmonics J2 and J4 can be reproduced if P_Z &gt; 10 GPa in Uranus and &gt; 5 GPa in Neptune, and if the deep interior has a high primordial water mass fraction of 0.8, unless rocks are also present. The agreement with J4 is improved if rocks are confined deeper than P_Z, for instance below a rock cloud level at 2000 K (20-30 GPa). These findings confirm classical few-layer models and suggest that a layered structure may result from a combination of primordial mass accretion and subsequent phase separation. Reduced observational uncertainty in J4 and its dynamic contribution, atmospheric water abundance measurements from an Orbiter with a Probe mission to Uranus (UOP) or Neptune, and better understanding of the mixing behaviour of constituents are needed to constrain the interiors of ice giants.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridge between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in density clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>The VSPEC Collection: A suite of utilities to model spectroscopic phase curves of 3D exoplanet atmospheres in the presence of stellar variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Variable Star PhasE Curve (VSPEC) Collection, a set of Python packages for simulating combined-light spectroscopic observations of 3-dimensional exoplanet atmospheres in the presence of stellar variability and inhomogeneity. VSPEC uses the Planetary Spectrum Generator's Global Emission Spectra (PSG/GlobES) application along with a custom-built multi-component time-variable stellar model based on a user-defined grid of stellar photosphere models to produce spectroscopic light curves of the planet-host system. VSPEC can be a useful tool for modeling observations of exoplanets in transiting geometries (primary transit, secondary eclipse) as well as orbital phase curve measurements, and is built in a modular and flexible configuration for easy adaptability to new stellar and planetary model inputs. We additionally present a set of codes developed alongside the core VSPEC modules, including the stellar surface model generator vspec-vsm, the stellar spectral grid interpolation code GridPolator, and a Python interface for PSG, libpypsg.</description>

      <title>Concentration of eigenfunctions on singular Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and a metric that is singular at the boundary. The associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is of the form of a Grushin operator plus a singular potential. In a supercritical parameter regime, we identify the rate of concentration and profile of the high-frequency eigenfunctions that accumulate at the boundary. We give an application to acoustic modes on gas planets.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-trace tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>A global colour mosaic of Mars from Mars Express HRSC high altitude observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-changing transparency of the Martian atmosphere hinders the determination of absolute surface colour from spacecraft images. While individual high-resolution images from low orbit reveal numerous colour details of the geology, the colour variation between images caused by scattering off atmospheric dust can easily be of greater magnitude. The construction of contiguous large-scale mosaics has thus required a strategy to suppress the influence of scattering, often a form of high-pass filtering, which limits their ability to convey colour variation information over distances greater than the dimensions of single images. Here we use a dedicated high altitude observation campaign with the Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) (Neukum and Jaumann, 2004; Jaumann et al., 2007), applying a novel iterative method to construct a globally self-consistent colour model. We apply the model to colour-reference a high-altitude mosaic incor-porating long-range colour variation information. Using only the relative colour information internal to individual images, the influence of absolute image to image colour changes caused by scattering is minimised, while the model enables col-our variations across image boundaries to be self-consistently reconstructed. The resulting mosaic shows a level of colour detail comparable to single images, while maintaining continuity of colour features over much greater distances, thereby increasing the utility of HRSC colour images in the tracing and analysis of martian surface structures.</description>

      <title>Retrograde Ring Formed Around Eccentric Extrasolar Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion flow around a giant planet using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by studying the local region of accretion disk around the planet. The results show that, when the initial orbit of the planet embedded in protoplanetary disk is eccentric, the accretion disk formed around the planet is retrograde during the evolution and may be a possible origin of the retrograde ring around eccentric extrasolar giant planet.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Viewing the PLATO LOPS2 Field Through the Lenses of TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PLATO will begin observing stars in its Southern Field (LOPS2) after its launch in late 2026. By this time, TESS will have observed the stars in LOPS2 for at least four years. We find that by 2025, on average each star in the PLATO field will have been monitored for 330 days by TESS, with a subset of stars in the TESS continuous viewing zone having over 1000 days of monitoring. There are currently 101 known transiting exoplanets in the LOPS2 field, with 36 of these residing in multiplanet systems. The LOPS2 field also contains more than 500 TESS planet candidate systems, 64 exoplanets discovered by radial velocity only, over 1000 bright (V$&lt;$13) eclipsing binary systems, 7 transiting brown dwarf systems, and 2 bright white dwarfs (G$&lt;$13). We calculate TESS and PLATO sensitivities to detecting transits for the bright FGK stars that make up the PLATO LOPS2 P1 sample. We find that TESS should have discovered almost all transiting giant planets out to approximately 30 d within the LOPS2 field, and out to approximately 100 d for the regions of the LOPS2 field within the TESS CVZ ($\sim20$ per cent of the LOPS2 field). However, we find that for smaller radius planets in the range 1-4 R$_\oplus$ PLATO will have significantly better sensitivity, and these are likely to make up the bulk of new PLATO discoveries.</description>
