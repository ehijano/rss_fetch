      <title>Monte Carlo Methods in the Manifold of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Wave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to implement random walks in the manifold of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov wave functions. The goal is to extend state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo approaches, in particular the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo technique, to systems where finite pairing order parameters or complex pairing mechanisms, e.g., Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing or triplet pairing, may be expected. Leveraging the flexibility to define a vacuum state tailored to the physical problem, we discuss a method to use imaginary-time evolution of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states to compute ground state correlations, extending beyond situations spanned by current formalisms. Illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Reversal of charge transfer doping on the negative electronic compressibility surface of MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong electron-electron interaction in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) gives rise to phenomena such as strong exciton and trion binding and excitonic condensation, as well as large negative exchange and correlation contributions to the electron energies, resulting in negative electronic compressibility. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to demonstrate a striking effect of negative electronic compressibility in semiconducting TMD MoS2 on the charge transfer to and from a partial overlayer of monolayer semimetallic WTe2. We track the changes in binding energy of the valence bands of both WTe2 and MoS2 as a function of surface transfer doping with donor (K) and acceptor (F4-TCNQ) species. Donor doping increases the binding energy of the MoS2 valence band, as expected, while counterintuitively reducing the binding energy of the WTe2 valence bands and core levels. The inverse effect is observed for acceptor doping, where a typical reduction in the MoS2 binding energies is accopanied by an unexpected increase in those of WTe2. The observations imply a reversal of the expected charge transfer; donor (acceptor) deposition decreases (increases) the carrier density in the WTe2 adlayer. The charge transfer reversal is a direct consequence of the negative electronic compressibility of the MoS2 surface layer, for which addition (subtraction) of charge leads to attraction (repulsion) of further charge from neighbouring layers. These findings highlight the importance of many-body interactions for the electrons in transition metal dichalcogenides and underscore the potential for exploring strongly correlated quantum states in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Origin of the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems appears often near magnetic quantum critical points (QCPs). This seems to be the case also for CeRh2As2 (Tc $\approx$ 0.31 K). CeRh2As2 shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, for a magnetic field along the c axis of the tetragonal unit cell, but only the SC1 phase is observed for a field along the basal plane. Furthermore, another ordered state (phase-I) is observed below T0 $\approx$ 0.48 K whose nature is still unclear: Thermodynamic and magnetic measurements pointed to a non magnetic multipolar state, but recent $\mu$SR and NQR/NMR experiments have clearly detected antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below T0 . Also, quasi-two-dimensional AFM fluctuations were observed in NMR and neutron-scattering experiments above T0. The proximity of a QCP is indicated by non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior observed above the ordered states in both specific heat $C(T)/T \propto T^{-0.6}$ and resistivity $\rho(T) \propto T^{0.5}$. These T-dependencies are not compatible with any generic AFM QCP. Because of the strong magnetic-field anisotropy of both the SC phase and phase I, it is possible to study a field-induced SC QCP as well a phase-I QCP by varying the angle $\alpha$ between the field and the c axis. Thus, by examining the behavior of the electronic specific-heat coefficient C(T)/T across these QCPs, we can determine which phase is associated with the NFL behavior. Here, we present low-temperature specific-heat measurements taken in a magnetic field as high as 21 T applied at several angles $\alpha$. We observe that the NFL behavior does very weakly depend on the field and on the angle $\alpha$, a result that is at odd with that observations in standard magnetic QCPs. This suggests a nonmagnetic origin of the quantum critical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Ramp reversal memory in bulk crystals of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ramp reversal memory (RRM) is a non-volatile memory effect previously observed in correlated oxides exhibiting temperature-driven metal-insulator transitions (MITs). In essence, when a system displaying RRM is heated to a specific temperature within the MIT regime - where metallic and insulating domains coexist - and then cooled by reversing the temperature ramp, the resistance increases in the subsequent heating cycle. Crucially, this increase occurs only in the vicinity of the reversal temperature, indicating that the system 'remembers' this temperature. However, this memory is erased in the next heating loop. While such an effect could potentially manifest in various systems, to date, it has only been reported in thin films of correlated transition metal oxides, including VO2, V2O3, and NdNiO3. In this work, we report the observation of RRM in macroscopic crystals of the layered material 1T-TaS2, which undergoes an MIT near 190 K along charge-density wave transitions. Our findings provide compelling evidence that RRM is a general phenomenon, extending beyond the previously studied oxides. Interestingly, the RRM in TaS2 displays significantly different characteristics: it is observed when reversing from cooling to heating (as opposed to heating to cooling), and its magnitude - representing the 'strength' of the memory - is nearly an order of magnitude larger than in correlated oxides. While we discuss potential mechanisms for the RRM in TaS2, a comprehensive first-principles model is still lacking. We hope that this study will prompt further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of ramp reversal memory, enhancing our understanding of this intriguing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of Gaussian unitary transformations for bosonic and fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian unitary transformations are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians containing quadratic terms in creations and annihilation operators, and are heavily used in many areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum optics and condensed matter theory to quantum information and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. They are known to form a representation of the metaplectic and spin group for bosons and fermions, respectively. These groups are the double covers of the symplectic and special orthogonal group, respectively, and our goal is to analyze the behavior of the sign ambiguity that one needs to deal with when moving between these groups and their double cover. We relate this sign ambiguity to expectation values of the form $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$, where $|0\rangle$ is a Gaussian state and $\hat{H}$ an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian. We provide closed formulas for $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$ and show how we can efficiently describe group multiplications in the double cover without the need of going to a faithful representation on an exponentially large or even infinite-dimensional space. Our construction relies on an explicit parametrization of these two groups (metaplectic, spin) in terms of symplectic and orthogonal group elements together with a twisted U(1) group.</description>

      <title>High stability 2D electron gases formed in Si3N4/Al//KTaO3 heterostructures: synthesis and in-depth interfacial characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) found in KTaO3-based interfaces has garnered attention due to its remarkable electronic properties. In this study, we investigated the conducting system embedded at the Si3N4/Al//KTO(110) heterostructure. We demonstrate that the Al/KTO interface supports a conducting system, with the Si3N4 passivation layer acting as a barrier to oxygen diffusion, enabling ex-situ characterization. Our findings reveal that the mobility and carrier density of the system can be tuned by varying the Al layer thickness. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we characterized the structural and chemical composition of the interface. We found that the Al layer fully oxidizes into AlOx, drawing oxygen from the KTaO3 substrate. The oxygen depletion zone extends 3-5 nm into the substrate and correlates to the Al thickness. Heterostructures with thicker Al layers exhibit higher carrier densities but lower mobilities, likely due to interactions with the oxygen vacancies that act as scattering centers. These findings highlight the importance of considering the effect and extent of the oxygen depletion zone when designing and modeling two-dimensional electron systems in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental study on a quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ where spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity was presented [arXiv: 2402.15869], we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz of infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS). We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, to be compared with future experimental results.</description>

      <title>Surface phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional $SU(2)_1$ conformal field theory boundary coupled to a (2+1)-dimensional $Z_2$ bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a (2+1))-dimensional [(2+1)D] quantum spin model in which spin-1/2 ladders are coupled through antiferromagnetic Ising interactions. The model hosts a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)D $Z_2$ universality class from the Haldane phase to the antiferromagnetic Ising ordered phase. We focus on studying the surface properties of three different surface configurations when the Ising couplings are tuned. Different behaviors are found on different surfaces. We find ordinary and two different extraordinary surface critical behaviors (SCBs) at the bulk critical point. The ordinary SCBs belong to the surface universality class of the classical 3D Ising bulk transition. One extraordinary SCBs is induced by the topological properties of the Haldane phase. Another extraordinary SCBs at the bulk critical point is induced by an unconventional surface phase transition where the surface develops an Ising order before the bulk. This surface transition is realized by coupling a (1+1)-dimensional [(1+1)D] $SU(2)_1$ CFT boundary to a (2+1)D bulk with $Z_2$ symmetry. We find that the transition is neither a (1+1)D $Z_2$ transition, expected based on symmetry consideration, nor a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition, violating the previous theoretical prediction. This new surface phase transition and related extraordinary SCBs deserve further analytical and numerical exploration.</description>

      <title>Collisions of false-vacuum bubble walls in a quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate, using nonperturbative methods, the real-time dynamics of small bubbles of "false vacuum" in a quantum spin chain near criticality, where the low-energy physics is described by a relativistic (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. We consider bubbles whose walls are kink and antikink quasiparticle excitations, so that wall collisions are kink-antikink scattering events. To construct these bubbles in the presence of strong correlations, we extend a recently proposed matrix product state (MPS) ansatz for quasiparticle wavepackets. We simulate dynamics within a window of about 1000 spins embedded in an infinite chain at energies of up to about 5 times the mass gap. By choosing the wavepacket width and the bubble size appropriately, we avoid strong lattice effects and observe relativistic kink-antikink collisions. We use the MPS quasiparticle ansatz to detect scattering outcomes. (i) In the Ising model, with transverse and longitudinal fields, we do not observe particle production despite nonintegrability (supporting recent observations of nonthermalizing states in this model). (ii) Switching on an additional interaction, we see production of confined and unconfined particle pairs. We characterize the amount of entanglement generated as a function of energy and time and conclude that our classical simulation methods will ultimately fail as these increase. We anticipate that kink-antikink scattering in 1+1 dimensions will be an instructive benchmark problem for future quantum computers and analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information-Assisted Complete Active Space Optimization (QICAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated active space selection is arguably one of the most challenging and essential aspects of multiconfigurational methods. In this work we propose an effective quantum information-assisted complete active space optimization (QICAS) scheme. What sets QICAS apart from other correlation-based selection schemes is (i) the use of unique measures from quantum information that assess the correlation in electronic structures in an unambiguous and predictive manner, and (ii) an orbital optimization step that minimizes the correlation discarded by the active space approximation. Equipped with these features QICAS yields for smaller correlated molecules sets of optimized orbitals with respect to which the CASCI energy reaches the corresponding CASSCF energy within chemical accuracy. For more challenging systems such as the Chromium dimer, QICAS offers an excellent starting point for CASSCF by greatly reducing the number of iterations required for numerical convergence. Accordingly, our study validates a profound empirical conjecture: the energetically optimal non-active spaces are predominantly those that contain the least entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a domain wall in the ferromagnetic component, resulting in `dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>
