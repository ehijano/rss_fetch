      <title>Flip Distance of Triangulations of Convex Polygons / Rotation Distance of Binary Trees is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flips in triangulations of convex polygons arise in many different settings. They are isomorphic to rotations in binary trees, define edges in the 1-skeleton of the Associahedron and cover relations in the Tamari Lattice.
  The complexity of determining the minimum number of flips that transform one triangulation of a convex point set into another remained a tantalizing open question for many decades. We settle this question by proving that computing shortest flip sequences between triangulations of convex polygons, and therefore also computing the rotation distance of binary trees, is NP-hard.
  For our proof we develop techniques for flip sequences of triangulations whose counterparts were introduced for the study of flip sequences of non-crossing spanning trees by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SODA25] and Bjerkevik, Dorfer, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SoCG26].</description>

      <title>Learning Tangent Bundles and Characteristic Classes with Autoencoder Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that connects multi-chart autoencoders in manifold learning with the classical theory of vector bundles and characteristic classes. Rather than viewing autoencoders as producing a single global Euclidean embedding, we treat a collection of locally trained encoder-decoder pairs as a learned atlas on a manifold. We show that any reconstruction-consistent autoencoder atlas canonically defines transition maps satisfying the cocycle condition, and that linearising these transition maps yields a vector bundle coinciding with the tangent bundle when the latent dimension matches the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This construction provides direct access to differential-topological invariants of the data. In particular, we show that the first Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed from the signs of the Jacobians of learned transition maps, yielding an algorithmic criterion for detecting orientability. We also show that non-trivial characteristic classes provide obstructions to single-chart representations, and that the minimum number of autoencoder charts is determined by the good cover structure of the manifold. Finally, we apply our methodology to low-dimensional orientable and non-orientable manifolds, as well as to a non-orientable high-dimensional image dataset.</description>

      <title>FLIGHT: Fibonacci Lattice-based Inference for Geometric Heading in real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method leverages properties of the 3D solid angle to solve the relevant surface integral using a boundary formulation with rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by \textit{memoizing} (i.e. caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</description>
