      <title>Flow Through Porous Media at the Percolation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low-Reynolds-number fluid flow through a two-dimensional porous medium modeled as a Lorentz gas. Using extensive finite element simulations we fully resolve the flow fields for packing fractions approaching the percolation threshold. Near the percolation transition, we find a power-law scaling of the flow rate versus the pressure drop with an exponent of $\approx 5/2$, which has been predicted earlier by mapping the macroscopic flow to a discrete flow network [Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 1985]. Importantly, we observe a rounding of the scaling behavior at small system sizes, which can be rationalized via a finite-size scaling ansatz. Finally, we show that the distribution of the kinetic energy exhibits a power-law scaling over several decades at small energies, originating from collections of self-similar, viscous eddies in the dead-end-channels. Our results lay the foundation for unraveling critical behavior of complex fluids omnipresent in biological and geophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Subgrid scale modeling of droplet bag breakup in VOF simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mesh-dependency of the breakup of liquid films, including their breakup length scales and resulting drop size distributions, has long been an obstacle inhibiting the computational modeling of large-scale spray systems. With the aim of overcoming this barrier, this work presents a framework for the prediction and modeling of subgrid-thickness liquid film formation and breakup within two-phase simulations using the volume of fluid method. A two-plane interface reconstruction is used to capture the development of liquid films as their thickness decreases below the mesh size. The breakup of the film is predicted with a semi-analytical model that incorporates the film geometry captured through the two-plane reconstruction. The framework is validated against experiments of the bag breakup of a liquid drop at $\text{We}=13.8$ through the comparison of the resulting drop size and velocity distributions. The generated distributions show good agreement with experimental results for drop resolutions as low as 25.6 cells across the initial diameter. The presented framework enables these drop breakup simulations to be performed at a computational cost three orders of magnitude lower than the cost of simulations utilizing adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Colloidal bubble propulsion mediated through viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble-propelled catalytic colloids stand out as a uniquely efficient design for artificial controllable micromachines, but so far lack a general theoretical framework that explains the physics of their propulsion. Here we develop a combined diffusive and hydrodynamic theory of bubble growth near a spherical catalytic colloid, that allows us to explain the underlying mechanism and the influence of environmental and material parameters. We identify two dimensionless groups, related to colloidal activity and the background fluid, that govern a saddle-node bifurcation of the bubble growth dynamics, and calculate the generated flows analytically for both slip and no slip boundary conditions on the bubble. We finish with a discussion of the assumptions and predictions of our model in the context of existing experimental results, and conclude that some of the observed behaviour, notably the ratchet-like gait, stems from peculiarities of the experimental setup rather than fundamental physics of the propulsive mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic instability of shear imposed falling film over a uniformly heated inclined undulated substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear and weakly nonlinear stability analyses of an externally shear-imposed, gravity-driven falling film over a uniformly heated wavy substrate are studied. The longwave asymptotic expansion technique is utilized to formulate a single nonlinear free surface deflection equation. The linear stability criteria for the onset of instability are derived using the normal mode form in the linearized portion of the surface deformation equation. Linear stability theory reveals that the flow-directed sturdy external shear grows the surface wave instability by increasing the net driving force. On the contrary, the upstream-directed imposed shear may reduce the surface mode instability by restricting the gravity-driving force, which has the consequence of weakening the bulk velocity of the liquid film. However, the surface mode can be stabilized/destabilized by increasing the temperature-dependent density/surface-tension variation. Further, the bottom steepness shows dual behaviour on the surface instability depending upon the wavy wall's portion (uphill/downhill). At the downhill portion, the surface wave becomes more unstable than at the bottom substrate's uphill portion. Moreover, the multi-scale method is incorporated to obtain the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in order to study the weakly nonlinear stability, confirming the existence of various flow regions of the liquid film. At any bottom portion (uphill/downhill), the flow-directed external shear expands the super-critical stable zones, which causes an amplification in the nonlinear wave amplitude, and the backflow-directed shear plays a counterproductive role. On the other hand, the super-critical stable region decreases or increases as long as the linear variation of density or surface tension increases with respect to the temperature, whereas the sub-critical unstable region exhibits an inverse trend.</description>

      <title>Effect of Synthetic Jets Actuator Parameters on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Flow Control Performance in a Square Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on the upper and lower surfaces of a square cylinder, achieving effective active flow control. Through DRL-based active flow control (AFC) technology, we significantly reduce the lift and drag coefficients of the square cylinder at Re=100 and Re=500, while completely suppressing vortex shedding in the wake flow field.Additionally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the position and width parameters of the synthetic jets regarding flow control performance. Our observations indicate that positioning the synthetic jets near the trailing edge corners of the square cylinder, as opposed to the leading edge corners, completely suppresses vortex shedding, resulting in more stable controlled flow coefficients, C_D and C_L. When the synthetic jets are positioned at the trailing edge corners, flow control reduces the mean drag coefficient by 14.4% and the standard deviation of the lift coefficient by 86.1% for the baseline flow at Re=100. For the baseline flow at Re=500, flow control reduces the mean drag coefficient by 51.4% and the standard deviation of the lift coefficient by 90.5%. At both Reynolds numbers, vortex shedding in the wake flow field is completely suppressed. Furthermore, using narrower synthetic jets results in a lower reduction rate of the standard deviations of C_D and C_L, while increasing the mean and standard deviation of the mass flow rate of the jets used for flow control. This study provides guidance on optimizing the width and position of synthetic jets for DRL-based active flow control.</description>

      <title>Complex fluid models of mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15652v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several methods in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are based on Madelung's hydrodynamic description of nuclear motion, while the electronic component is treated as a finite-dimensional quantum system. In this context, the quantum potential leads to severe computational challenges and one often seeks to neglect its contribution, thereby approximating nuclear motion as classical. The resulting model couples classical hydrodynamics for the nuclei to the quantum motion of the electronic component, leading to the structure of a complex fluid system. This type of mixed quantum-classical fluid models have also appeared in solvation dynamics to describe the coupling between liquid solvents and the quantum solute molecule. While these approaches represent a promising direction, their mathematical structure requires a certain care. In some cases, challenging higher-order gradients make these equations hardly tractable. In other cases, these models are based on phase-space formulations that suffer from well-known consistency issues. Here, we present a new complex fluid system that resolves these difficulties. Unlike common approaches, the current system is obtained by applying the fluid closure at the level of the action principle of the original phase-space model. As a result, the system inherits a Hamiltonian structure and retains energy/momentum balance. After discussing some of its structural properties and dynamical invariants, we illustrate the model in the case of pure-dephasing dynamics. We conclude by presenting some invariant planar models.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field, which produce a single best estimate without accounting for inherent uncertainties in the data. However, large uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to the use of noisy, sparse, and indirect observations, as well as turbulent flow models. When this uncertainty is overlooked, the accuracy of eddy identification is significantly affected. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic. The framework begins by sampling an ensemble of ocean realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, which considers uncertainty. Traditional eddy diagnostics are then applied to individual realizations, and the corresponding eddy statistics are aggregated from these diagnostic results. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The probabilistic eddy identification precisely characterizes the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations and provides additional insights in comparison to its deterministic counterpart. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of the eddy are both significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, large biases appear when estimating the eddy lifetime using deterministic methods. In contrast, probabilistic eddy identification not only provides a closer estimate but also quantifies the uncertainty in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>

      <title>Decomposing causality into its synergistic, unique, and redundant components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality lies at the heart of scientific inquiry, serving as the fundamental basis for understanding interactions among variables in physical systems. Despite its central role, current methods for causal inference face significant challenges due to nonlinear dependencies, stochastic interactions, self-causation, collider effects, and influences from exogenous factors, among others. While existing methods can effectively address some of these challenges, no single approach has successfully integrated all these aspects. Here, we address these challenges with SURD: Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition of causality. SURD quantifies causality as the increments of redundant, unique, and synergistic information gained about future events from past observations. The formulation is non-intrusive and applicable to both computational and experimental investigations, even when samples are scarce. We benchmark SURD in scenarios that pose significant challenges for causal inference and demonstrate that it offers a more reliable quantification of causality compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Flow Topology Optimization at High Reynolds Numbers Based on Modified Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow topology optimization (ToOpt) based on Darcy's source term is widely used in the field of ToOpt. It has a high degree of freedom and requires no initial configuration, making it suitable for conceptual aerodynamic design. Two problems of ToOpt are addressed in this paper to apply the ToOpt method to high-Reynolds-number turbulent flow. First, the relationship between the minimum magnitude of Darcy's source term needed to model the solid and the characteristic variables of the flow (freestream velocity, length scale and fluid viscosity) at high Reynolds numbers is quantitively studied. A strategy for setting Darcy's source term is then proposed. Second, the modified Launder - Sharma k-e (LSKE) model with modification terms related to Darcy's source is developed. The ToOpt of a low-drag profile in turbulent flow is studied using the new model. The model is validated to reflect the influence of solids on turbulence even at Reynolds numbers as high as one million. Finally, a wall-distance computation method that can recognize the solid modeled by Darcy's source term is developed and integrated into the modified shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The ToOpt of a rotor-like geometry, which is of great importance in aerodynamic design, is conducted using the modified SST model, proving the model's ability to handle the ToOpt of turbomachinery.</description>

      <title>Development of a Generalizable Data-driven Turbulence Model: Conditioned Field Inversion and Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of predicting separated flows with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which are essential for many engineering tasks. Traditional RANS models usually struggle with this task, so recent efforts have focused on data-driven methods such as field inversion and machine learning (FIML) to correct this issue by adjusting the baseline equations. However, these FIML methods often reduce accuracy in attached boundary layers. To address this issue, we developed a "conditioned field inversion" technique. This method adjusts the corrective factor \b{eta} (used by FIML) in the shear-stress transport (SST) model. It multiplies \b{eta} with a shield function f_d that is off in the boundary layer and on elsewhere. This maintains the accuracy of the baseline model for the attached flows. We applied both conditioned and classic field inversion to the NASA hump and a curved backward-facing step (CBFS), creating two datasets. These datasets were used to train two models: SR-CND (from our new method) and SR-CLS (from the traditional method). The SR-CND model matches the SR-CLS model in predicting separated flows in various scenarios, such as periodic hills, the NLR7301 airfoil, the 3D SAE car model, and the 3D Ahmed body, and significantly outperforms the baseline SST model. Importantly, the SR-CND model maintains accuracy in the attached boundary layers, whereas the SR-CLS model does not. Therefore, the proposed method improves separated flow predictions while maintaining the accuracy of the original model for attached flows, offering a better way to create data-driven turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity has been studied using results of numerical simulations, laboratory measurements, solar, solar wind, the Earth's and planets' magnetosphere observations (spacecraft measurements), and the global magnetic observatory network. The spectral data have been compared with the theoretical results based on the distributed chaos notion in the frames of the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology. The transition from magnetohydrodynamics to kinetics in the electron and Hall magnetohydrodynamics, and in a fully kinetic 3D approach, as well as in the solar wind, solar photosphere, and at the special events (reconnections, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, isolated flux tube interchanges, etc.) in the magnetosphere of Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury has been studied using the above-mentioned data. Despite the considerable differences in the physical parameters and scales, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the observational data in the frames of the magneto-inertial range notion. Temporal variability of the magnetic field at Earth's surface under the influence of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and solar wind has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>One-winged butterflies: mode selection for azimuthal magnetorotational instability by thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interplay with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such an interplay has not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of thermal convection and compare the results with our experimental data published before. We show that the critical Hartmann number ($Ha$) for the onset of AMRI is reduced by convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between $m = \pm 1$ instability modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave appear as a ``one-winged butterfly''.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>
