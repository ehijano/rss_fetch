      <title>Defaultable bond liquidity spread estimation: an option-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends an option-theoretic approach to estimate liquidity spreads for corporate bonds. Inspired by Longstaff's equity market framework and subsequent work by Koziol and Sauerbier on risk-free zero-coupon bonds, the model views liquidity as a look-back option. The model accounts for the interplay of risk-free rate volatility and credit risk. A numerical analysis highlights the impact of these factors on the liquidity spread, particularly for bonds with different maturities and credit ratings. The methodology is applied to estimate the liquidity spread for unquoted bonds, with a specific case study on the Republic of Italy's debt, leveraging market data to calibrate model parameters and classify liquid versus illiquid emissions. This approach provides a robust tool for pricing illiquid bonds, emphasizing the importance of marketability in debt security valuation.</description>

      <title>Asset Pricing Model in Markets of Imperfect Information and Subjective Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a closed-form market equilibrium formula consolidating informational imperfections and investors' beliefs about assets. Based on Merton's incomplete information model, we characterize the equilibrium expected excess returns vector with asymmetric information. We then derive the corresponding market portfolio as the solution to a non-linear system of equations, and analyze the sensitivities of each asset's extra excess returns to its shadow-costs and market weight. We derive the market reference model for excess returns under random shadow-costs. The conditional posterior distribution of excess returns integrates the pick-matrix and pick-vector of views and the vector of shadow-costs into a multivariate distribution with mean vector and covariance matrix dependent on the model and structure of the considered market reference.</description>

      <title>Sovereign Debt Default and Climate Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between sovereign debt default/renegotiation and environmental factors (e.g., pollution from land use, natural resource exploitation). Pollution contributes to the likelihood of natural disasters and influences economic growth rates. The country can default on its debt at any time while also deciding whether to invest in pollution abatement. The framework provides insights into the credit spreads of sovereign bonds and explains the observed relationship between bond spread and a country's climate vulnerability. Through calibration for developing and low-income countries, we demonstrate that there is limited incentive for these countries to address climate risk, and the sensitivity of bond spreads to climate vulnerability remains modest. Climate risk does not play a relevant role on the decision to default on sovereign debt. Financial support for climate abatement expenditures can effectively foster climate adaptation actions, instead renegotiation conditional upon pollution abatement does not produce any effect.</description>

      <title>Multivariate L\'evy models: calibration and pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate how the marginal and dependence structures of a variety of multivariate L\'evy models affect calibration and pricing. To this aim, we study the approaches of Luciano and Semeraro (2010) and Ballotta and Bonfiglioli (2016) to construct multivariate processes. We explore several calibration methods that can be used to fine-tune the models, and that deal with the observed trade-off between marginal and correlation fit. We carry out a thorough empirical analysis to evaluate the ability of the models to fit market data, price exotic derivatives, and embed a rich dependence structure. By merging theoretical aspects with the results of the empirical test, we provide tools to make suitable decisions about the models and calibration techniques to employ in a real context.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) is covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximations, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debt. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>
