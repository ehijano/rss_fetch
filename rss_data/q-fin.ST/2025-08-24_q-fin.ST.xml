      <title>Asymmetric super-Heston-rough volatility model with Zumbach effect as scaling limit of quadratic Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawkes processes were first introduced to obtain microscopic models for the rough volatility observed in asset prices. Scaling limits of such processes leads to the rough-Heston model that describes the macroscopic behavior. Blanc et al. (2017) show that Time-reversal asymmetry (TRA) or the Zumbach effect can be modeled using Quadratic Hawkes (QHawkes) processes. Dandapani et al. (2021) obtain a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limit of QHawkes processes in the case where the impact of buying and selling actions are symmetric. To model asymmetry in buying and selling actions, we propose a bivariate QHawkes process and derive a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limits for the price process in the stable and near-unstable regimes that preserves TRA. A new feature of the limiting process in the near-unstable regime is that the two driving Brownian motions exhibit a stochastic covariation that depends on the spot volatility.</description>

      <title>Slomads Rising: Stay Length Shifts in Digital Nomad Travel, United States 2019-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using all U.S. Airbnb reservations created in 2019-2024 (booking-count weighted), we quantify pandemic-era shifts in nights per booking (NPB) and the mechanism behind them. The mean rose from 3.68 pre-COVID to 4.36 during restrictions and stabilized near 4.07 post-2021 (about 10% above 2019); the booking-weighted median moved from 2 to 3 nights. A two-parameter log-normal fits best by wide AIC/BIC margins, indicating heavy tails. A negative-binomial model with month effects implies post-vaccine bookings are 6.5% shorter than restriction-era bookings, while pre-COVID bookings are 16% shorter. In a two-part model at 28 nights, the booking share of month-plus stays rose from 1.43% (pre) to 2.72% (restriction) and settled at 2.04% (post); conditional means among long stays were about 55-60 nights. Thus the higher average reflects more long stays rather than longer long stays. A SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 with pandemic-phase dummies improves fit (LR=8.39, df=2, p=0.015), consistent with a structural level shift.</description>
