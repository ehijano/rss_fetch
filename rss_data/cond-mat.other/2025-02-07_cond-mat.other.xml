      <title>A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of the diverse incident angle performance of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface in a reverberation chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental validation results of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface that behaves differently according to the incoming waveform, more specifically, the incoming pulse width, even at a fixed frequency. This waveform-selective behavior is integrated with an antenna design to preferentially accept a predetermined incoming waveform while rejecting another waveform at the same frequency. In particular, we report how the waveform-selective antenna performance can be evaluated for diverse incident angles, which is enabled by a measurement method based on a reverberation chamber. This method facilitates variation of the electromagnetic fields and modes inside the chamber and mimicking of complicated wireless communication environments through rotation of the internal stirrer. The experimental results verify that our antenna design concept based on waveform-selective metasurfaces can filter different signals with a wide range of incident angles, opening the door to utilizing such pulse-width-dependent antennas to suppress electromagnetic noise in more realistic wireless communication environments.</description>

      <title>Crystal tensor properties of magnetic materials with and without spin-orbit coupling. Application of spin point groups as approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin space groups, formed by operations where the rotation of the spins is independent of the accompanying operation acting on the crystal structure, are appropriate groups to describe the symmetry of magnetic structures with null spin-orbit coupling. Their corresponding spin point groups are the symmetry groups to be considered for deriving the symmetry constraints on the form of the crystal tensor properties of such idealized structures. These groups can also be taken as approximate symmetries (with some restrictions) of real magnetic structures, where spin-orbit and magnetic anisotropy are however present. Here we formalize the invariance transformation properties that must satisfy the most important crystal tensors under a spin point group. This is done using modified Jahn symbols, which generalize those applicable to ordinary magnetic point groups [Gallego et al., Acta Cryst. (2019) A{\bf 75}, 438-447]. The analysis includes not only equilibrium tensors, but also transport, optical and non-linear optical susceptibility tensors. The constraints imposed by spin collinearity and coplanarity within the spin group formalism on a series of representative tensors are discussed and compiled. As illustrative examples, the defined tensor invariance equations have been applied to some known magnetic structures, showing the differences of the symmetry-adapted form of some relevant tensors, when considered under the constraints of its spin point group or its magnetic point group. This comparison, with the spin point group implying additional constraints in the tensor form, may allow to distinguish those magnetic-related properties that can be solely attributed to spin-orbit coupling from those that are expected to be present even under negligible spin-orbit effects.</description>

      <title>Octagonal tilings with three prototiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretically and experimentally observed structural phases with octagonal symmetry, we introduce a family of octagonal tilings which are composed of three prototiles. We define our tilings with respect to two non-negative integers, $m$ and $n$, so that the inflation factor of a given tiling is $\delta_{(m,n)}=m+n (1+\sqrt{2})$. As such, we show that our family consists of an infinite series of tilings which can be delineated into separate `cases' which are determined by the relationship between $m$ and $n$. Similarly, we present the primitive substitution rules or decomposition of our prototiles, along with the statistical properties of each case, demonstrating their dependence on these integers.</description>

      <title>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</description>
