      <title>Effect of polarization on spectroscopic characterization of laser produced aluminium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a well-established technique widely used in fundamental research and diverse practical fields. Polarization-resolved LIBS, a variant of this technique, aims to improve the sensitivity, which is a critical aspect in numerous scientific domains. In our recent work we demonstrated that the degree of polarization (DOP) in the emission depends on the spatial location and time in a nano second laser generated aluminium plasma1. Present study investigates the effect of polarized emission on the estimation of plasma parameters. The plasma parameters are estimated using the conventional spectroscopic methods such as Boltzmann plot and line intensity ratio for the estimation of electron temperature and Stark broadening for estimating the electron density. The estimated plasma temperature using Boltzmann plot method shows large errors in electron temperature for the locations where DOP is higher. However, the electron density estimated using the Stark width does not show such variation. The observed ambiguity in temperature estimation using the Boltzmann plot method appears to be a consequence of deviation from expected Maxwell Boltzmann distribution of population of the involved energy levels. These findings highlight the need of assessing the DOP of the plasma before selecting the polarization for PRLIBS or temperature estimation using Boltzmann plots in elemental analysis.</description>

      <title>Effect of ambient on the dynamics of re-deposition in the rear laser ablation of a thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report an innovative pump-probe based experimental set up, to study the melting, subsequent evaporation, plasma formation and redeposition in a thin film coated on a glass substrate under different ambient conditions and laser fluences. The ambient conditions restrict the expansion of the plasma plume. At high ambient pressure, plume expansion stops closer to the substrate and get re-deposited at the site of the ablation. This helps in the identification of multiple processes and their temporal evolutions during the melting, expansion and re-deposition stages. The ambient conditions affect the plasma plume formed upon ablation, thus modulating the transmission of probe laser pulses, which provides information about the plume dynamics. Further, the study offers valuable insights into the laser-based ablation of thin film coatings, which will have implications in in situ cleaning of view ports on large experimental facilities such as tokamaks and other systems e.g. coating units, pulsed laser deposition, Laser induced forward transfer, Laser surface structuring, etc.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear resonant interactions of radiation belt electrons with intense whistler-mode waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Earth's outer radiation belt, filled by energetic electron fluxes, is largely controlled by electron resonant interactions with electromagnetic whistler-mode waves. The most coherent and intense waves resonantly interact with electrons nonlinearly, and the observable effects of such nonlinear interactions cannot be described within the frame of classical quasi-linear models. This paper provides an overview of the current stage of the theory of nonlinear resonant interactions and discusses different possible approaches for incorporating these nonlinear interactions into global radiation belt simulations. We focused on observational properties of whistler-mode waves and theoretical aspects of electron nonlinear resonant interactions between such waves and energetic electrons.</description>

      <title>On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization of intense laser pulses in hollow cores of ionized nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local field enhancement occurring in laser-nanostructure interaction is of wide interest due to its potential application in nonlinear optics and strong-field physics. Here we demonstrate through particle-in-cell simulations a non-resonant field enhancement in hollow cores of ionized nanotubes. Surface plasmon polariton is excited in ionized nanotubes by the laser pulse, producing a back-scattered longitudinal field. This field interferes with the incoming field, and the phase shift of two fields induces an axial converging energy flow. The resulting concentrated energy is coupled into the waveguide formed by the tubular plasma and propagates with a reasonable loss. The field enhancement is sensitive to the inner radius and survives for a range of plasma densities. This enhanced field is almost homogeneous in a nanometer-sized volume and may facilitate high-field measurement with subwavelength spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Analysis of high-field side plasma instabilities in tokamak edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balanced double-null configurations are of general interest for boundary plasma physics, and they have been proposed for some future designs. Experimental observations demonstrate absence of plasma fluctuations in tokamak high-field side scrape-off layer in a balanced double-null configuration [Smick et al 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 023001], and it is commonly assumed that plasma instabilities are suppressed on high-field side in the edge plasma due to the stabilizing effect of magnetic curvature. At the same time, the experimental evidence points to extremely steep plasma density profiles on high-field side, which should provide a strong instability drive. In the present study, the drift-resistive-ballooning mode instability model is investigated analytically and numerically to determine the characteristics of plasma instabilities, turbulence, and transport in tokamak scrape-off layer on high-field side.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive research in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing structure-preserving integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Proton-Beam-Driven Instabilities from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic non-thermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton Velocity Distribution Functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam populations that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton-beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Energetic Electron Fluxes from 150 km to 20,000 km: an ELFIN-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong variations of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere are notoriously hard to forecast. Developing accurate empirical models of electron fluxes from low to high altitudes at all latitudes is therefore useful to improve our understanding of flux variations and to assess radiation hazards for spacecraft systems. In the present work, energy- and pitch-angle-resolved precipitating, trapped, and backscattered electron fluxes measured at low altitude by Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) CubeSats are used to infer omnidirectional fluxes at altitudes below and above the spacecraft, from 150 km to 20,000 km, making use of adiabatic transport theory and quasi-linear diffusion theory. The inferred fluxes are fitted as a function of selected parameters using a stepwise multivariate optimization procedure, providing an analytical model of omnidirectional electron flux along each geomagnetic field line, based on measurements from only one spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The modeled electron fluxes are provided as a function of $L$-shell, altitude, energy, and two different indices of past substorm activity, computed over the preceding 4 hours or 3 days, potentially allowing to disentangle impulsive processes (such as rapid injections) from cumulative processes (such as inward radial diffusion and wave-driven energization). The model is validated through comparisons with equatorial measurements from the Van Allen Probes, demonstrating the broad applicability of the present method. The model indicates that both impulsive and time-integrated substorm activity partly control electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt and in the plasma sheet.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>
