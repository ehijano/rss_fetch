      <title>Exploiting the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Determining Ground State Energy of Protocatechuic Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising hybrid algorithm, utilizing both quantum and classical computers to obtain the ground state energy of molecules. In this context, this study applies VQE to investigate the ground state of protocatechuic acid, analyzing its performance with various Ans\"atze and active spaces. Subsequently, all VQE results were compared to those obtained with the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The results demonstrate that Ans\"atze, like unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) and variations of Hardware-Efficient, generally achieve accuracy close to that of HF. Furthermore, the increase in active space has led to the models becoming more difficult to converge to values with a greater distance from the correct energy. In summary, the findings of this study reinforce the use of VQE as a powerful tool for analyzing molecular ground state energies. Finally, the results underscore the critical importance of Ansatz selection and active space size in VQE performance, providing valuable insights into its potential and limitations.</description>

      <title>Calculated state-of-the art results for solvation and ionization energies of thousands of organic molecules relevant to battery design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-quality reference data for two fundamentally important groups of molecular properties related to a compound's utility as a lithium battery electrolyte. The first one is energy changes associated with charge excitations of molecules, namely ionization potential and electron affinity. They were estimated for 7000 randomly chosen molecules with up to 9 non-hydrogen atoms C, N, O, and F (QM9 dataset) using DH-HF, DF-HF-CABS, PNO-LMP2-F12, and PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 methods as implemented in Molpro software with aug-cc-pVTZ basis set; additionally, we provide the corresponding atomization energies at these levels of theory, as well as CPU time and disk space used during the calculations. The second one is solvation energies for 39 different solvents, which we estimate for 18361 molecules connected to battery design (Electrolyte Genome Project dataset), 309463 randomly chosen molecules with up to 17 non-hydrogen atoms C, N, O, S, and halogens (GDB17 dataset), as well as 88418 amons of ZINC database of commercially available compounds and 37772 amons of GDB17. For these calculations we used the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) method; we additionally provide estimates of gas-phase atomization energies, as well as information about conformers considered during the COSMO-RS calculations, namely coordinates, energies, and dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Decoherence dynamics in molecular qubits: Exponential, Gaussian and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine how the structure of system-bath interactions can determine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian and exponential decay, in molecular qubits coupled to a thermal nuclear environment. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits analytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely Gaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions, with periods determined by the environment's frequencies. For initially unentangled qubit-bath states, or for those where the initial entanglement arises due to displacement in the position of the bath states, Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes increasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit-environment interaction strength, and the environment's correlation time. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very specific models that we isolate. Still, it becomes dominant for times longer than the environment correlation time or for early times when there is initial entanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. Further, we discuss the connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic spectroscopic lineshape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to Gaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential coherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with inhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from system-bath entanglement even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly reparametrization of pairwise dispersion interactions for accurate and efficient molecular dynamics: Phase diagram of white phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the contribution from dispersion interactions to the total energy is important for many molecular systems and low-dimensional solids. In this work we demonstrate how the recently developed linear-scaling many-body dispersion correction method can be efficiently applied in molecular dynamics simulations while keeping high accuracy. This is achieved by reparametrization of the effective pairwise dispersion interactions on the fly during the simulation. We demonstrate this method by computing order-disorder and solid-liquid transitions of the phase diagram of white phosphorus (P$_4$).</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fock build via hybrid analytical-numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very robust and efficient hybrid analytic-numerical Fock build, aMECP+aCOSx, has been developed for accelerating HF/DFT calculations. The essential idea is to extract those portions of the Fock matrix that can readily be evaluated analytically, so as to minimize numerical noises arising from the semi-numerical and numerical integrations. As a result, the combination of aMECP with a medium grid and aCOSx with a coarse grid is already sufficient to achieve an accuracy of less than 1{\mu}Eh/atom in total energies. The acceleration of aMECP+aCOSx over the analytic Fock build is already seen in calculations of small molecular systems and is more enhanced in calculations of large molecules with extended basis sets.</description>

      <title>Spin migration in density functional theory: energy, potential and density perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flip, magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, the KS potentials and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze five standard exchange-correlation functionals and find three main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, and the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>The Role of Interfaces and Charge for Chemical Reactivity in Microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of reactions are reported to be dramatically accelerated in aqueous microdroplets, making them a promising platform for environmentally clean chemical synthesis. However to fully utilize the microdroplets for accelerating chemical reactions requires a fundamental understanding of how microdroplet chemistry differs from that of a homogeneous phase. Here we provide our perspective on recent progress to this end both experimentally and theoretically. We begin by reviewing the many ways in which microdroplets can be prepared, creating water/hydrophobic interfaces which have been frequently implicated in microdroplet reactivity due to preferential surface adsorption of solutes, persistent electric fields, and their acidity or basicity. These features of the interface interplay with specific mechanisms proposed for microdroplet reactivity, including partial solvation and possible gas phase channels. We especially highlight the role of droplet charge, which appears key to understanding how certain reactions, like the formation of hydrogen peroxide and reduced transition metal complexes, are thermodynamically possible in microdroplets. Lastly, we emphasize opportunities for theoretical advances in the microdroplet field generally, and to suggest experiments which would greatly enhance our understanding of this fascinating and emerging subject.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Coherent Electron Motion in a Photoionized Aromatic Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular systems, the ultrafast motion of electrons initiates the process of chemical change. Tracking this electronic motion across molecules requires coupling attosecond time resolution to atomic-scale spatial sensitivity. In this work, we employ a pair of attosecond x-ray pulses from an x-ray free-electron laser to follow electron motion resulting from the sudden removal of an electron from a prototypical aromatic system, para-aminophenol. X-ray absorption enables tracking this motion with atomic-site specificity. Our measurements are compared with state-of-the-art computational modeling, reproducing the observed response across multiple timescales. Sub-femtosecond dynamics are assigned to states undergoing non-radiative decay, while few-femtosecond oscillatory motion is associated with electronic wavepacket motion in stable cation states, that will eventually couple to nuclear motion. Our work provides insight on the ultrafast charge motion preceding and initiating chemical transformations in moderately complex systems, and provides a powerful benchmark for computational models of ultrafast charge motion in matter.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Adapted Residual Neural Network Diabatization: Conical Intersections in Aniline Photodissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symmetry adapted residual neural network (SAResNet) diabatization method to construct quasi-diabatic Hamiltonians that accurately represent ab initio adiabatic energies, energy gradients, and nonadiabatic couplings for moderate sized systems. Our symmetry adapted neural network inherits from the pioneering symmetry adapted polynomial and fundamental invariant neural network diabatization methods to exploit the power of neural network along with the transparent symmetry adaptation of polynomial for both symmetric and asymmetric irreducible representations. In addition, our symmetry adaptation provides a unified framework for symmetry adapted polynomial and symmetry adapted neural network, enabling the adoption of the residual neural network architecture, which is a powerful descendant of the pioneering feedforward neural network. Our SAResNet is applied to construct the full 36-dimensional coupled diabatic potential energy surfaces for aniline N-H bond photodissociation, with 2,269 data points and 32,640 trainable parameters and 190 cm-1 root mean square deviation in energy. In addition to the experimentally observed {\pi}{\pi}* and {\pi}Rydberg/{\pi}{\sigma}* states, a higher state (HOMO - 1 {\pi} to Rydberg/{\sigma}* excitation) is found to introduce an induced geometric phase effect thus indirectly participate in the photodissociation process.</description>

      <title>Exploring Different Search Approaches to Discover Donor Molecules for Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying organic molecules with desirable properties from the extensive chemical space can be challenging, particularly when property evaluation methods are time-consuming and resource intensive. In this study, we illustrate this challenge by exploring the chemical space of large oligomers, constructed from monomeric building blocks, for potential use in organic photovoltaics (OPV). To facilitate this exploration, we developed a Python package called stk-search, which employs a building block approach. For this purpose, we developed a python package to search the chemical space using a building block approach: stk-search. We use stk-search (GitHub link) to compare a variety of search algorithms, including those based upon Bayesian optimization and evolutionary approaches. Initially, we evaluated and compared the performance of different search algorithms within a precomputed search space. We then extended our investigation to the vast chemical space of molecules formed of 6 building blocks (6-mers), comprising over $10^{14}$ molecules. Notably, while some algorithms show only marginal improvements over a random search approach in a relatively small, precomputed, search space, their performance in the larger chemical space is orders of magnitude better. Specifically, Bayesian optimization identified a thousand times more promising molecules with the desired properties compared to random search, using the same computational resources.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02224v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants are key ingredients in foaming and cleansing products across various industries such as personal and home care, industrial cleaning, and more, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) being of major interest. Predictive models for CMC of pure surfactants have been developed based on recent ML methods, however, in practice surfactant mixtures are typically used due to to performance, environmental, and cost reasons. This requires accounting for synergistic/antagonistic interactions between surfactants; however, predictive ML models for a wide spectrum of mixtures are missing so far. Herein, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) framework for surfactant mixtures to predict the temperature-dependent CMC. We collect data for 108 surfactant binary mixtures, to which we add data for pure species from our previous work [Brozos et al. (2024), J. Chem. Theory Comput.]. We then develop and train GNNs and evaluate their accuracy across different prediction test scenarios for binary mixtures relevant to practical applications. The final GNN models demonstrate very high predictive performance when interpolating between different mixture compositions and for new binary mixtures with known species. Extrapolation to binary surfactant mixtures where either one or both surfactant species are not seen before, yields accurate results for the majority of surfactant systems. We further find superior accuracy of the GNN over a semi-empirical model based on activity coefficients, which has been widely used to date. We then explore if GNN models trained solely on binary mixture and pure species data can also accurately predict the CMCs of ternary mixtures. Finally, we experimentally measure the CMC of 4 commercial surfactants that contain up to four species and industrial relevant mixtures and find a very good agreement between measured and predicted CMC values.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Density Functional Theory for Static Correlation in Large Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge for density functional theory (DFT) in practice is its limited ability to treat static electron correlation, leading to errors in its prediction of charges, multiradicals, and reaction barriers. Recently, we combined one- and two-electron reduced density matrix theories with DFT to obtain a universal $O(N^3)$ generalization of DFT for static correlation. In this Letter, we enhance the theory's treatment of large molecules by renormalizing the trace of the two-electron identity matrix in the correction using Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities of the electron-electron repulsion matrix. We apply the resulting functional theory to linear hydrogen chains as well as the prediction of the singlet-triplet gap and equilibrium geometries of a series of acenes. This renormalization of the generalized DFT retains the $O(N^{3})$ computational scaling of DFT while enabling the accurate treatment of static correlation for a broad range of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Towards Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift is due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity and thus accuracy compared to PEET, core-loss thermometry still has important advantages. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex materials. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion unless the temperature-dependent effective mass and dielectric constant are known. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>

Abstract: The formation of Li$_2^+$ and subsequently Li$^+$ ions, during the excitation of $^7$Li atoms to the $3S_{1/2}$ state in a $^7$Li magneto optical trap (MOT), is probed in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Associative ionization occurs during the collision of Li($2P_{3/2}$) and Li($3S_{1/2}$) ultracold atoms, creating Li$_2^+$ ions. Photodissociation of Li$_2^+$ by the MOT lasers is an active channel for the conversion of Li$_2^+$ to Li$^+$. A fraction of the Li$_2^+$ ions is long lived even in the presence of MOT light. Additionally, rapid formation of Li$^+$ from Li$_2^+$ in the absence of MOT light is observed. Resonant excitation of ultracold atoms, resulting in intricate molecular dynamics, reveals important processes in ultracold dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Controlled Delivery of Reactive Oxygen Species by Functionalized Catalytic Plasma Coatings for Antimicrobial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.</description>

      <title>TDS Simulator: A MATLAB App to model temperature-programmed hydrogen desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TDS Simulator, a new software tool aimed at modelling thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments. TDS is a widely used technique for quantifying key characteristics of hydrogen-material interactions, such as diffusivity and trapping. However, interpreting the output of TDS experiments is non-trivial and requires appropriate post-processing tools. This work introduces the first software tool capable of simulating TDS curves for arbitrary choices of material parameters and hydrogen trap characteristics, using the primary hydrogen diffusion and trapping models (Oriani, McNabb-Foster). Moreover, TDS Simulator contains a specific functionality for loading experimental TDS data and conducting the inverse calibration of a selected transport model, providing automatic estimates of the density and binding energy of each hydrogen trap type in the material. In its first version, TDS Simulator is provided as a MATLAB App, which is made freely available to the community and provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make use of TDS Simulator straightforward. As reported in the present manuscript, the outputs of TDS Simulator have been extensively validated against literature data. Demonstrations of automatic determination of trap characteristics from experimental data through the optimisation tool are also provided. The present work enables an efficient and straightforward characterisation of hydrogen-material characteristics relevant to multiple applications, from nuclear fusion to the development of hydrogen-compatible materials for the hydrogen economy. TDS Simulator can be downloaded from https://mechmat.web.ox.ac.uk/codes.</description>

      <title>Pyridyl-functionalized tripod molecules on Au(111): Interplay between H-bonding and metal coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-assembly of pyridyl-functionalized triazine (T4PT) was studied on Au(111) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultra-high vacuum conditions combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, we investigated the effect of temperature on the intermolecular interactions within the assemblies. STM measurements revealed that T4PT molecules form a well-ordered, close-packed structure, with the molecules adopting a planar conformation parallel to the Au surface for coverages $\leq1$ monolayer upon room temperature deposition. The intermolecular interactions stabilizing the self-assembled arrangement is based on a combination of hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals forces. Upon post-deposition annealing, the assemblies are additionally stabilized by metal-ligand bonding between the pyridyl ligands and native Au adatoms. Further post-deposition annealing at temperatures above $200^{\circ}$C led to the breaking of the N-Au bonds with the molecular assemblies transforming into a second close-packed hydrogen bonded structure. For temperatures exceeding $230^{\circ}$C, few covalently linked dimers formed, most likely as a result of CH-bond activation. We rationalize the kinetically-driven structure formation by unveiling the interaction strengths of the bonding motifs using DFT and compare the molecular conformation to the structurally similar pyridyl-functionalized benzene (T4PB).</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Molecular Language Models with Random Functional Group Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of trans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast amount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to understand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in fields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry, 2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In this paper, we propose \ours{} -- a SMILES-based \underline{\em M}olecular \underline{\em L}anguage \underline{\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES subsequences corresponding to specific molecular \underline{\em F}unctional \underline{\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the pre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the robustness and superiority of \ours{}. Our findings reveal that \ours{} outperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in 9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining ones.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground state preparation in ab initio electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative engineering is a powerful tool for quantum state preparation, and has drawn significant attention in quantum algorithms and quantum many-body physics in recent years. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using the Lindblad dynamics to efficiently prepare the ground state for general ab initio electronic structure problems on quantum computers, without variational parameters. These problems often involve Hamiltonians that lack geometric locality or sparsity structures, which we address by proposing two generic types of jump operators for the Lindblad dynamics. Type-I jump operators break the particle number symmetry and should be simulated in the Fock space. Type-II jump operators preserves the particle number symmetry and can be simulated more efficiently in the full configuration interaction space. For both types of jump operators, we prove that in a simplified Hartree-Fock framework, the spectral gap of our Lindbladian is lower bounded by a universal constant. For physical observables such as energy and reduced density matrices, the convergence rate of our Lindblad dynamics with Type-I jump operators remains universal, while the convergence rate with Type-II jump operators only depends on coarse grained information such as the number of orbitals and the number of electrons. To validate our approach, we employ a Monte Carlo trajectory-based algorithm for simulating the Lindblad dynamics for full ab initio Hamiltonians, demonstrating its effectiveness on molecular systems amenable to exact wavefunction treatment.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in KNbO3: symmetry analysis and first principles calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group theoretical aspects of the three temperature-dependent and temperature-reversible experimentally observed phase transitions in the KNbO3 crystal (cubic-tetragonal, tetragonal-orthorhombic, orthorhombic-rhombohedral) in the framework of the group-subgroup relationship tree have been discussed. The ab initio DFT-HSE06 LCAO calculations of the electron and phonon properties, with optimisation of lattice parameters and atomic coordinates for all experimentally observed KNbO3 phases, are used for better understanding of the details of these phase transitions. Good agreement with the experimental data was found for the structural properties. Ab initio calculations of the phonon dispersion curves confirmed the existence of a stable phase only for the rhombohedral structure found experimentally for the lowest temperature of 263 K. For the remaining three higher temperature phases, imaginary frequencies appear, implying a nonstability of these phases. The only the cubic-tetragonal phase transition has been found to be symmetry allowed. The tetragonal-orthorhombic and orthorhombic-rhombohedral phases are not related to the group-subgroup relationship. An explanation is proposed based also on the results of ab initio calculations of the structure of the monoclinic phase, which we have chosen as a virtual one for the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rational design of next-generation functional materials relied on quantitative predictions of their electronic structures beyond single building blocks. First-principles quantum mechanical (QM) modeling became infeasible as the size of a material grew beyond hundreds of atoms. In this study, we developed a new computational tool integrating fragment-based graph neural networks (FBGNN) into the fragment-based many-body expansion (MBE) theory, referred to as FBGNN-MBE, and demonstrated its capacity to reproduce full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (FD-PES) for hierarchic chemical systems with manageable accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. In particular, we divided the entire system into basic building blocks (fragments), evaluated their single-fragment energies using a first-principles QM model and attacked many-fragment interactions using the structure-property relationships trained by FBGNNs. Our development of FBGNN-MBE demonstrated the potential of a new framework integrating deep learning models into fragment-based QM methods, and marked a significant step towards computationally aided design of large functional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-solid-state batteries hold great promise for electric vehicle applications due to their enhanced safety and higher energy density. However, further performance optimization requires a deeper understanding of their degradation mechanisms, particularly at the nanoscale. This study investigates the real-time degradation processes of an oxide-based all-solid-state micro-battery, using focused ion beam lamellae composed of LAGP as the solid electrolyte, LiFePO4 (LFP) composite as the positive electrode, and LiVPO4 (LVP) composite as the negative electrode. In situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed critical degradation phenomena, including the formation of cracks along grain boundaries in the solid electrolyte due to lithium diffusion and mechanical stress. Additionally, the shrinkage of solid electrolyte particles and the formation of amorphous phases were observed. These findings highlight the importance of grain boundary dynamics and amorphization in the performance of solid electrolytes and provide insights into degradation mechanisms that can inform the design of more durable all-solid-state batteries.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for understanding complex physical, chemical, and biological processes at the atomic level. However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative deep learning has become pivotal in molecular design for drug discovery and materials science. A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method with self-improvement learning from language modeling, allowing stable fine-tuning of deep transformers with many layers. We evaluate GraphXForm on two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, showing that it outperforms four state-of-the-art molecular design techniques, while it can flexibly enforce structural constraints or initiate the design from existing molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for thermochemical nonequilibrium gas mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-specific thermochemical collisional models are crucial to accurately describe the physics of systems involving nonequilibrium plasmas, but they are also computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale, multi-dimensional simulations. Historically, computational cost has been mitigated by using empirical and physics-based arguments to reduce the complexity of the governing equations. However, the resulting models are often inaccurate and they fail to capture the important features of the original physics. Additionally, the construction of these models is often impractical, as it requires extensive user supervision and time-consuming parameter tuning. In this paper, we address these issues through an easily-implementable and computationally-efficient model reduction pipeline based on the Petrov-Galerkin projection of the nonlinear kinetic equations. Our approach is justified by the observation that kinetic systems in thermal nonequilibrium tend to exhibit low-rank dynamics that rapidly drive the state towards a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear nature of the governing equations, we observe that the dynamics of these systems evolve on subspaces that can be accurately identified using the linearized equations about thermochemical equilibrium, which significantly reduce the cost associated with the construction of the model. The approach is demonstrated on a rovibrational collisional model for the O$_2$-O system, and a vibrational collisional model for the combined O$_2$-O and O$_2$-O$_2$ systems. Our method achieves high accuracy, with relative errors of less than 1% for macroscopic quantities (i.e., moments) and 10% for microscopic quantities (i.e., energy levels population), while also delivering excellent compression rates and speedups, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

Abstract: Single-molecule junctions - nanoscale systems where a molecule is connected to metallic electrodes - offer a unique platform for studying charge, spin and energy transport in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems, with few parallels in other areas of condensed matter physics. Over the past decades, these systems have revealed a wide range of remarkable quantum phenomena, including quantum interference, non-equilibrium spin-crossover, diode-like behavior, or chiral-induced spin selectivity, among many others. To develop a detailed understanding, it turned out essential to have available ab initio-based tools for accurately describing quantum transport in such systems. They need to be capable of capturing the intricate electronic structure of molecules, sometimes in the presence of electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions, in out-of-equilibrium environments. Such tools are indispensable also for experimentally observed phenomena explained in terms of parametrized tight-binding models for the quantum transport problem. While FHI-aims also offers specialized transport routines, e.g. for chemically functionalized nanotubes or nanotube networks, our focus in this section is on the AITRANSS package designed for simulations of single-molecule transport. AITRANSS is an independent post-processing tool that combined with FHI-aims enables the calculation of electronic transport properties, as well as atom-projected density of states, spin properties and the simulation of scanning tunneling microscope images in molecular junctions. Pilot versions of the code extend some of these capabilities to non-linear transport in the applied bias, with plans to include these features in future releases of the package.</description>

Abstract: The random batch method is advantageous in accelerating force calculations in particle simulations, but it poses a challenge of removing the artificial heating effect in application to the Langevin dynamics. We develop an approach to solve this issue by estimating the force variance, resulting in a variance-reduced random batch Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows the high-order local truncation error of the time step in the numerical discretization scheme, in consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Numerical results indicate that the method can achieve a significant variance reduction since a smaller batch size provides accurate approximation, demonstrating the attractive feature of the variance-reduced random batch method for Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14485v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microheterogeneity, as a fundamental natural property, is widely presented in a range of microscopic systems such as polymer systems, biomacromolecular systems, and nanosystems, however, the construction of molecular systems of this form has not yet been realized at the level of organic molecules with well-defined structural compositions. Inspired by the "chemical space" concept, I recently reported a study of the single molecule mixture state, In this preprint, a detailed discussion of microheterogeneity and the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Multi-Criteria Decision Making in Chemical and Process Engineering: Methods, Progress and Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is necessary for choosing one from the available alternatives (or from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization), where the performance of each alternative is quantified against several criteria (or objectives). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of MCDM methods in chemical and process engineering. It systematically outlines the essential steps in MCDM, including the various normalization, weighting, and MCDM methods that are critical to the decision-making. The review draws on published papers identified through a search in the SCOPUS database, focusing on works by authors with more contributions to the field. Each selected paper is analyzed based on the MCDM, normalization and weighting methods used. Additionally, this paper introduces two readily available programs for performing MCDM calculations. In short, it provides insights into MCDM steps and methods, highlights their applications in chemical engineering, and discusses the challenges and prospects in this area.</description>

      <title>Capturing the elusive curve-crossing in low-lying states of butadiene with dressed TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A striking example of the need to accurately capture states of double-excitation character in molecules is seen in predicting photo-induced dynamics in small polyenes. Due to the coupling of electronic and nuclear motions,the dark 2$^1$Ag state, known to have double-excitation character, can be reached after an initial photo-excitation to the bright $^1$Bu state via crossings of their potential energy surfaces. However, the shapes of the surfaces are so poorly captured by most electronic structure methods, that the crossing is missed or substantially mis-located. We demonstrate that the frequency-dependent kernel of dressed TDDFT beyond Tamm-Dancoff successfully captures the curve-crossing, providing an energy surface close to the highly accurate but more expensive $\delta$-CR-EOMCC(2,3) benchmark reference. This, along with its accurate prediction of the excitation character of the state makes dressed TDDFT a practical and accurate route to electronic structure quantities needed in modeling ultrafast dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>Description of the condensed phases of water in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that the reason why many properties of water are notoriously at odds with current models is the low dissociation energy of the H-bond, which leads to the instability of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Bose-Einstein condensation at the gas-liquid transition stabilizes the H-bond and opens the door to a reasoning from the laws of quantum mechanics to classical physics, explaining the properties of the condensed phases with only four observables and no arbitrary hypotheses. The isomorphic structures are composed of honeycomb sheets. Heat transfer reveals the eigenstates that determine the temperatures of the phase transitions. Quantum entanglement and degeneracy explain the heat capacities and latent heats. The supercooled liquid is a superposition of the high and low density eigenstates. Bose-Einstein condensation also explains the honeycomb pattern of an aerosol of droplets.</description>

      <title>More quantum chemistry with fewer qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, and molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favorable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>
