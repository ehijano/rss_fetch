      <title>Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling of Day-Ahead Wind Power Generation with Input-Warped Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a Gaussian Process (GP) spatiotemporal model to capture features of day-ahead wind power forecasts. We work with hourly-scale day-ahead forecasts across hundreds of wind farm locations, with the main aim of constructing a fully probabilistic joint model across space and hours of the day. To this end, we design a separable space-time kernel, implementing both temporal and spatial input warping to capture the non-stationarity in the covariance of wind power. We conduct synthetic experiments to validate our choice of the spatial kernel and to demonstrate the effectiveness of warping in addressing nonstationarity. The second half of the paper is devoted to a detailed case study using a realistic, fully calibrated dataset representing wind farms in the ERCOT region of Texas.</description>

      <title>Identification of extreme weather events and impacts of the disasters in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important consequence of human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather events. The impact of extreme weather events is quantified in some parts of the globe, but it remains underestimated in several countries. In this work we first quantify the extreme temperature and precipitation events in Brazil using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes 634 meteorological stations that have worked intermittently since 1961. We show that the anomaly in temperature has increased by more than 1{\deg}C in the last 60 years and that extreme events are heterogeneously distributed in the country. In terms of precipitation, our analyses show that it is getting drier in the Northwest region of Brazil while excessive precipitation events are increasing in the South, in agreement with previous works. We then use data from S2iD, an official database that registers disasters in Brazil to estimate their impact in terms of human damage and financial costs in the last ten years. The analysis shows that the drought extreme events are the most expensive, several of them reaching a cost of over a billion USD. Although we are not able to attribute the natural disasters registered in one database to the extreme weather events identified using the meteorological data, we discuss the possible correlations between them. Finally, we present a proposal of using extreme value theory to estimate the probability of having severe extreme events of precipitation in locations where there are already some natural disasters.</description>

      <title>A Generative Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Ensembles of Precipitation Maps Conditioned on Multisensor Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generative diffusion model is used to produce probabilistic ensembles of precipitation intensity maps at the 1-hour 5-km resolution. The generation is conditioned on infrared and microwave radiometric measurements from the GOES and DMSP satellites and is trained with merged ground radar and gauge data over southeastern United States. The generated precipitation maps reproduce the spatial autocovariance and other multiscale statistical properties of the gauge-radar reference fields on average. Conditioning the generation on the satellite measurements allows us to constrain the magnitude and location of each generated precipitation feature. The mean of the 128- member ensemble shows high spatial coherence with the reference fields with 0.82 linear correlation between the two. On average, the coherence between any two ensemble members is approximately the same as the coherence between any ensemble member and the ground reference, attesting that the ensemble dispersion is a proper measure of the estimation uncertainty. From the generated ensembles we can easily derive the probability of the precipitation intensity exceeding any given intensity threshold, at the 5-km resolution of the generation or at any desired aggregated resolution.</description>
