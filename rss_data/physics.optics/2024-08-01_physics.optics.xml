      <title>Femtosecond switching of strong light-matter interactions in microcavities with two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical logic devices based on nonlinear light-matter interactions hold the promise to overcome the speed limitations of conventional electronic devices. Strong coupling of excitons and photons inside an optical resonator enhances such interactions and generates new polariton states which give access to unique nonlinear phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, used for all-optical ultrafast polariton transistors. However, the pulse energies required to pump such devices range from tens to hundreds of pJ, making them not competitive with electronic transistors. Here we introduce a new paradigm for all-optical switching based on the ultrafast transition from the strong to the weak coupling regime in microcavities embedding atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Employing single and double stacks of hBN-encapsulated MoS$_2$ homobilayers with high optical nonlinearities and fast exciton relaxation times, we observe a collapse of the 55-meV polariton gap and its revival in less than one picosecond, lowering the threshold for optical switching below 4 pJ per pulse, while retaining ultrahigh switching frequencies. As an additional degree of freedom, the switching can be triggered pumping either the intra- or the interlayer excitons of the bilayers at different wavelengths, speeding up the polariton dynamics, owing to unique interspecies excitonic interactions. Our approach will enable the development of compact ultrafast all-optical logical circuits and neural networks, showcasing a new platform for polaritonic information processing based on manipulating the light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Silicon Double-Disk Optomechanical Resonators from Wafer-Scale Double-Layered Silicon-on-Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) optomechanical resonators are a promising technology for the simultaneous control and measurement of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. They offer potential for use across a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers. Double-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and optical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly attractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated fabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been demonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of double-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate functional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical coupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical quality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical coupling of approximately 15 kHz.</description>

      <title>Construction of various time-dependent Hamiltonians on a single photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics provides an important platform for simulating physical models with high-performance chip-scale devices, where the lattice size and the time-dependence of a model are key ingredients for further enriching the functionality of a photonic chip. Here, we propose and demonstrate the construction of various time-dependent Hamiltonian models using a single microresonator on thin-film lithium niobate chip. Such an integrated microresonator holds high quality factor to 10^6, and supports the construction of the synthetic frequency lattice with effective lattice sites up to 152 under the electro-optic modulation. By further applying a bichromatic modulation composed of two radio-frequency signals oppositely detuned from the resonant frequency in the microresonator, we build different time-dependent Hamiltonians with the time-varying nearest-neighbor coupling strength in synthetic frequency lattice. We measure the temporal features from capturing the dynamic band structures of the lattice and demonstrate a variety of time-dependent synthetic lattice models by engineering the driven pattern of the modulation, highlighting great flexibility of the microresonator. Our work shows a photonic chip for simulating versatile time-dependent Hamiltonians, which pushes forward quantum simulations in integrated photonics with great experimental tunability and reconfigurability.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Microwave resonator-enabled broadband on-chip electro-optic frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs play a crucial role in optical communications, time-frequency metrology, precise ranging, and sensing. Among various generation schemes, resonant electro-optic combs are particularly attractive for its excellent stability, flexibility and broad bandwidths. In this approach, an optical pump undergoes multiple electro-optic modulation processes in a high-Q optical resonator, resulting in cascaded spectral sidebands. However, most resonant electro-optic combs to date make use of lumped-capacitor electrodes with relatively inefficient utilization of the input electrical power. This design also reflects most electrical power back to the driving circuits and necessitates costly RF isolators in between, presenting substantial challenges in practical applications. To address these issues, we present an RF circuit friendly electro-optic frequency comb generator incorporated with on-chip coplanar microwave resonator electrodes, based on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Our design achieves more than three times electrical power reduction with minimal reflection at the designed comb repetition rate of ~ 25 GHz. We experimentally demonstrate broadband electro-optic frequency comb generation with a comb span of &gt;85 nm at a moderate electrical driving power of 740 mW (28.7 dBm). Our power-efficient and isolator-free electro-optic comb source could offer compact, low-cost and simple-to-design solution for applications in spectroscopy, high-precise metrology, optical communications.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering of Polaritonic Amplification in Dispersive Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of dispersive photonic time crystals (PTCs) and their potential applications for controlling light-matter interaction. By employing the Lorentz-Drude model, we analyze theoretically and via numerical simulation the effects of periodic modulation of dispersion parameters, revealing the emergence of hybrid bandgaps from interaction of polaritonic branches with unique characteristics. Our study demonstrates that dispersive PTCs offer novel excitation channels and amplification possibilities, that require lower modulation frequencies compared to non-dispersive systems thus alleviating experimental challenges for the realization of PTCs in the optical regime. These findings pave the way for advancements in polaritonic lasing and resonant Raman scattering.</description>

      <title>A Space-Time Knife-Edge In Epsilon-Near-Zero Films for Ultrafast Pulse Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have shown strong refractive nonlinearities that can be fast in an absolute sense. While continuing to advance fundamental science, such as time varying interactions, the community is still searching for an application that can effectively make use of the strong index modulation offered. Here we combine the effect of strong space-time index modulation in ENZ materials with the beam deflection technique to introduce a new approach to optical pulse characterization that we term a space-time knife edge. We show that in this approach, we are able to extract temporal and spatial information of a Gaussian beam with only two time resolved measurements. The approach achieves this without phase-matching requirements (&lt;1 micron thick film) and can achieve a high signal to noise ratio by combining the system with lock-in detection, facilitating the measurement of weak refractive index changes (delta_n ~ 10^-5) for low intensity beams. Thus, the space-time knife edge can offer a new avenue for ultrafast light measurement and demonstrates a use cases of ENZ materials. In support of this, we outline temporal dynamics for refractive index changes in non-colinear experiments opening avenues for better theoretical understanding of both the spatial and temporal dynamics of emerging ENZ films.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, offer significant advantages in sensor design. However, the extreme sensitivity near EPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degree of freedom to achieve controllable EPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization of the incident light and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale programmable photonic circuits are opening up new possibilities for information processing providing fast and energy-efficient means for matrix-vector multiplication. Here, we introduce a novel architecture of photonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices, usually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or quantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter meshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous designs, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology. We have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower depth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware errors.</description>

      <title>Limitations on bandwidth-integrated passive cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for the computation of structure-agnostic bounds on the performance of passive cloaks over a nonzero bandwidth. We apply this framework in 2D to the canonical scenario of cloaking a circular object. We find that perfect cloaking using a finite-sized isotropic cloak is impossible over any bandwidth, with the bounds scaling linearly with the bandwidth before saturating due to the finite size of the cloak and the presence of material loss. The bounds also exhibit linear scaling with material loss in the cloak and linear scaling with the inverse of the radial thickness of the design region before saturation due to finite-size effects or the presence of material loss. The formulation could readily find applications in the development of cloaking devices, setting expectations and benchmarks for optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electroluminescence device for on-demand single photon generation at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research focused on single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by layered semiconductors, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has revealed a promising alternative to quantum dots (QDs) for generating single, indistinguishable photons. hBN-based SPEs offer lower material costs, room temperature emission, and easy integration into potential optoelectronic devices due to the layered structure of the host crystal. This work presents compact hybrid electroluminescence devices, in which GaN laser diodes (LDs) are used for bottom-to-top excitation of hBN nanoflakes deposited on the laser facets. Our approach circumvents the issue of electroluminescence generation from hBN and provides access to the SPE's signal without optical driving by an external laser. Using laser diodes upgraded with Bragg reflectors a room-temperature generation of single photons from hBN is confirmed by an 80%-dip in their g(2) second-order correlation. The on-demand emission of single photons at room temperature is demonstrated by driving the laser diodes in pulsed operation, with confidence supported by a measured g(2)(0) value of 0.37.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Terahertz Coupling in a van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of strongly coupled photon-matter systems aims to create novel hybrid phases that enhance or modify material properties. A key challenge has been developing versatile platforms for exploring cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) of quantum materials. Here, we demonstrate and probe ultrastrong light-matter coupling in atomically-thin van der Waals materials. We developed a broadband time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated, two-dimensional quantum materials with sub-wavelength photon confinement at terahertz frequencies. Using bilayer graphene as a model system, we perform spectroscopic studies across a wide range of frequencies and gate voltages. For the first time, we measure the field-tunable band gap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while simultaneously observing clear signatures of ultrastrong coupling, with interaction strengths exceeding $\Omega/\omega\approx 40\%$. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental implementation of cavity QED in van der Waals materials, paving the way for further studies of exotic phases and novel light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-sized Objects at Micrometer Resolution: Extending Field-of-View in Wavefront Marker X-ray Phase-Contrast Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in propagation-based phase-contrast imaging, such as hierarchical imaging, have enabled the visualization of internal structures in large biological specimens and material samples. However, wavefront marker-based techniques, which provide quantitative electron density information, face challenges when imaging larger objects due to stringent beam stability requirements and potential structural changes in objects during longer measurements. Extending the fields-of-view of these methods is crucial for obtaining comparable quantitative results across beamlines and adapting to the smaller beam profiles of fourth-generation synchrotron sources. We introduce a novel technique combining an adapted eigenflat optimization with deformable image registration to address the challenges and enable quantitative high-resolution scans of centimeter-sized objects with micrometre resolution. We demonstrate the potential of the method by obtaining an electron density map of a rat brain sample 15 mm in diameter using speckle-based imaging, despite the limited horizontal field-of-view of 6 mm of the beamline (PETRA III, P05, operated by Hereon at DESY). This showcases the ability of the technique to significantly widen the range of application of wavefront marker-based techniques in both biological and materials science research.</description>

      <title>Advanced pure tilt actuator for testing tilt-to-length coupling in space-based gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling, caused by the jitter of test masses or satellites, is a significant noise source in space-based gravitational wave detection. Calibrating and suppressing TTL coupling noise at the sub-nanometer level is essential. One main challenge in current ground-based TTL coupling testing is the residual translational movement of the tilt actuator. This paper introduces the development of an advanced pure tilt actuator (APTA) specifically designed for testing TTL coupling. The APTA provides precise tilt motion and is monitored by a four-beam interferometer, which measures the displacement of attached array pyramids. We present a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that this optical test bed, equipped with the APTA, can achieve subnanometer-level TTL coupling calibration. In addition, a typical heterodyne interferometer was tested using the APTA test bed. Comparative testing demonstrated that the imaging system is capable of effectively suppressing TTL coupling errors. The TTL coupling coefficients were reduced from over plus-minus 30 micrometers per radian to within plus-minus 5 micrometers per radian across a range of plus-minus 200 microradians, meeting the preliminary requirements for the TianQin mission. This APTA test platform has the potential to be widely utilized for ground-based TTL coupling inspection.</description>

      <title>Using low-cost Blu-Ray Optical Pickup Units for Measurement of Single Photon Emission from NV-Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a cost-effective method for collecting single photons emitted from single nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Conventional components of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, such as microscope objectives and the piezo translation stages, are replaced by two affordable Blu-ray optical pickup units. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup is used to identify single photon emission. The proposed approach is inexpensive and simple and lowers the entry-level to single photon research for quantum technologies. This enables student lab experiments or demonstration experiments at schools and shows that efficient sources of quantum light can be made from standard components compatible with established industry processes.</description>

Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators represent a promising technology for future compact accelerating systems, enabling the acceleration of tens of pC to above $1\,$GeV over just a few centimeters. Nonetheless, these devices currently lack the stability, beam quality and average current of conventional systems. While many efforts have focused on improving acceleration stability and quality, little progress has been made in increasing the beam's average current, which is essential for future laser-plasma-based applications. In this paper, we investigate a laser-plasma acceleration regime aimed at increasing the beam average current with energies up to few-MeVs, efficiently enhancing the beam charge. We present experimental results on configurations that allow reaching charges of $5-30\,$nC and a maximum conversion efficiency of around $14\,$%. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell simulations, we interpret the experimental results and present a detailed study on electron dynamics. From our analysis, we show that most electrons are not trapped in a plasma wave; rather, they experience ponderomotive acceleration. Thus, we prove the laser pulse as the main driver of the particles' energy gain process.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrationally-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Flexible Molecules: Linear Alkanes C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$ ($n$=1-8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrated full core-hole density functional theory with Franck-Condon calculations, considering Duschinsky rotation, to simulate vibrationally-resolved C1s X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of eight linear alkanes, from methane to octane (C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$, $n$=1--8). Results align excellently with experimental absolute binding energies and profiles. The spectrum of ethane serves as a ``spectral seed'', with each longer alkane's atom-specific spectrum displaying similar characteristics, albeit with shifts and slight intensity adjustments. Detailed assignments clarify the distinct spectra in short alkanes ($n$=1--4) and their stabilization in long alkanes ($n$=5--8). Carbons are classified as central or distal (C$_1$ and C$_2$), with central carbons contributing nearly identically to the lowest-energy feature A, while distal carbons contribute to the second lowest-energy feature B (both are 0-0 transitions). Increasing molecule size adds more central carbons, enhancing feature A and weakening feature B. Our analysis identifies two dominant Franck-Condon-active vibrations: C$^*$--H stretching ($\sim$3400-3500 cm$^{-1}$) and bending ($\sim$1400-1500 cm$^{-1}$) modes. Structural analysis shows that core ionization minimally affects alkane geometry, less than in ring compounds from previous studies. This work extends our protocol from rigid ring compounds to flexible molecules, contributing to building a high-resolution theoretical XPS library and enhancing the understanding of vibronic coupling.</description>

Abstract: Topological bound states in the continuum are confined wave-mechanical objects that offer advantageous ways to enhance light-matter interactions in compact photonic devices. In particular, their large quality factor in the strong-coupling regime has recently enabled the demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation of bound-state-in-the-continuum polaritons. Here, we show that condensation into a negative-mass bound state in the continuum exhibits interaction-induced state confinement, opening opportunities for optically reprogrammable molecular arrays of quantum fluids of light. We exploit this optical trapping mechanism to demonstrate that such molecular complexes show hybridization with macroscopic modes with unusual topological charge multiplicity. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our technique by constructing extended mono- and diatomic chains of bound-state-in-the-continuum polariton fluids that display non-Hermitian band formation and the opening of a minigap. Our findings offer insights into large-scale, reprogrammable, driven, dissipative many-body systems in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Pyramid diffractive optical networks for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) are composed of successive transmissive layers optimized using supervised deep learning to all-optically implement various computational tasks between an input and output field-of-view (FOV). Here, we present a pyramid-structured diffractive optical network design (which we term P-D2NN), optimized specifically for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification. In this design, the diffractive layers are pyramidally scaled in alignment with the direction of the image magnification or demagnification. This P-D2NN design creates high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction, while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - achieving the desired unidirectional imaging operation using a much smaller number of diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume. Furthermore, P-D2NN design maintains its unidirectional image magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination wavelengths despite being trained with a single wavelength. We also designed a wavelength-multiplexed P-D2NN, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct illumination wavelengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by cascading multiple unidirectional P-D2NN modules, we can achieve higher magnification factors. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also validated experimentally using terahertz illumination, successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors.</description>

Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

Abstract: In the Letter, Xu et al. reported that edge modes disappear in the expanded structure of Wu-Hu model characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index, while appear in the trivial shrunken structure, when the edge cuts through the hexagonal unit cell. They then concluded that these edge modes are defect modes lacking topological protection. Unfortunately, their approach is not justified, rendering the conclusion unsolid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The insensitivity of photons towards external magnetic fields forms one of the hardest barriers against efficient magneto-optical control, aiming at modulating the polarization state of light. However, there is even scarcer evidence of magneto-optical effects that can spatially modulate light. Here, we demonstrate the latter by exploiting strongly coupled states of semimagnetic matter and light in planar semiconductor microcavities. We nonresonantly excite two spatially adjacent exciton-polariton condensates which, through inherent ballistic near field coupling mechanism, spontaneously synchronise into a dissipative quantum fluidic supermode of definite parity. Applying a magnetic field along the optical axis, we continuously adjust the light-matter composition of the condensate exciton-polaritons, inducing a supermode switch into a higher order mode of opposite parity. Our findings set the ground towards magnetic spatial modulation of nonlinear light.</description>

      <title>Dirac exciton-polariton condensates in photonic crystal gratings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum have recently been utilized in photonic crystal gratings to achieve strong coupling and ultralow power-driven condensation of bosonic exciton-polariton quasiparticles with atypical Dirac-like features in their dispersion relation. Here, we develop the single- and many-body theory of these new effective relativistic exciton-polaritons modes and describe their mean field condensation dynamics facilitated by the interplay between protection from the radiative continuum and negative-mass pump induced optical trapping. Our theory accounts for many tunable grating parameters giving full control over the diffractive coupling properties between guided polaritons and the radiative continuum previously unexplored in the context of driven condensation. In particular, we discover stable cyclical condensate solutions mimicking a driven-dissipative analog of the zitterbewegung effect characterized by coherent superposition of both ballistic (rapid phase front) and trapped (slow phase front) polariton waves. Finally, important distinctions are drawn between the concepts of near field and far field in the photonic grating, clarifying recent experimental observations on the emission characteristics of these long lived nonlinear Dirac polaritons.</description>

      <title>Stable-to-unstable transition in quantum friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spectroscopy of semiconductor moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use time-resolved nonlinear pump--probe measurements to reveal features of semiconductor moir\'e materials not accessible to linear spectroscopy. With an intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons or exciton--polarons in various moir\'e minibands. A broadband probe pulse in turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between different optical excitations and to observe signatures of a bound biexciton state between two different moir\'e exciton modes. In contrast to electron doped monolayers, spatially confined moir\'e attractive polarons behave as an ensemble of non-interacting two-level emitters, exhibiting an electron-density-independent ac-Stark effect. Tuning the pump laser into resonance with the attractive polaron, we demonstrate the filling of the moir\'e lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moir\'e flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>
