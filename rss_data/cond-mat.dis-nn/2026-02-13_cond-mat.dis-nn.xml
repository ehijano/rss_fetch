      <title>Unlearnable phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.</description>

      <title>Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of a random nanowire network: comparison of two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to real systems, which, within the mean-field approach, leads to overestimated estimates of electrical conductivity, especially when the contact resistances between conductors make the main contribution to the electrical conductivity of the system. In the case of a two-dimensional model, the electrical conductivity of the system depends quadratically on the number density of conductors, whereas in the case of a three-dimensional model this dependence is linear.</description>
