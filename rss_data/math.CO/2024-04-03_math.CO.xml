      <title>Reptile trapezoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric figure is a reptile if it can be dissected into at least two similar copies congruent to each other. We prove that if a trapezoid is a reptile and not a parallelogram, then the length of each base is a linear combination of the lengths of its legs with rational coefficients. We then rule out isosceles trapezoids and right trapezoids which are not reptile. In particular, we prove that, up to similarity, there are at most six reptile right trapezoids, not a parallelogram, whose acute internal angle is a rational multiple of $\pi$. Finally, we present a rep-25 right trapezoid that is not a parallelogram and is not similar to any of the known reptile trapezoids.</description>

      <title>On the Sombor index of trees with degree restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Sombor index of trees with various degree restrictions. In addition to rediscovering that among all trees with a given degree sequence, the greedy tree minimises the Sombor index and the alternating greedy tree maximises it, we also provide a full characterisation of all trees that have those maximum or minimum values. Moreover, we compare trees with different degree sequences and deduce a few corollaries.</description>

      <title>Tutte polynomials in superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate a quotient of superspace to any hyperplane arrangement by considering the differential closure of an ideal generated by powers of certain homogeneous linear forms. This quotient is a superspace analogue of the external zonotopal algebra, and it further contains the central zonotopal algebra in the appropriate grading. We show that an evaluation of the bivariate Tutte polynomial is the bigraded Hilbert series of this quotient. We then use this fact to construct an explicit basis for the Macaulay inverse. These results generalize those of Ardila-Postnikov and Holtz-Ron. We also discuss enumerative consequences of our results in the setting of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>The Linear $q$-Hypergraph Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a random greedy process to construct $q$-uniform linear hypergraphs using the differential equation method. We show for $q=o(\sqrt{\log n})$, that this process yields a hypergraph with $\frac{n(n-1)}{q(q-1)}(1-o(1))$ edges. We also give some bounds for maximal linear hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Mahonian-Stirling statistics for partial permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Cheng et al. (Adv. in Appl. Math. 143 (2023) 102451) generalized the inversion number to partial permutations, which are also known as Laguerre digraphs, and asked for a suitable analogue of MacMahon's major index. We provide such a major index, namely, the corresponding maj and inv statistics are equidistributed, and exhibit a Haglund-Remmel-Wilson type identity. We then interpret some Jacobi-Rogers polynomials in terms of Laguerre digraphs generalizing Deb and Sokal's alternating Laguerre digraph interpretation of some special Jacobi-Rogers polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal Gr\"unbaum partition problem in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gr\"unbaum's equipartition problem asked if for any measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ there are always $d$ hyperplanes which divide $\mathbb{R}^d$ into $2^d$ $\mu$-equal parts. This problem is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 3$ and a negative one for $d\ge 5$. A variant of this question is to require the hyperplanes to be mutually orthogonal. This variant is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 2$ and there is reason to expect it to have a negative answer for $d\ge 3$. In this note we exhibit measures that prove this. Additionally, we describe an algorithm that checks if a set of $8n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be split evenly by $3$ mutually orthogonal planes. To our surprise, it seems the probability that a random set of $8$ points chosen uniformly and independently in the unit cube does not admit such a partition is less than $0.001$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concept of universal sets from the additive--combinatorial point of view. Among other results we obtain some applications of this type of uniformity to sets avoiding solutions to linear equations, and get an optimal upper bound for the covering number of general sumsets.</description>

      <title>Burning Random Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a Galton-Watson tree with a given offspring distribution $\xi$, where $\xi$ is a $Z_{\geq 0}$-valued random variable with $E[\xi] = 1$ and $0 &lt; \sigma^{2}:=Var[\xi] &lt; \infty$. For $n \geq 1$, let $T_{n}$ be the tree $\mathcal{T}$ conditioned to have $n$ vertices. In this paper we investigate $b(T_n)$, the burning number of $T_n$. Our main result shows that asymptotically almost surely $b(T_n)$ is of the order of $n^{1/3}$.</description>

      <title>Coalescing sets preserving cospectrality of graphs arising from block similarity matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalescing involves gluing one or more rooted graphs onto another graph. Under specific conditions, it is possible to start with cospectral graphs that are coalesced in similar ways that will result in new cospectral graphs. We present a sufficient condition for this based on the block structure of similarity matrices, possibly with additional constraints depending on which type of matrix is being considered. The matrices considered in this paper include the adjacency, Laplacian, signless Laplacian, distance, and generalized distance matrix.</description>

      <title>On the permutations that strongly avoid the pattern 312 or 231</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, B\'ona and Smith introduced the notion of \emph{strong pattern avoidance}, that is, a permutation and its square both avoid a given pattern. In this paper, we enumerate the set of permutations $\pi$ which not only strongly avoid the pattern $312$ or $231$ but also avoid the pattern $\tau$, for $\tau\in S_3$ and some $\tau\in S_4$. One of them is to give a positive answer to a conjecture of Archer and Geary.</description>

      <title>On tight $(k,\ell)$-stable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k&gt;\ell\ge0$, a graph $G$ is $(k,\ell)$-stable if $\alpha(G-S)\geq \alpha(G)-\ell$ for every $S\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|=k$. A recent result of Dong and Wu [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 36 (2022) 229--240] shows that every $(k,\ell)$-stable graph $G$ satisfies $\alpha(G) \le \lfloor ({|V(G)|-k+1})/{2}\rfloor+\ell$. A $(k,\ell)$-stable graph $G$ is tight if $\alpha(G) = \lfloor ({|V(G)|-k+1})/{2}\rfloor+\ell$; and $q$-tight for some integer $q\ge0$ if $\alpha(G) = \lfloor ({|V(G)|-k+1})/{2}\rfloor+\ell-q$. In this paper, we first prove that for all $k\geq 24$, the only tight $(k, 0)$-stable graphs are $K_{k+1}$ and $K_{k+2}$, answering a question of Dong and Luo [arXiv: 2401.16639]. We then prove that for all nonnegative integers $k, \ell, q$ with $k\geq 3\ell+3$, every $q$-tight $(k,\ell)$-stable graph has at most $k-3\ell-3+2^{3(\ell+2q+4)^2}$ vertices, answering a question of Dong and Luo in the negative.</description>

      <title>Synchronicity of descent and excedance enumerators in the alternating subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalising the work of Dey, we define the notion of ultra-synchronicity of sequences of real numbers. Let $B_{n,k},C_{n,k},P_{n,k},Q_{n,k}$ be the number of even permutations with $k$ descents, odd permutations with $k$ descents, even permutations with $k$ excedances and odd permutations with $k$ excedances respectively. We show that the four sequences are ultra-synchronised for all $n\ge 5$. This proves a strengthening of two conjectures of Dey.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs of girth 5 and 6 and coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum number of edges in an $N$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph with girth $g$ where $g \in \{5,6 \}$. Writing $\textrm{ex}_r ( N, \mathcal{C}_{&lt;g} )$ for this maximum, it is shown that $\textrm{ex}_r ( N , \mathcal{C}_{ &lt; 5} ) = \Omega_r ( N^{3/2 - o(1)} )$ for $r \in \{4,5,6 \}$. We address an unproved claim from [31] asserting a technique of Ruzsa can be used to show that this lower bound holds for all $r \geq 3$. We carefully explain one of the main obstacles that was overlooked at the time the claim from [31] was made, and show that this obstacle can be overcome when $r\in \{4,5,6\}$. We use constructions from coding theory to prove nontrivial lower bounds that hold for all $r \geq 3$. Finally, we use a recent result of Conlon, Fox, Sudakov, and Zhao to show that the sphere packing bound from coding theory may be improved when upper bounding the size of linear $q$-ary codes of distance $6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce combinatorial objects named matricubes that provide a generalization of the theory of matroids. As matroids provide a combinatorial axiomatization of hyperplane arrangements, matricubes provide a combinatorial axiomatization of arrangements of initial flags in a vector space. We give cryptomorphic axiomatic systems in terms of rank function, flats, circuits, and independent sets, and formulate a duality concept. We also provide precise links between matricubes, permutation arrays and matroids, and raise several open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov-Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>

      <title>On off-diagonal hypergraph Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in Ramsey theory is to determine the growth rate in terms of $n$ of the Ramsey number $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ of a fixed $3$-uniform hypergraph $H$ versus the complete $3$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices. We study this problem, proving two main results. First, we show that for a broad class of $H$, including links of odd cycles and tight cycles of length not divisible by three, $r(H, K_n^{(3)}) \ge 2^{\Omega_H(n \log n)}$. This significantly generalizes and simplifies an earlier construction of Fox and He which handled the case of links of odd cycles and is sharp both in this case and for all but finitely many tight cycles of length not divisible by three. Second, disproving a folklore conjecture in the area, we show that there exists a linear hypergraph $H$ for which $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ is superpolynomial in $n$. This provides the first example of a separation between $r(H,K_n^{(3)})$ and $r(H,K_{n,n,n}^{(3)})$, since the latter is known to be polynomial in $n$ when $H$ is linear.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is Part 3 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of vertices, and a partition of pairs of vertices. We define two corresponding growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the pairs component. In this paper, we give an almost complete description of the possible growth rates for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponential, or wowzer. The only existing lower bound constructions for this type of hypergraph regularity were due to Moshkovitz and Shapira, who constructed examples requiring a wowzer-type lower bound on the vertex component in a weaker type of hypergraph regularity. The results of this paper rely crucially on the fact that a slightly simpler construction can be used to produce a wowzer type lower bound for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. The key ingredient in this simpler example is a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the fourth in a series of papers on the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we consider a form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two components, a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the pairs component. In this paper we consider the behavior of the function $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential.</description>

      <title>Token graphs of Cayley graphs as lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a general method for representing $k$-token graphs of Cayley graphs as lifts of voltage graphs. This allows us to construct line graphs of circulant graphs and Johnson graphs as lift graphs on cyclic groups. As an application of the method, we derive the spectra of the considered token graphs. This method can also be applied to dealing with other matrices, such as the Laplacian or the signless Laplacian, and to construct token digraphs of Cayley digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [7], Higashitani, Kummer, and Micha{\l}ek pose a conjecture about the symmetric edge polytopes of complete multipartite graphs and confirm it for a number of families in the bipartite case. We confirm that conjecture for a number of new classes following the authors' methods and we present a more general result which suggests that the methods in their current form might not be enough to prove the conjecture in full generality.</description>

Abstract: We study the Milnor fiber boundary for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$. This is one of the examples of non-isolated surface singularities, which are studied by N\'emethi--Szil\'ard. In this paper, we compute the first homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary for a generic arrangement and prove it is combinatorially determined. In particular, this gives the affirmative answer to the conjecture of Suciu.</description>

Abstract: Polynomials commute under composition are referred to as commuting polynomials. In this paper, we study division properties for commuting polynomials with rational (and integer) coefficients. As a consequence, we show an algebraic particularity of the commuting polynomials coming from weighted sums for cycle graphs with pendant edges (arXiv:2402.07209v1.).</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of R(4,5)=25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1995, McKay and Radziszowski proved that the Ramsey number R(4,5) is equal to 25. Their proof relies on a combination of high-level arguments and computational steps. The authors have performed the computational parts of the proof with different implementations in order to reduce the possibility of an error in their programs. In this work, we prove this theorem in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 limiting the uncertainty to the small HOL4 kernel. Instead of verifying their algorithms directly, we rely on a verified SAT solver to prove gluing lemmas. To reduce the number of such lemmas and thus make the computational part of the proof feasible, we implement a generalization algorithm and verify that its output covers all the possible cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.13372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is \emph{hamiltonian-connected} if every pair of vertices can be connected by a hamiltonian path, and it is \emph{hamiltonian} if it contains a hamiltonian cycle. We construct families of non-hamiltonian graphs for which the ratio of pairs of vertices connected by hamiltonian paths to all pairs of vertices approaches 1. We then consider minimal graphs that are hamiltonian-connected. It is known that any order-$n$ graph that is hamiltonian-connected must have $\geq 3n/2$ edges. We construct an infinite family of graphs realizing this minimum.</description>

      <title>Modularity and partially observed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that there is an unknown underlying graph $G$ on a large vertex set, and we can test only a proportion of the possible edges to check whether they are present in $G$. If $G$ has high modularity, is the observed graph $G'$ likely to have high modularity? We see that this is indeed the case under a mild condition, in a natural model where we test edges at random. We find that $q^*(G') \geq q^*(G)-\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, as long as the expected number edges in $G'$ is large enough. Similarly, $q^*(G') \leq q^*(G)+\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, under the stronger condition that the expected average degree in $G'$ is large enough. Further, under this stronger condition, finding a good partition for $G'$ helps us to find a good partition for $G$.
  We also consider the vertex sampling model for partially observing the underlying graph: we find that for dense underlying graphs we may estimate the modularity by sampling constantly many vertices and observing the corresponding induced subgraph, but this does not hold for underlying graphs with a subquadratic number of edges. Finally we deduce some related results, for example showing that under-sampling tends to lead to overestimation of modularity.</description>

      <title>Spread approximations for forbidden intersections problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to approximate families of sets, complementing the existing `$\Delta$-system method' and `junta approximations method'. The approach, which we refer to as `spread approximations method', is based on the notion of $r$-spread families and builds on the recent breakthrough result of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang for the Erd\H os--Rado `Sunflower Conjecture'. Our approach can work in a variety of sparse settings.
  To demonstrate the versatility and strength of the approach, we present several of its applications to forbidden intersection problems, including bounds on the size of regular intersecting families, the resolution of the Erd\H os--S\'os problem for sets in a new range and, most notably, the resolution of the $t$-intersection and Erd\H os--S\'os problems for permutations in a new range. Specifically, we show that any collection of permutations of an $n$-element set with no two permutations intersecting in at most (exactly) $t-1$ elements has size at most $(n-t)!$, provided $t\le n^{1-\epsilon}$ ($t \le n^{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon}$) for an arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n&gt;n_0(\epsilon)$. Previous results for these problems only dealt with the case of fixed $t$. The proof follows the structure vs. randomness philosophy, which proved to be very efficient in proving results throughout mathematics and computer science.</description>

      <title>List-3-Coloring ordered graphs with a forbidden induced subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The List-3-Coloring Problem is to decide, given a graph $G$ and a list $L(v)\subseteq \{1,2,3\}$ of colors assigned to each vertex $v$ of $G$, whether $G$ admits a proper coloring $\phi$ with $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, and the $3$-Coloring Problem is the List-$3$-Coloring Problem on instances with $L(v)=\{1,2,3\}$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$. The List-$3$-Coloring Problem is a classical NP-complete problem, and it is well-known that while restricted to $H$-free graphs (meaning graphs with no induced subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph $H$), it remains NP-complete unless $H$ is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of a path. However, the current state of art is far from proving this to be sufficient for a polynomial time algorithm; in fact, the complexity of the $3$-Coloring Problem on $P_8$-free graphs (where $P_8$ denotes the eight-vertex path) is unknown. Here we consider a variant of the List-$3$-Coloring Problem called the Ordered Graph List-$3$-Coloring Problem, where the input is an ordered graph, that is, a graph along with a linear order on its vertex set. For ordered graphs $G$ and $H$, we say $G$ is $H$-free if $H$ is not isomorphic to an induced subgraph of $G$ with the isomorphism preserving the linear order. We prove, assuming $H$ to be an ordered graph, a nearly complete dichotomy for the Ordered Graph List-$3$-Coloring Problem restricted to $H$-free ordered graphs. In particular, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if $H$ has at most one edge, and remains NP-complete if $H$ has at least three edges. Moreover, in the case where $H$ has exactly two edges, we give a complete dichotomy when the two edges of $H$ share an end, and prove several NP-completeness results when the two edges of $H$ do not share an end, narrowing the open cases down to three very special types of two-edge ordered graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study tilings of $\mathbb Z$, that is, coverings of $\mathbb Z$ by disjoint sets (tiles). Let $T=\{d_1,\ldots, d_s\}$ be a given multiset of distances. Is it always possible to tile $\mathbb Z$ by tiles, for which the multiset of distances between consecutive points is equal to $T$? In this paper, we give a sufficient condition that such a tiling exists. Our result allows multisets of distances to have arbitrarily many distinct values. Our result generalizes most of the previously known results, all of which dealt with the cases of $2$ or $3$ distinct distances.</description>

Abstract: We consider the general question of when all orbits under the unitary action of a finite group give a complex spherical design. Those orbits which have large stabilisers are then good candidates for being optimal complex spherical designs. This is done by developing the general theory of complex designs and associated (harmonic) Molien series for group actions. As an application, we give explicit constructions of some putatively optimal real and complex spherical t-designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14071v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi_n$ be a uniformly chosen random permutation on $[n]$. Using an analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive $k$-permutations are order isomorphic, the authors of a recent paper showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in $\pi_n$ is $\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))$ as $n\to\infty$. This exhibited the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. We use entirely different methods, namely the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, to reprove and slightly improve their result.</description>

Abstract: O and Shi proved that the Randi\'c index of any graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $\delta$ and maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is at least $\frac{\sqrt{\delta\Delta}}{\delta+\Delta}|G|$, with equality if and only if the graph is $(\delta,\Delta)$-biregular. In this note we give a short proof via a more general statement. We apply the latter to classify the graphs in any given degree range which minimise (or maximise) the generalised Randi\'c index for any exponent, and describe the transitions between different types of behaviour precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generalization of the notion of clique-width which aims to bridge the gap between classical hereditary width measures and the recently introduced graph product structure theory. Bounding the new H-clique-width, in the special case of H being the class of paths, is equivalent to admitting a hereditary (i.e., induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded clique-width. Furthermore, every graph admitting the usual (non-induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded tree-width, has bounded H-clique-width and, as a consequence, it admits the usual product structure in an induced way. We prove further basic properties of H-clique-width in general.</description>

      <title>Oligomorphic groups and tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an oligomorphic group $G$ and a measure $\mu$ for $G$ (in a sense that we introduce), we define a rigid tensor category $\underline{\mathrm{Perm}}(G; \mu)$ of "permutation modules," and, in certain cases, an abelian envelope $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(G; \mu)$ of this category. When $G$ is the infinite symmetric group, this recovers Deligne's interpolation category. Other choices for $G$ lead to fundamentally new tensor categories. For example, we construct the first known semi-simple pre-Tannakian categories in positive characteristic with super-exponential growth. One interesting aspect of our construction is that, unlike previous work in this direction, our categories are concrete: the objects are modules over a ring, and the tensor product receives a universal bi-linear map. Central to our constructions is a novel theory of integration on oligomorphic groups, which could be of more general interest. Classifying the measures on an oligomorphic group appears to be a difficult problem, which we solve in only a few cases.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of the Berezin-Karpelevich Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berezin-Karpelevich integral is a double integral over unitary matrices which plays the role of the Itzykson-Zuber integral in rectangular matrix models. We obtain a topological expansion of the Berezin-Karpelevich integral in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers, and obtain from this certain combinatorial identities.</description>

      <title>On (Random-order) Online Contention Resolution Schemes for the Matching Polytope of (Bipartite) Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS's) represent a modern tool for selecting a subset of elements, subject to resource constraints, when the elements are presented to the algorithm sequentially. OCRS's have led to some of the best-known competitive ratio guarantees for online resource allocation problems, with the added benefit of treating different online decisions -- accept/reject, probing, pricing -- in a unified manner. This paper analyzes OCRS's for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline. All in all, our results for OCRS directly improve the best-known competitive ratios for online accept/reject, probing, and pricing problems on graphs in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Comparing Hilbert depth of $I$ with Hilbert depth of $S/I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a monomial ideal of $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. We show that the following are equivalent: (i) $I$ is principal, (ii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)=n$, (iii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)=n-1$.
  Assuming that $I$ is squarefree, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\leq 3$ or $n\leq 5$ then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)+1$. Also, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\leq 5$ or $n\leq 7$ then then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)$.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>
