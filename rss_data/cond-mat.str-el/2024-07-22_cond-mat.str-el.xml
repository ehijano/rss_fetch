      <title>Metal-insulator transition of spinless fermions coupled to dispersive optical bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Including the previously ignored dispersion of phonons we revisit the metal-insulator transition problem in one-dimensional electron-phonon systems on the basis of a modified spinless fermion Holstein model. Using matrix-product-state techniques we determine the global ground-state phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit for the one-dimensional band case, and show that in particular the curvature of the bare phonon band has a significant effect, not only on the transport properties characterized by the conductance and the Luttinger liquid parameter, but also on the phase space structure of the model as a whole. While a downward curved (convex) dispersion of the phonons only shifts the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid to charge-density-wave quantum phase transition towards stronger EP coupling, an upward curved (concave) phonon band leads to a new phase-separated state which, in the case of strong dispersion, can even completely cover the charge-density wave. Such phase separation does not occur in the related Edwards fermion-boson model.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of the light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We clarify the decaying process of such a domain wall that is caused by fluctuations of the order parameters. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. The decay process comprises two non-trivial stages. During the first stage, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in the 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in the 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior. Our theory provides a fundamental physical picture for the dynamics of pump-induced domain walls in ultrafast experiments.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the magnetic-field-induced phase pocket in the non-Kramers doublet system PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide thermodynamic evidence for the presence of a magnetic-field-induced small phase pocket near the antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) phase boundary in the non-Kramers $\Gamma_3$ doublet system PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$. In particular, we measured the specific heat as functions of temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, and field angle $\phi_B$, and found a second specific-heat anomaly in a relatively wide field-angle range near $B \parallel [001]$, although fine tuning of the field strength is required. We also investigated the rotational magnetocaloric effect and evaluated an entropy change in this phase pocket. The present findings demonstrate that multipole degrees of freedom give rise to a magnetic-field-induced exotic order in PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, suggesting the possibility of switching between the order parameters or emergence of a multiple-$q$ order of quadrupoles.</description>

      <title>Search for orbital magnetism in the kagome superconductor ${\rm CsV_3Sb_5}$ using neutron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As many Kagome metals, the topological superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ with (A = K,Rb,Cs) hosts a charge density wave . A related chiral flux phase that breaks the time-reversal symmetry has been further theoretically predicted in these materials. The flux phase is associated with loop currents that produce ordered orbital magnetic moments, which would occur at the momentum points, $\bf M$, characterizing the charge-density wave state. Polarized neutron-diffraction experiments have been performed on an assembly of single crystals of ${\rm CsV_3Sb_5}$ to search for such orbital magnetic moments. No evidence for the existence of a three-dimensionally ordered moment is found at any temperature at the first ${\bf M_1}$=(1/2,0,0) point in the Brillouin zone within an excellent experimental uncertainty, ${\it i.e.}$ ${\bf m}=0 \pm 0.01\mu_B$ per vanadium atom. However, a hint to a magnetic orbital moment is found in the second Brillouin zone at {\bf M$_2$}=(1/2,1/2,0) at the detection limit of the experiment. Some loop currents patterns flowing ${\it only}$ on vanadium triangles are able to account for this finding suggesting an ordered orbital magnetic moment of, at most, $\sim 0.02 \pm 0.01\mu_B$ per vanadium triangle.</description>

      <title>Impurity flat band states in the diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems, i.e., models hosting dispersionless bands in their energy spectrum, have attracted great interest recently. The eigenstates of these FBs can be written as compact localized states (CLSs), meaning states having finite support only over a small, non-extensive portion of the lattice. When adjacent CLSs of a FB have spatial overlap, the subspace they span is, in general, non-orthogonal. Here, we consider precisely this scenario, in the form of a diamond chain with a finite magnetic flux per plaquette, which has a gapped midspectrum FB. After developing the general framework for projecting arbitrary operators onto a non-orthogonal subspace, we address the case of an open chain with small local impurities in the midchain plaquette. The framework is then applied to derive analytical expressions for the states of the FB affected by the impurities. The results are illustrated for three representative cases: two equal impurities, two symmetric impurities, and a single impurity. We also address the effects of diagonal disorder on the impurity states. Focusing on the equal impurities case, we show how these states effectively feel an averaged disorder determined by their spatial extension, which can be controlled by the flux. Due to this averaging effect, these states exhibit enhanced robustness to disorder. For the single-impurity case, we further reveal its exotic non-trivial topological phase, without precedent in the literature on Hermitian models, characterized by a half-integer winding number. By mapping the system onto an equivalent two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding lattice decorated with a central impurity line, the half-integer bulk invariants are shown to have a correspondence with the appearance of a single in-gap edge state when open boundary conditions (OBC) are imposed. Numerical simulations are performed to benchmark all analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Assessing the formation of spin and charge stripes in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ correlated density-functional theory methods (DFT + Hubbard $U$) to investigate the spin-density wave state of the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ which becomes superconducting under pressure. We predict that the ground state of this bilayer RP material is a single spin-charge stripe phase with in-plane up$^\prime$/up/down$^\prime$/down diagonal stripes with up$^\prime$/down$^\prime$ being low spin (formally Ni$^{3+}$: $d^7$) and up/down being high spin (formally Ni$^{2+}$: $d^8$). The main feature of this solution (that is insulating even at $U=0$) is the dominant role of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands around the Fermi level, which would become doped with the introduction of electrons via oxygen vacancies. In spite of the similarity with cuprates in terms of the dominant role of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands, some differences are apparent in the magnetic ground state of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: the antiferromagnetic out-of-plane coupling within the bilayer (linked to the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals forming a spin-singlet-like configuration) is found to be the dominant one while in-plane interactions are reduced due to the stripe order of the ground state. With pressure, this striped magnetic ground state remains similar in nature but the increase in bandwidth quickly transitions La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ into a metallic state with all the activity close to the Fermi level involving, to a large extent, $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. This is reminiscent of the cuprates and may provide key insights into how superconductivity arises in this material under pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Based Local Compilation of Variational Quantum Circuits for Large-Scale Quantum Many-Body Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of quantum many-body systems is a promising application of quantum computers. However, implementing the time-evolution operator as a quantum circuit efficiently on near-term devices with limited resources is challenging. Standard approaches like Trotterization often require deep circuits, making them impractical. This paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called Local Subspace Variational Quantum Compilation (LSVQC) for compiling the time-evolution operator. The LSVQC uses variational optimization to reproduce the action of the target time-evolution operator within a physically reasonable subspace. Optimization is performed on small local subsystems based on the Lieb-Robinson bound, allowing for cost function evaluation using small-scale quantum devices or classical computers. Numerical simulations on a spin-lattice model and an $\mathit{\text{ab initio}}$ effective model of strongly correlated material Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness. It is shown that the LSVQC achieves a 95% reduction in circuit depth compared to Trotterization while maintaining accuracy. The subspace restriction also reduces resource requirements and improves accuracy. Furthermore, we estimate the gate count needed to execute the quantum simulations using the LSVQC on near-term quantum computing architectures in the noisy intermediate-scale or early fault-tolerant quantum computing era. Our estimation suggests that the acceptable physical gate error rate for the LSVQC can be significantly larger than for Trotterization.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of an out-of-equilibrium anyonic sea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy dynamics of two-dimensional topological matter hinges on its one-dimensional edge modes. Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge modes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain braiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a framework for characterizing out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their effective potential and temperature, as well as the landscape of their excitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type of the tunneling quasiparticles; non-equilibrium anyonic states are underlain by power-law energy distributions. This allows "hot" anyons to tunnel above the chemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal witness function.</description>

      <title>Tunneling current and current correlations for anyonic quasiparticles of {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid in multi-edge geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider anyonic quasiparticles with charge e/2 described by the {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid, which collide in a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interferometer. These colliding anyonic channels can be formally viewed as hosting Laughlin-like fractional {\nu} = 1/2 quasiparticles. More specifically, two possible geometries are considered: (i) a two-edge-channel setup where anyons originate from equilibrium reservoirs; (ii) a four-edge-channel setup where nonequilibrium anyons arrive at the collider in the form of diluted beams. For both setups, we calculate the tunneling current and the current correlations. For setup (i), our results provide analytically exact expressions for the tunneling current, tunneling-current noise, and cross-correlation noise, The exact relation between conductance and noise is demonstrated. For setup (ii), we show that the tunneling current and the generalized Fano factor [defined in B. Rosenow et al. (2016)] are finite for diluted streams of {\nu} = 1/2 anyons. This is due to the processes where nonequilibrium anyons, supplied via either source edge, directly tunnel at the central QPC. Thus, to obtain meaningful results in this case, one should go beyond the so-called time-domain braiding processes, where nonequilibrium anyons do not tunnel at the collider, but rather indirectly influence the tunneling by braiding with the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs created at the collider. This suggests that the effect of direct tunneling and collisions of diluted anyons in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can be important for various observables in physical quantum-Hall edges at Laughlin filling fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard theoretical framework for fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAH) assumes an isolated flat Chern band in the single particle level. In this paper we challenges this paradigm for the FQAH recently observed in the pentalayer rhombohedral stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride (hBN). We show that the external moir\'e superlattice potential is simply a perturbation in a model with continuous translation symmetry. Through Hartree Fock calculation, we find that interaction opens a sizable remote band gap, resulting an isolated narrow $C=1$ Chern band at filling $\nu=1$. From exact diagonalization (ED) we identify FQAH phases at various fillings. But they exist also in the calculations without any external moir\'e potential. We suggest that the QAH insulator at $\nu=1$ should be viewed as an interaction driven topological Wigner crystal with QAH effect, which is then pinned by a small moir\'e potential. The $C=1$ QAH crystal is robust with a crystal period around $10\mathrm{nm}$ in 4-layer, 5-layer, 6-layer and 7-layer graphene systems. Our work suggests a new direction to exploring the interplay of topology and FQAH with spontaneous crystal formation in the vanishing moir\'e potential limit. We also propose a new system to generate and control both honeycomb and triangular moir\'e superlattice potential through Coulomb interaction from another control layer, which can stabilize or suppress the QAH crystal depending on the density of the control layer.</description>

      <title>Why Matthiessen's rule is violated in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perfect linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity in the strange metal phase of the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors is probably the most prominent manifestation of their non-Fermi liquid nature. A major puzzle about the strange metal behavior is that there is no discernible change in the trend of the dc resistivity at a temperature when we expect the electron-phonon coupling to play an essential role. The empirical Matthiessen's rule of summation of the resistivity from different scattering channels seems to be simply violated. On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling has long been proposed to be responsible for the various spectral anomalies observed in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane is proposed to be responsible for the peak-dip-hump spectral shape around the anti-nodal point. Here we show that the coupling to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction from the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the system as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon matrix element at momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. In the real space scenario, such a destructive interference effect simply amounts to the fact that the electron hopping between nearest-neighboring sites is suppressed by the antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the electrons. More generally, we argue that the electron-phonon coupling strength in the cuprate superconductors should diminish with the proximity of the Mott insulating phase as a result of similar vertex correction from the electron correlation effect. We think that this offers an interpretation for the violation of the Matthiessen's rule in the dc resistivity of the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetothermal conductivity in sibling Co-based honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets have attracted wide attention for exploration of exotic heat transport and their interplay with magnetic excitations. In this work, we have revealed a contrasting behavior in the magneto-thermal conductivity (MTC) between two Co-based honeycomb-lattice magnets Co4M2O9 (M = Nb, Ta), despite their identical lattice structures and quite similar magnetism. Co4Ta2O9 exhibits enhanced MTC of about 550% at 9 T of an in-plane magnetic field, comparable to other honeycomb-magnets, while MTC for Co4Nb2O9 reaches only ~30%. This marked difference is ascribed to distinct features in the field-induced evolution of magnetic excitations that resonantly scatter phonons. This finding sheds light on implicit impacts of non-magnetic ions on thermal transport, and hints at the potential for broad heat-transport tunability while preserving magnetism and lattice structures.</description>

Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06716</link>

Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>
