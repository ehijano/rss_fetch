      <title>Derivation of Mutual Information and Linear Minimum Mean-Square Error for Viterbi Decoding of Convolutional Codes Using the Innovations Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We see that convolutional coding/Viterbi decoding has the structure of the Kalman filter (or the linear minimum variance filter). First, we calculate the covariance matrix of the innovation (i.e., the soft-decision input to the main decoder in a Scarce-State-Transition (SST) Viterbi decoder). Then a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the one-step prediction error in the Kalman filter is obtained. Furthermore, from that matrix, a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the filtering error in the Kalman filter is derived using the formula in the Kalman filter. As a result, the average mutual information per branch for Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes is given using these covariance matrices. Also, the trace of the latter matrix represents the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE). We show that an approximate value of the average mutual information is sandwiched between half the SNR times the average filtering and one-step prediction LMMSEs. In the case of QLI codes, from the covariance matrix of the soft-decision input to the main decoder, we can get a matrix. We show that the trace of this matrix has some connection with the linear smoothing error.</description>

      <title>Large Generative Model Assisted 3D Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is a novel paradigm for data transmission in 6G. However, there are several challenges posed when performing SC in 3D scenarios: 1) 3D semantic extraction; 2) Latent semantic redundancy; and 3) Uncertain channel estimation. To address these issues, we propose a Generative AI Model assisted 3D SC (GAM-3DSC) system. Firstly, we introduce a 3D Semantic Extractor (3DSE), which employs generative AI models, including Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), to extract key semantics from a 3D scenario based on user requirements. The extracted 3D semantics are represented as multi-perspective images of the goal-oriented 3D object. Then, we present an Adaptive Semantic Compression Model (ASCM) for encoding these multi-perspective images, in which we use a semantic encoder with two output heads to perform semantic encoding and mask redundant semantics in the latent semantic space, respectively. Next, we design a conditional Generative adversarial network and Diffusion model aided-Channel Estimation (GDCE) to estimate and refine the Channel State Information (CSI) of physical channels. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed GAM-3DSC system in effectively transmitting the goal-oriented 3D scenario.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging technologies, such as holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) and stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), are driving the development of wireless communication systems. Specifically, the SIM is physically constructed by stacking multiple layers of metasurfaces and has an architecture similar to an artificial neural network (ANN), which can flexibly manipulate the electromagnetic waves that propagate through it at the speed of light. This architecture enables the SIM to achieve HMIMO precoding and combining in the wave domain, thus significantly reducing the hardware cost and energy consumption. In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem in SIM-assisted multi-user HMIMO communication systems. Since the number of antennas at the base station (BS) is much smaller than the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM, it is challenging to acquire the channel state information (CSI) in SIM-assisted multi-user systems. To address this issue, we collect multiple copies of the uplink pilot signals that propagate through the SIM. Furthermore, we leverage the array geometry to identify the subspace that spans arbitrary spatial correlation matrices. Based on partial CSI about the channel statistics, a pair of subspace-based channel estimators are proposed. Additionally, we compute the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimators and optimize the phase shifts of the SIM to minimize the MSE. Numerical results are illustrated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Enabled LEO Satellite Communications Relying on Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems have gained increasing attention as a crucial supplement to terrestrial wireless networks due to their extensive coverage area. This letter presents a novel system design for LEO satellite systems by leveraging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology. Specifically, the lightweight and energy-efficient SIM is mounted on a satellite to achieve multiuser beamforming directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, which substantially reduces the processing delay and computational load of the satellite compared to the traditional digital beamforming scheme. To overcome the challenges of obtaining instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and maximize the system's performance, a joint power allocation and SIM phase shift optimization problem for maximizing the ergodic sum rate is formulated based on statistical CSI, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is customized to solve it efficiently. Additionally, a user grouping method based on channel correlation and an antenna selection algorithm are proposed to further improve the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-based LEO satellite system design and statistical CSI-based AO algorithm.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Weight Enumerators of Reed-Muller Codes via Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an algorithmic approach for obtaining estimates of the weight enumerators of Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Our algorithm is based on a technique for estimating the partition functions of spin systems, which in turn employs a sampler that produces codewords according to a suitably defined Gibbs distribution. We apply our method to moderate-blocklength RM codes and derive approximate values of their weight enumerators. We observe that the rates of the weight enumerator estimates returned by our method are close to the true rates when these rates are either known or computable by brute-force search; in other cases, our computations provide provably robust estimates. As a byproduct, our sampling algorithm also allows us to obtain estimates of the weight spectra of RM codes. We illustrate our methods by providing estimates of the hitherto unknown weight enumerators of the RM$(11,5)$ code and the exact weight spectra of the RM$(10,3)$ and RM$(10,4)$ codes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Hybrid Beamforming for Holographic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep reinforcement learning. The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning-driven RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation Considerate Precoder Design for Multi-user Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems: The Concept and Fast Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) communication networks target peak data rates exceeding 1Tbps, necessitating base stations (BS) to support up to 100 simultaneous data streams. However, sparse pilot allocation to accommodate such streams poses challenges for users' channel estimation. This paper presents Channel Estimation Considerate Precoding (CECP), where BS precoders prioritize facilitating channel estimation alongside maximizing transmission rate. To address the computational complexity of 6G large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, we propose a computationally-efficient space-time block diagonal channel shortening (ST-BDCS) precoding scheme. By leveraging the sparse Toeplitz property of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, this time-domain precoding design effectively mitigates multi-user interference in the downlink and shortens the effective channel's temporal length. Consequently, users can estimate the channels using sparse pilots. To enable fast implementation, we develop a generalized complex-valued Toeplitz matrix QR decomposition algorithm applicable to various space-time signal processing problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the ST-BDCS precoding method approximates the rate performance of conventional subcarrier-by-subcarrier precoding schemes. However, it offers the advantages of easier channel estimation for users and significantly reduced computational complexity for the BS.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis for Distributed RISs-Assisted mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) has attracted considerable attention due to its wide bandwidth and high frequency. However, it is highly susceptible to blockages, resulting in significant degradation of the coverage and the sum rate. A promising approach is deploying distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can establish extra communication links. In this paper, we investigate the impact of distributed RISs on the coverage probability and the sum rate in mmWave wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first introduce the system model, which includes the blockage, the RIS and the user distribution models, leveraging the Poisson point process. Then, we define the association criterion and derive the conditional coverage probabilities for the two cases of direct association and reflective association through RISs. Finally, we combine the two cases using Campbell's theorem and the total probability theorem to obtain the closed-form expressions for the ergodic coverage probability and the sum rate. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach, demonstrating that the deployment of distributed RISs significantly improves the ergodic coverage probability by 45.4% and the sum rate by over 1.5 times.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the millimeter-wave (mmWave) near-field beam training problem to find the correct beam direction. In order to address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first design a set of sparse bases based on the polar domain sparsity of the near-field channel. Then, the random hash functions are chosen to construct the near-field multi-arm beam training codebook. Each multi-arm beam codeword is scanned in a time slot until all the predefined codewords are traversed. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to distinguish the signal from different base stations and obtain correctly aligned beams. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can reduce the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level, and achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of exhaustive beam training. Moreover, we also verify applicability under the far-field scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantized Constant-Envelope Waveform Design for Massive MIMO DFRC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have been recognized as enabling technologies for 6G wireless networks. This paper considers the advanced waveform design for hardware-efficient massive MIMO DFRC systems. Specifically, the transmit waveform is imposed with the quantized constant-envelope (QCE) constraint, which facilitates the employment of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and power-efficient amplifiers. The waveform design problem is formulated as the minimization of the mean square error (MSE) between the designed and desired beampatterns subject to the constructive interference (CI)-based communication quality of service (QoS) constraints and the QCE constraint. To solve the formulated problem, we first utilize the penalty technique to transform the discrete problem into an equivalent continuous penalty model. Then, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm for solving the penalty model. In particular, the ALM subproblem at each iteration is solved by a custom-built block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm, which admits closed-form updates, making the proposed inexact ALM algorithm computationally efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art ones. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to examine the impact of various system parameters on the trade-off between communication and radar performances.</description>

      <title>Limit of the Maximum Random Permutation Set Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Permutation Set (RPS) is a new type of set proposed recently, which can be regarded as the generalization of evidence theory. To measure the uncertainty of RPS, the entropy of RPS and its corresponding maximum entropy have been proposed. Exploring the maximum entropy provides a possible way of understanding the physical meaning of RPS. In this paper, a new concept, the envelope of entropy function, is defined. In addition, the limit of the envelope of RPS entropy is derived and proved. Compared with the existing method, the computational complexity of the proposed method to calculate the envelope of RPS entropy decreases greatly. The result shows that when $N \to \infty$, the limit form of the envelope of the entropy of RPS converges to $e \times (N!)^2$, which is highly connected to the constant $e$ and factorial. Finally, numerical examples validate the efficiency and conciseness of the proposed envelope, which provides a new insight into the maximum entropy function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents further insights into a recently developed round-trip communication scheme called ``Secret-message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes (STEEP)''. A legitimate wireless channel between a multi-antenna user (Alice) and a single-antenna user (Bob) in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) is focused on. STEEP does not require full-duplex, channel reciprocity or Eve's channel state information, but is able to yield a positive secrecy rate in bits per channel use between Alice and Bob in every channel coherence period as long as Eve's receive channel is not noiseless. This secrecy rate does not diminish as coherence time increases. Various statistical behaviors of STEEP's secrecy capacity due to random channel fading are also illustrated.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is a weak version of algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain or quantify selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory, pathway complexity, the assembly index, and the assembly number are subsumed and constitute a weak version of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity reliant on an approximation method based upon statistical compression, their results obtained due to the use of methods strictly equivalent to the LZ family of compression algorithms used in compressing algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT's assembly index and their use had already been reported in successful application to separating organic from non-organic molecules, and the study of selection and evolution. Here we exhibit and prove the connections and full equivalence of Assembly Theory to Shannon Entropy and statistical compression, and AT's disconnection as a statistical approach from causality. We demonstrate that formulating a traditional statistically compressed description of molecules, or the theory underlying it, does not imply an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by selection and evolution, when lacking in logical consistency and empirical evidence. We argue that in their basic arguments, the authors of AT conflate how objects may assemble with causal directionality, and conclude that Assembly Theory does nothing to explain selection or evolution beyond known and previously established connections, some of which are reviewed here, based on sounder theory and better experimental evidence.</description>

Abstract: In the context of interstellar communication, it is not known beforehand if the receiver of a given signal would be a plant, an insect, or even life forms unknown to terrestrial scientists. Regardless of the situation, the message time scale could be too fast or too slow and those beings would probably never decode it. Therefore, it is of interest to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of time scale. Fractal messaging would allow one to do this due to their structural self-similarity and, sometimes, scale invariance. By starting from a spatial embedding rationale, a framework is developed for a time scale-free messaging alternative. When one considers a time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded along several spatio-temporal scales. This way, the core idea of the framework hereby proposed is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many (power-like distributed) frequencies and amplitudes, transmit such message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as the carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a time-agnostic approach to messaging.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Rate of In-Band Full-duplex Two-way Wiretap Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a two-way wiretap Multi-Input Multi-Output Multi-antenna Eve (MIMOME) channel, where both nodes (Alice and Bob) transmit and receive in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) manner. For this system with keyless security, we provide a novel artificial noise (AN) based signal design, where the AN is injected in both signal and null spaces. We present an ergodic secrecy rate approximation to derive the power allocation algorithm. We consider scenarios where AN is known and unknown to legitimate users and include imperfect channel information effects. To maximize secrecy rates subject to the transmit power constraint, a two-step power allocation solution is proposed, where the first step is known at Eve, and the second step helps to improve the secrecy further. We also consider scenarios where partial information is known by Eve and the effects of non-ideal self-interference cancellation. The usefulness and limitations of the resulting power allocation solution are analyzed and verified via simulations. Results show that secrecy rates are less when AN is unknown to receivers or Eve has more information about legitimate users. Since the ergodic approximation only considers Eves distance, the resulting power allocation provides secrecy rates close to the actual ones.</description>

      <title>Advanced Channel Coding Designs for Index-Modulated Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of fluid antennas (FAs) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks, achieved by introducing additional degrees of freedom, including reconfigurability and flexibility. In this paper, we investigate the use of index-modulated (IM) transmissions within the framework of FA systems, where an FA position is activated during each transmission interval. This approach is motivated by the common characteristics exhibited by FAs and IM transmissions, which entails the use of a single radio-frequency chain. From this perspective, we derive a closed-form expression for the bit error rate of IM-FAs considering spatial correlation, and demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional IM systems. To enhance the performance of IM-FAs in correlated conditions, channel coding techniques are applied. We first analyze a set partition coding (SPC) scheme for IM-FAs to spatially separate the FA ports, and provide a tight performance bound over correlated channels. Furthermore, the spatial SPC scheme is extended to turbo-coded modulation where the performance is analyzed for low and high signal-to-noise ratios. Our results reveal that through the implementation of channel coding techniques designed for FAs and IM transmission, the performance of coded IM-FAs exhibits notable enhancements, particularly in high correlation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One indication of thermalization time is subsystem entanglement reaching thermal values. Recent studies on local quantum circuits reveal two exponential stages with decay rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ of the purity before and after thermalization. We provide an entanglement membrane theory interpretation, with $r_1$ corresponding to the domain wall free energy. Circuit geometry can lead to $r_1 &lt; r_2$, producing a ``phantom eigenvalue". Competition between the domain wall and magnon leads to $r_2 &lt; r_1$ when the magnon prevails. However, when the domain wall wins, this mechanism provides a practical approach for measuring entanglement growth through local correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negation is a important perspective of knowledge representation. Existing negation methods are mainly applied in probability theory, evidence theory and complex evidence theory. As a generalization of evidence theory, random permutation sets theory may represent information more precisely. However, how to apply the concept of negation to random permutation sets theory has not been studied. In this paper, the negation of permutation mass function is proposed. Moreover, in the negation process, the convergence of proposed negation method is verified. The trends of uncertainty and dissimilarity after each negation operation are investigated. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unobserved Common Causes based on NML Code in Discrete, Mixed, and Continuous Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery in the presence of unobserved common causes from observational data only is a crucial but challenging problem. We categorize all possible causal relationships between two random variables into the following four categories and aim to identify one from observed data: two cases in which either of the direct causality exists, a case that variables are independent, and a case that variables are confounded by latent confounders. Although existing methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they require unobserved variables to satisfy assumptions on the form of their equation models. In our previous study (Kobayashi et al., 2022), the first causal discovery method without such assumptions is proposed for discrete data and named CLOUD. Using Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) Code, CLOUD selects a model that yields the minimum codelength of the observed data from a set of model candidates. This paper extends CLOUD to apply for various data types across discrete, mixed, and continuous. We not only performed theoretical analysis to show the consistency of CLOUD in terms of the model selection, but also demonstrated that CLOUD is more effective than existing methods in inferring causal relationships by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Learning Over the Air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a federated version of adaptive gradient methods, particularly AdaGrad and Adam, within the framework of over-the-air model training. This approach capitalizes on the inherent superposition property of wireless channels, facilitating fast and scalable parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, it enhances the robustness of the model training process by dynamically adjusting the stepsize in accordance with the global gradient update. We derive the convergence rate of the training algorithms, encompassing the effects of channel fading and interference, for a broad spectrum of nonconvex loss functions. Our analysis shows that the AdaGrad-based algorithm converges to a stationary point at the rate of $\mathcal{O}( \ln{(T)} /{ T^{ 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha} } } )$, where $\alpha$ represents the tail index of the electromagnetic interference. This result indicates that the level of heavy-tailedness in interference distribution plays a crucial role in the training efficiency: the heavier the tail, the slower the algorithm converges. In contrast, an Adam-like algorithm converges at the $\mathcal{O}( 1/T )$ rate, demonstrating its advantage in expediting the model training process. We conduct extensive experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and affirm the practical efficacy of our proposed federated adaptive gradient methods.</description>

      <title>A representation-learning game for classes of prediction tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a game-based formulation for learning dimensionality-reducing representations of feature vectors, when only a prior knowledge on future prediction tasks is available. In this game, the first player chooses a representation, and then the second player adversarially chooses a prediction task from a given class, representing the prior knowledge. The first player aims is to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. For the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and under the mean squared error loss function, we derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation. For general representations and loss functions, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize a randomized representation. The algorithm only requires the gradients of the loss function, and is based on incrementally adding a representation rule to a mixture of such rules.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based CSI Feedback for RIS-assisted Multi-user Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.03303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communications, efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is paramount. This paper introduces RIS-CoCsiNet, a novel deep learning-based framework designed to greatly enhance feedback efficiency. By leveraging the inherent correlation among proximate user equipments (UEs), our approach strategically categorizes RIS-UE CSI into shared and unique data sets. This nuanced understanding allows for significant reductions in feedback overhead, as the shared data is no longer redundantly relayed. Setting RIS-CoCsiNet apart from traditional autoencoder systems, we incorporate an additional decoder and a combination neural network at the base station. These enhancements are tasked with the precise retrieval and fusion of shared and individual data. And notably, all these innovations are achieved without modifying the UEs. For those UEs boasting multiple antennas, our design seamlessly integrates long short-term memory modules, capturing the intricate correlations between antennas. With a recognition of the non-sparse nature of the RIS-UE CSI phase, we pioneer two magnitude-dependent phase feedback strategies. These strategies adeptly weave in both statistical and real-time CSI magnitude data. The potency of RIS-CoCsiNet is further solidified through compelling simulation results drawn from two diverse channel datasets.</description>

Abstract: The family of bent functions is a known class of Boolean functions, which have a great importance in cryptography. The Cayley graph defined on $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ by the support of a bent function is a strongly regular graph $srg(v,k\lambda,\mu)$, with $\lambda=\mu$. In this note we list the parameters of such Cayley graphs. Moreover, it is given a condition on $(n,m)$-bent functions $F=(f_1,\ldots,f_m)$, involving the support of their components $f_i$, and their $n$-ary symmetric differences.</description>

      <title>UL-DL duality for cell-free massive MIMO with per-AP power and information constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel uplink-downlink duality principle for optimal joint precoding design under per-transmitter power and information constraints in fading channels. The information constraints model limited sharing of channel state information and data bearing signals across the transmitters. The main application is to cell-free networks, where each access point (AP) must typically satisfy an individual power constraint and form its transmit signal using limited cooperation capabilities. Our duality principle applies to ergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be interpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan for deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to study involved information constraints going beyond the simple case of cluster-wise centralized precoding covered by previous techniques. Specifically, we show that the optimal joint precoders are, in general, given by an extension of the recently developed team minimum mean-square error method. As a particular yet practical example, we then solve the problem of optimal local precoding design in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power constraints.</description>

      <title>Fairness Scheduling in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with $L$ remote radio units, each with $M$ antennas, serving $K_{\rm tot}$ user equipments (UEs). Most of the literature considers the regime $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$, where the $K$ UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas, but users are not all active at the same time. To achieve high sum SE and handle $K_{\rm tot} \gg ML$, users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\rm act} \leq K_{\rm tot}$ must be chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. Intermittent user activity imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding which prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. To obtain a tractable problem, we make a decoupling assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE $k$ receiver. We approximately enforce this condition with a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is robust to system model uncertainties and can be easily implemented in practice.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-dense cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology expected to meet the future ubiquitous connectivity requirements and ever-growing data traffic demands in 6G. This article provides a contemporary overview of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO networks, and addresses important unresolved questions on their future deployment. We first present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research on CF-MMIMO and ultra-dense networks. Then, we discuss the key challenges of CF-MMIMO under ultra-dense scenarios such as low-complexity architecture and processing, low-complexity/scalable resource allocation, fronthaul limitation, massive access, synchronization, and channel acquisition. Finally, we answer key open questions, considering different design comparisons and discussing suitable methods dealing with the key challenges of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO. The discussion aims to provide a valuable roadmap for interesting future research directions in this area, facilitating the development of CF-MMIMO MIMO for 6G.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication networks, users may be within the coverage of multiple access points (AP), which typically employ large-scale antenna arrays to mitigate obstacle occlusion and path loss. However, large-scale arrays generate pencil-shaped beams, which necessitate a higher number of training beams to cover the desired space. Furthermore, as the antenna aperture increases, users are more likely to be situated in the near-field region of the AP antenna array. This motivates our investigation into the near-field beam training problem to achieve effective positioning services. To address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first construct a near-field single-beam training codebook for the uniform planar arrays. Then, the hash functions are chosen independently to construct the multi-arm beam training codebooks for each AP. All APs traverse the predefined multi-arm beam training codeword simultaneously and the multi-AP superimposed signals at the user are recorded. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to obtain the correctly aligned beams only based on the signal powers. In addition, we logically prove that the traversal complexity is at the logarithmic level. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of the exhaustive beam training method and greatly reduce the training overhead. Furthermore, we verify its applicability under the far-field scenario as well.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging the Gap between Near and Far-Field Characterizations of the Wireless Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "near-field" propagation modeling of wireless channels is necessary to support sixth-generation (6G) technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), that are enabled by large aperture antennas and higher frequency carriers. As the conventional far-field model proves inadequate in this context, there is a pressing need to explore and bridge the gap between near and far-field propagation models. Although far-field models are simple and provide computationally efficient solutions for many practical applications, near-field models provide the most accurate representation of wireless channels. This paper builds upon the foundations of electromagnetic wave propagation theory to derive near and far-field models as approximations of the Green's function (Maxwell's equations). We characterize the near and far-field models both theoretically and with the help of simulations in a line-of-sight (LOS)-only scenario. In particular, for two key applications in multiantenna systems, namely, beamforming and multiple-access, we showcase the advantages of using the near-field model over the far-field, and present a novel scheduling scheme for multiple-access in the near-field regime. Our findings offer insights into the challenge of incorporating near-field models in practical wireless systems, fostering enhanced performance in future communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultimate linear block and convolutional codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear block code over a field can be derived from a unit scheme. Looking at codes as structures within a unit scheme greatly extends the availability of linear block and convolutional codes and allows the construction of the codes to required length, rate, distance and type. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. %% can thus be constructed and analysed by designating the units whose properties would give the required codes.
  Orthogonal units, units in group rings, Fourier/Vandermonde units and related units are used to construct and analyse linear block and convolutional codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate, distance and type. Self-dual, dual containing, quantum error-correcting and complementary dual linear block and convolutional codes are constructed.
  Low density parity check linear block and convolutional codes are constructed using group rings and are constructed with no short cycles in the control matrix.
  From a single unit, multiple codes of a required type are derivable.</description>

      <title>Quantifying intrinsic causal contributions via structure preserving interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.00714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a notion of causal influence that describes the `intrinsic' part of the contribution of a node on a target node in a DAG. By recursively writing each node as a function of the upstream noise terms, we separate the intrinsic information added by each node from the one obtained from its ancestors. To interpret the intrinsic information as a {\it causal} contribution, we consider `structure-preserving interventions' that randomize each node in a way that mimics the usual dependence on the parents and does not perturb the observed joint distribution. To get a measure that is invariant with respect to relabelling nodes we use Shapley based symmetrization and show that it reduces in the linear case to simple ANOVA after resolving the target node into noise variables. We describe our contribution analysis for variance and entropy, but contributions for other target metrics can be defined analogously. The code is available in the package gcm of the open source library DoWhy.</description>

      <title>Theory and applications of the Sum-Of-Squares technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sum-of-Squares (SOS) approximation method is a technique used in optimization problems to derive lower bounds on the optimal value of an objective function. By representing the objective function as a sum of squares in a feature space, the SOS method transforms non-convex global optimization problems into solvable semidefinite programs. This note presents an overview of the SOS method. We start with its application in finite-dimensional feature spaces and, subsequently, we extend it to infinite-dimensional feature spaces using reproducing kernels (k-SOS). Additionally, we highlight the utilization of SOS for estimating some relevant quantities in information theory, including the log-partition function.</description>

      <title>Practical Implementation of RIS-Aided Spectrum Sensing: A Deep Learning-Based Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided deep learning (DL)-based spectrum sensing for next-generation cognitive radios. To that end, the secondary user (SU) monitors the primary transmitter (PT) signal, where the RIS plays a pivotal role in increasing the strength of the PT signal at the SU. The spectrograms of the synthesized dataset, including the 4G LTE and 5G NR signals, are mapped to images utilized for training the state-of-art object detection approaches, namely Detectron2 and YOLOv7. By conducting extensive experiments using a real RIS prototype, we demonstrate that the RIS can consistently and significantly improve the performance of the DL detectors to identify the PT signal type along with its time and frequency utilization. This study also paves the way for optimizing spectrum utilization through RIS-assisted CR application in next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for large-scale multi-agent molecular communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is recently featured as a novel communication tool to connect individual biological nanorobots. It is expected that a large number of nanorobots can form large multi-agent MC systems through MC to accomplish complex and large-scale tasks that cannot be achieved by a single nanorobot. However, most previous models for MC systems assume a unidirectional diffusion communication channel and cannot capture the feedback between each nanorobot, which is important for multi-agent MC systems. In this paper, we introduce a system theoretic model for large-scale multi-agent MC systems using transfer functions, and then propose a method to analyze the stability for multi-agent MC systems. The proposed method decomposes the multi-agent MC system into multiple single-input and single-output (SISO) systems, which facilitates the application of simple analysis technique for SISO systems to the large-scale multi-agent MC system. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method by analyzing the stability of a specific large-scale multi-agent MC system and clarify a parameter region to synchronize the states of nanorobots, which is important to make cooperative behaviors at a population level.</description>

      <title>Learning Unknown Intervention Targets in Structural Causal Models from Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the unknown intervention targets in structural causal models where we have access to heterogeneous data collected from multiple environments. The unknown intervention targets are the set of endogenous variables whose corresponding exogenous noises change across the environments. We propose a two-phase approach which in the first phase recovers the exogenous noises corresponding to unknown intervention targets whose distributions have changed across environments. In the second phase, the recovered noises are matched with the corresponding endogenous variables. For the recovery phase, we provide sufficient conditions for learning these exogenous noises up to some component-wise invertible transformation. For the matching phase, under the causal sufficiency assumption, we show that the proposed method uniquely identifies the intervention targets. In the presence of latent confounders, the intervention targets among the observed variables cannot be determined uniquely. We provide a candidate intervention target set which is a superset of the true intervention targets. Our approach improves upon the state of the art as the returned candidate set is always a subset of the target set returned by previous work. Moreover, we do not require restrictive assumptions such as linearity of the causal model or performing invariance tests to learn whether a distribution is changing across environments which could be highly sample inefficient. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in practice.</description>

      <title>Optical Integrated Sensing and Communication: Architectures, Potentials and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a crucial component of future mobile networks and has gained much interest in both academia and industry. Similar to the emergence of radio-frequency (RF) ISAC, the integration of free space optical communication and optical sensing yields optical ISAC (O-ISAC), which is regarded as a powerful complement to its RF counterpart. In this article, we first introduce the generalized system structure of O-ISAC, and then elaborate on three advantages of O-ISAC, i.e., increasing communication rate, enhancing sensing precision, and reducing interference. Next, waveform design and resource allocation of O-ISAC are discussed based on pulsed waveform, constant-modulus waveform, and multi-carrier waveform. Furthermore, we put forward future trends and challenges of O-ISAC, which are expected to provide some valuable directions for future research.</description>
