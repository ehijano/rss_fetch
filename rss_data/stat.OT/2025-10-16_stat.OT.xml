      <title>Power-laws in phylogenetic trees and the preferential coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among species and reflect the forces that shaped them. While many studies rely on branch length information, the topology of phylogenetic trees (particularly their degree of imbalance) offers a robust framework for inferring evolutionary dynamics when timing data is uncertain. Classical metrics, such as the Colless and Sackin indices, quantify tree imbalance and have been extensively used to characterize phylogenies. Empirical phylogenies typically show intermediate imbalance, falling between perfectly balanced and highly skewed trees. This regime is marked by a power-law relationship between subtree sizes and their cumulative sizes, governed by a characteristic exponent. Although a recent niche-size model replicates this scaling, its mathematical origin and the exponent's value remain unclear. We present a generative model inspired by Kingman's coalescent that incorporates niche-like dynamics through preferential node coalescence. This process maps to Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics and is described by a generalized Smoluchowski equation. Our model produces imbalanced trees with power-law exponents matching empirical and numerical observations, revealing the mathematical basis of observed scaling laws and offering new tools to interpret tree imbalance in evolutionary contexts.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Using the Relative Importance Measures Based on Orthonormality Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of relative importance measures based on orthonormality transformation (OTMs), has been found to effectively approximate the General Dominance index (GD). In particular, Johnson's Relative Weight (RW) has been deemed the most successful OTM in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical foundation of the OTMs remains unclear. To further understand the OTMs, we provide a generalized framework that breaks down the OTM into two functional steps: orthogonalization and reallocation. To assess the impact of each step on the performance of OTMs, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations under various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions. Our findings reveal that Johnson's minimal transformation consistently outperforms other common orthogonalization methods. We also summarize the performance of reallocation methods under four scenarios of predictors' correlation structures in terms of the first principal component and the variance inflation factor (VIF). This analysis provides guidelines for selecting appropriate reallocation methods in different scenarios, illustrated with real-world dataset examples. Our research offers a deeper understanding of OTMs and provides valuable insights for practitioners seeking to accurately measure variable importance in various modeling contexts.</description>

      <title>Examining the Interface Design of Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidyverse is a popular meta-package comprising several core R packages to aid in various data science tasks, including data import, manipulation and visualisation. Although functionalities offered by the tidyverse can generally be replicated using other packages, its widespread adoption in both teaching and practice indicates there are factors contributing to its preference, despite some debate over its usage. This suggests that particular aspects, such as interface design, may play a significant role in its selection. Examining the interface design can potentially reveal aspects that aid the design process for developers. While Tidyverse has been lauded for adopting a user-centered design, arguably some elements of the design focus on the work domain instead of the end-user. We examine the Tidyverse interface design via the lens of human computer interaction, with an emphasis on data visualisation and data wrangling, to identify factors that might serve as a model for developers designing their packages. We recommend that developers adopt an iterative design that is informed by user feedback, analysis and complete coverage of the work domain, and ensure perceptual visibility of system constraints and relationships.</description>
