      <title>A near-optimal Quadratic Goldreich-Levin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a quadratic Goldreich-Levin algorithm that is close to optimal in the following ways. Given a bounded function $f$ on the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the algorithm returns a quadratic polynomial $q: \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{F}_2$ so that the correlation of $f$ with the function $(-1)^q$ is within an additive $\varepsilon$ of the maximum possible correlation with a quadratic phase function. The algorithm runs in $O_\varepsilon(n^3)$ time and makes $O_\varepsilon(n^2\log n)$ queries to $f$, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ queries up to a logarithmic factor.
  As a result, we obtain a number of corollaries:
  - A near-optimal self-corrector of quadratic Reed-Muller codes, which makes $O_\varepsilon(n^2\log n)$ queries to a Boolean function $f$ and returns a quadratic polynomial $q$ whose relative Hamming distance to $f$ is within $\varepsilon$ of the minimum distance.
  - An algorithmic polynomial inverse theorem for the order-3 Gowers uniformity norm.
  - An algorithm that makes a polynomial number of queries to a bounded function $f$ and decomposes $f$ as a sum of poly$(1/\varepsilon)$ quadratic phase functions and error terms of order $\varepsilon$.
  Our algorithm is obtained using ideas from recent work on quantum learning theory. Its construction deviates from previous approaches based on algorithmic proofs of the inverse theorem for the order-3 uniformity norm (and in particular does not rely on the recent resolution of the polynomial Fre\u{\i}man-Ruzsa conjecture).</description>

      <title>Counting Graphlets of Size $k$ under Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of counting subgraphs or graphlets under local differential privacy is an important challenge that has attracted significant attention from researchers. However, much of the existing work focuses on small graphlets like triangles or $k$-stars. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive, locally differentially private algorithm capable of counting graphlets of any size $k$. When $n$ is the number of nodes in the input graph, we show that the expected $\ell_2$ error of our algorithm is $O(n^{k - 1})$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a class of input graphs and graphlets of size $k$ for which any non-interactive counting algorithm incurs an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1})$, demonstrating the optimality of our result. Furthermore, we establish that for certain input graphs and graphlets, any locally differentially private algorithm must have an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1.5})$. Our experimental results show that our algorithm is more accurate than the classical randomized response method.</description>

      <title>Inverse Intersections for Boolean Satisfiability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems are expressed as mathematical formulas. This paper presents a matrix representation for these SAT problems.
  It shows how to use this matrix representation to get the full set of valid satisfying variable assignments. It proves that this is the set of answers for the given problem and is exponential in size relative to the matrix.
  It presents a simple algorithm that utilizes the inverse of each clause to find an intersection for the matrix. This gives a satisfying variable assignment.</description>

      <title>Diversity-aware clustering: Computational Complexity and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study diversity-aware clustering problems where the data points are associated with multiple attributes resulting in intersecting groups. A clustering solution needs to ensure that the number of chosen cluster centers from each group should be within the range defined by a lower and upper bound threshold for each group, while simultaneously minimizing the clustering objective, which can be either $k$-median, $k$-means or $k$-supplier. We study the computational complexity of the proposed problems, offering insights into their NP-hardness, polynomial-time inapproximability, and fixed-parameter intractability. We present parameterized approximation algorithms with approximation ratios $1+ \frac{2}{e} + \epsilon \approx 1.736$, $1+\frac{8}{e} + \epsilon \approx 3.943$, and $5$ for diversity-aware $k$-median, diversity-aware $k$-means and diversity-aware $k$-supplier, respectively. Assuming Gap-ETH, the approximation ratios are tight for the diversity-aware $k$-median and diversity-aware $k$-means problems. Our results imply the same approximation factors for their respective fair variants with disjoint groups -- fair $k$-median, fair $k$-means, and fair $k$-supplier -- with lower bound requirements.</description>

      <title>New Lower-bounds for Quantum Computation with Non-Collapsing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons and Lee introduced the complexity class PDQP (which was original labeled naCQP), an alteration of BQP enhanced with the ability to obtain non-collapsing measurements, samples of quantum states without collapsing them. Although PDQP contains SZK, it still requires $\Omega(N^{1/4})$ queries to solve unstructured search. We formulate an alternative equivalent definition of PDQP, which we use to prove the positive weighted adversary lower-bounding method, establishing multiple tighter bounds and a trade-off between queries and non-collapsing measurements. We utilize the technique in order to analyze the query complexity of the well-studied majority and element distinctness problems. Additionally, we prove a tight $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ bound on search. Furthermore, we use the lower-bound to explore PDQP under query restrictions, finding that when combined with non-adaptive queries, we limit the speed-up in several cases.</description>

      <title>The Jacobi Factoring Circuit: Quantum Factoring with Near-Linear Gates and Sublinear Space and Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a compact quantum circuit for factoring a large class of integers, including some whose classical hardness is expected to be equivalent to RSA (but not including RSA integers themselves). Most notably, we factor $n$-bit integers of the form $P^2 Q$ with $\log Q = \Theta(n^a)$ for $a \in (2/3, 1)$ in space and depth sublinear in n (specifically, $\tilde{O}(\log Q)$) using $\tilde{O}(n)$ quantum gates; for these integers, no known classical algorithms exploit the relatively small size of $Q$ to run asymptotically faster than general-purpose factoring algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time circuit to achieve sublinear qubit count for a classically-hard factoring problem. We thus believe that factoring such numbers has potential to be the most concretely efficient classically-verifiable proof of quantumness currently known.
  Our circuit builds on the quantum algorithm for squarefree decomposition discovered by Li, Peng, Du, and Suter (Nature Scientific Reports 2012), which relies on computing the Jacobi symbol in quantum superposition. The technical core of our contribution is a new space-efficient quantum algorithm to compute the Jacobi symbol of $A$ mod $B$, in the regime where $B$ is classical and much larger than $A$. Our circuit for computing the Jacobi symbol generalizes to related problems such as computing the greatest common divisor and modular inverses, and thus could be of independent interest.</description>
