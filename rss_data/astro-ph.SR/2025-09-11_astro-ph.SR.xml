      <title>Analysis of mass-transferring binary candidates in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer between stars in binary systems profoundly impacts their evolution, yet many aspects of this process (especially the stability, mass loss, and eventual fate of such systems) remain poorly understood. One promising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and characterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the slow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to identify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a Hertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using the Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate mass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission features (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from WISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the Gaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67 candidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing binaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in our sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow component, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in our sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on their UV or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search are hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional outcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars, selected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line criteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher fraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.</description>

      <title>Toward a 2D H I Map of the Local Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a complete census of gas in the local interstellar medium (&lt;100 pc) is challenging given the limited available tracers of the warm, partially-ionized medium. Medium-to-high resolution UV absorption spectroscopy toward individual nearby stars is the primary method used, and incomplete spatial sampling of this complex medium makes a global map of the material difficult. Using H I column density measurements derived from H I Lyman alpha spectroscopy toward 164 stars inside 100 pc, we have generated 2D spatially-interpolated N(HI) maps for different distance shells. Based on the area-weighted sky averages, we find that sightlines inside 10 pc typically have log N(HI) ~ 17.9. For greater distance shells, log N(HI) increases to 18.3 (10-20 pc), then to 18.4 (20-70 pc), and finally increasing to 18.6 (70-100 pc). This last increase is likely associated with the detection of the Local Bubble boundary, thus making the plateau of column density from 20-70 pc notable and suggestive of the rarity of warm LISM material beyond ~10-20 pc. We estimate that the uncertainties associated with N(HI) values inferred from the interpolated sky maps are approximately inversely correlated with the number of samples in each distance shell and are in the range of 0.20-0.48 dex, compared to 0.01-0.30 dex typically determined from direct Lyman alpha observations. We discuss the impact of these uncertainties on ISM corrections of EUV and Lyman alpha observations for nearby stars. Denser spatial sampling of the sky via UV absorption spectroscopy of nearby stars is required to improve the accuracy of these N(HI) estimates.</description>

      <title>A neural network model for quickly solving multiple-band light curves of contact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large-scale photometric surveys has led to the discovery of over a million contact binary systems. Conventional light curve analysis methods are no longer adequate for handling such massive datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a neural network-based model capable of rapid analysis of multiple-band light curves of contact binaries. Our model can determine the fundamental physical parameters, including temperature and mass ratios, orbital inclination, potential, fillout factor, primary and secondary luminosities and radii, third light contribution, and spot parameters. Notably, unlike previous works, our model can simultaneously process multiple-band light curves and the four parameters of a starspot. The model's reliability was verified through analysis of the synthetic light curves generated by PHOEBE and the light curves of eight targets from \cite{2024ApJ...976..223W}'s work. The discrepancy distribution between the physical parameters determined by our model and true values for the synthetic light curves shows very good agreement. In addition, the physical parameters determined by our model and the corresponding light curve fits show remarkable consistency with \cite{2024ApJ...976..223W}'s results. By applying our model to OGLE contact binaries, physical parameters of 3,541 systems were obtained. We have packaged our model into an executable (CBLA.exe) file and archived it in the China-VO repository (https://doi.org/10.12149/101626). The software supports light curve analysis of 19 standard filters and allows for processing the data, whether from large-scale sky surveys or individual telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary disks around magnetized young stars with large-scale magnetic fields I: Steady-state solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the large-scale field topology of protoplanetary disks faces significant difficulties and uncertainties. The transport of the large-scale field inside the disk plays an important role in understanding its evolution. We aim to improve our understanding of the dependencies that stellar magnetic fields pose on the large-scale field. We focus on the innermost disk region ($\lesssim$ 0.1 AU), which is crucial for understanding the long-term disk evolution. We present a novel approach combining the evolution of a 1+1D hydrodynamic disk with a large-scale magnetic field, consisting of a stellar dipole truncating the disk and a fossil field. The magnetic flux transport includes advection and diffusion due to laminar, non-ideal MHD effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. Due to the implicit nature of the numerical method, long-term simulations (in the order of several viscous timescales) are feasible. The large-scale magnetic field topology in stationary models shows a distinct dependence on specific parameters. The innermost disk region is strongly affected by the stellar rotation period and magnetic field strength. The outer disk regions are affected by the X-ray luminosity and the fossil field. Varying the mass flow through the disk affects the large-scale disk field throughout its radial extent. The topology of the large-scale disk field is affected by several stellar and disk parameters. This will affect the efficiency of MHD outflows, which depend on the magnetic field topology. Such outflows might originate from the very inner disk region, the dead zone, or the outer disk. In subsequent studies, we will use these models as a starting point for conducting long-term evolution simulations of the disk and large-scale field on scales of $\sim$ 106 years to investigate the combined evolution of the disk, the magnetic field topology, and the resulting MHD outflows.</description>

      <title>Pulsations in Binary Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision and long-duration light curves from space telescopes have revolutionized the fields of asteroseismology and binary star systems. In particular, the number of pulsating systems in eclipsing binaries has drastically increased thanks to space-based observations covering almost the entire sky. When combined with multi-epoch spectroscopy, this allows us not only to measure model-independent dynamical masses and radii for thousands of eclipsing binary systems, but also facilitates the powerful synergy of binarity and asteroseismology. Moreover, asteroseismology of pre- and post-interaction binary stars allows the physics of binary evolution to be constrained, including tides, mass transfer, and even mergers. We conclude that: (1) eclipsing binaries are among the best laboratories for testing stellar structure and evolution theory because we are able to measure their masses and radii independently of models; (2) combining binary and asteroseismic modeling yields precise constraints on the physical processes at work within stellar interiors, such as rotation and mixing; (3) pulsating binaries are challenging to study given the plethora of different techniques and physical processes that need to be considered depending on their orbital and physical properties; and (4) the impact of tides on the pulsational, stellar structure, and orbital properties of a binary system can be tested through tidal asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Modeling brightness temperature of prominences on the solar disk using ALMA single-dish observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominences (PRs) are among the most common solar phenomena, yet their full physical picture, particularly their chromospheric mm emission, remains incomplete. The new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) presents an opportunity to study PRs at mm and sub-mm wavelengths through a combination of measurements and theoretical modeling. We utilize ALMA single-dish measurements alongside data from other radio instruments to model the PR brightness temperature through adaptation and modification the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-W\"ulser (ATLCW) quiet-Sun (QS) model. The calculated and measured PR brightness temperatures were found to be lower than the measured QS value and predictions from the unperturbed ATLCW QS model across the ALMA wavelength range, consistent with PRs appearing in absorption. The PR density was found to be 60 - 163 times higher and temperature 155 - 163 times lower than the QS level, aligning with previous measurements. A key finding emerged with the non-hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, yielding a more physically consistent PR brightness temperature. This suggests that PR stability is most likely maintained by its magnetic field obeying magnetostatic conditions rather than by pure hydrostatic equilibrium, supporting recent studies. Additionally, our results confirm that thermal bremsstrahlung is the dominant radiation mechanism for PRs at mm and sub-mm wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Formation of chromospheric Fe I lines in the near ultraviolet in 1D atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near ultraviolet (NUV) part of the solar spectrum, there are several Fe I lines with very broad profiles, typical of chromospheric lines. These lines are largely unexplored due to the lack of high-resolution data in this region. This changed with the successful Sunrise III flight in 2024, when spectro-polarimetric data were recorded with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution covering a large variety of solar targets. The aim of this work is to investigate the formation of the lines and lay the groundwork for further studies. We compute the spectrum of the lines at 358.12 nm, 371.99 nm, 406.36 nm, and 407.17 nm emerging from the standard 1D FAL-atmospheres using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code RH. We find that the lines are affected by overionization in the wings, but have line cores strongly affected by scattering. The line cores form well into the chromosphere in the tested atmosphere models except the colder FALX model where the line core forms in the temperature minimum (which lies at traditional chromospheric heights). In the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the Stokes $V$ signal is multi-lobed. The profile can be decomposed into two broad photospheric lobes and two sharper lobes forming in the flanks of the chromospheric line core. We have investigated the properties of four lines of Fe I that form in the lower chromosphere. The results provide a basic understanding of the formation of the lines, which will be useful for later analysis of formation in 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and an eventual investigation into their diagnostic potential.</description>

      <title>Probing accretion and stellar properties in the Orion Nebula with VLT/X-Shooter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple photometric studies have reported the presence of seemingly older accreting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) in optical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We investigate this phenomenon in the Orion Nebula, which harbors a subset of stars that show infrared excess detected by Spitzer and Halpha excess emission, yet display significantly older isochronal ages (&gt;10 Myr) compared to the bulk population (~1-3 Myr) in the r, (r-i) CMD. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 40 Orion Nebula stars using VLT/X-Shooter, covering CMD-based isochronal ages from 1 to over 30 Myr. We derive extinction values, stellar properties, and accretion parameters by modeling the ultraviolet excess emission through a multicomponent fitting procedure. The sample spans spectral types from M4.5 up to K6, and masses in the range ~0.1-0.8 Msun. We demonstrate that, when extinction and, most importantly, accretion effects are accurately constrained, the stellar luminosity and effective temperature of the majority of the seemingly old stars become consistent with a younger population (~1-5 Myr). This is supported by strong lithium absorption, which corroborates their youth, and by the accretion-to-stellar luminosity ratios typical for young, accreting stars. Three of these sources, however, remain old even after our analysis, despite showing signatures consistent with ongoing accretion from a protoplanetary disc. More generally, our analysis indicates that excess continuum emission from accretion shocks affects the placement of PMS stars in the CMD, displacing sources towards bluer optical colours. This study highlights the critical role of accretion in shaping the stellar properties estimates (including age) derived from optical CMDs and emphasizes the need to carefully account for accretion effects when interpreting age distributions in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Merger Scenario for GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 exhibits exceedingly massive components and high spins, which challenges the formation of first-generation (1G) black holes from stellar collapse and implies that this event might originate from hierarchical mergers. Here we show that the \texttt{2G+2G} merger scenario for GW231123 is favored over a \texttt{2G+1G} (or \texttt{3G+2G}) merger, with odds ratios of $&gt;$$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The primary (secondary) black hole is consistent with merging binary black holes with masses of $75^{+7}_{-7}\,M_\odot$ and $66^{+4}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ ($64^{+8}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ and $59^{+7}_{-9}\,M_\odot$; 90\% credible intervals), respectively. Our results reveal that the treatment of spin priors from the population level and waveform model choice are decisive in interpreting potential hierarchical gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>The Small Magellanic Cloud through the lens of the James Webb Space Telescope : binaries and mass function within the galaxy outskirts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\rm F322W2}$ versus $m_{\rm F115W}-m_{\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}^{q&gt;0.6}=0.14\pm0.01$, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to $0.22\,M_{\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of $\alpha=-1.99\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of $\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Constraining Brown Dwarf Desert Formation Mechanisms Through Statistical Comparison of Observed and Simulated Orbital Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of brown dwarf companions to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed "brown dwarf desert", the notable paucity of brown dwarf companions, at orbital separations between 0.1 and 5 AU. Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and orbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three proposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias through dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models. The disk migration model provides the best statistical fit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal parameters {\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The formation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value = 0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion scenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\times}10^-17) despite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering The Bailey Diagrams of ab-type RR Lyrae Stars, Metallicity-Mediated Evolution as the Direct Cause of the Oosterhoff Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the Bailey diagrams of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars from the perspective of horizontal branch (HB) evolution, identifying evolutionary effects as the probable direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. By establishing empirical relationships between pulsation amplitude and average effective temperature, and utilizing pulsation period relations from nonlinear models, we transform theoretical HB evolutionary parameters into pulsation space and map them onto Bailey diagrams. We find that all pulsating Zero-Age Horizontal Branch stars fall within the Oosterhoff type I (OoI) region, with a pronounced period shift effect observed for relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] &gt; -1). Evolutionary tracks confirm that OoI stars are predominantly early-stage HB stars, while Oosterhoff type II stars are highly evolved objects entering the instability strip late in their HB phase from the blue side. Crucially, metallicity plays a dual role: it directly influences pulsation periods through the period relation, but more fundamentally acts as the first parameter influencing HB morphology. This morphology statistically determines whether HB stars predominantly enter the instability strip during early or late evolutionary stages. Consequently, while evolutionary effects directly govern an individual star's position in the Bailey diagram, the population-level Oosterhoff phenomenon emerges from the interplay between these effects and the metallicity-dependent HB morphology. Our study confirms that evolutionary effects are the direct drivers of the period difference and underscores metallicity's vital role in the statistical emergence of Oosterhoff groups. Continued study of this phenomenon offers key insights into the formation history of the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the red giant companions to Gaia BH2 and BH3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar companions in the binary black hole systems Gaia BH2 and BH3, both of which are $\alpha$-enhanced red giant branch stars, are expected to show normal modes with the characteristic signature of convectively-driven solar-like oscillations. We investigate this using photometry from the TESS mission and find such a signal for Gaia BH2. For Gaia BH2, we measure a power excess frequency of $\nu_{\rm max}=60.15\pm0.57$ $\mu$Hz and a large separation of $\Delta\nu=5.99\pm0.03$ $\mu$Hz, yielding a mass of $1.19^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ M$_\odot$, which is in agreement with spectroscopically derived parameters. Seismic modeling favors an age for the red giant of $5.03^{+2.58}_{-3.05}$ Gyr, strongly suggesting that it is a young, $\alpha$-enriched giant star, which are thought to arise from a binary accretion or merger scenario. Ground-based photometry of Gaia BH2 spanning 8 years indicates a photometric period of $398\pm5$ d, which we tentatively attribute to rotation. If this rotation is physical, it can not be explained solely by evolutionary spin-down or magnetic braking, and implies that the red giant underwent some tidal forcing mechanism. Suggestively, this period is close to the pseudo-synchronous spin period of P$_\text{spin}=428\pm1$ days derived from the binary orbit. For Gaia BH3, we are unable to identify an asteroseismic signal in the TESS data despite predicting that the amplitude of the signal should lie well above the measured noise level. We discuss a number of scenarios for why this signal may not be visible.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric inversion. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.</description>

      <title>Detailed Microwave Continuum Spectra from Bright Protoplanetary Disks in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\alpha_{\rm c} \approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\alpha_{\rm d} \approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\approx 1000 \, M_\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Reduced dimensional description of hydromagnetic turbulence capturing higher order fluid moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency spectra of neutron star + OB supergiant binaries: Does wind density drive persistent and flaring modes of accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries are well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. We present observations of the millimeter and radio emission of binaries where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Threads: Interlinking the Stellar Initial Mass Function from Star-Birth to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.</description>
