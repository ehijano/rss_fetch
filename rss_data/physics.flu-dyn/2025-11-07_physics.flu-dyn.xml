      <title>Variational Projection of Navier-Stokes: Fluid Mechanics as a Quadratic Programming Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauss's principle of least constraint transforms a dynamics problem into a pure minimization problem, where the total magnitude of the constraint force is the cost function, minimized at each instant. Newton's equation is the first-order necessary condition for minimizing the Gaussian cost, subject to the given kinematic constraints. The principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG) is to incompressible fluid mechanics what Gauss's principle is to particle mechanics. The PMPG asserts that an incompressible flow evolves from one instant to another by minimizing the L2-norm of the pressure gradient force. A candidate flow field whose evolution minimizes the pressure gradient cost at each instant is guaranteed to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation. Consequently, the PMPG transforms the incompressible fluid mechanics problem into a pure minimization framework, allowing one to determine the evolution of the flow field by solely focusing on minimizing the cost. In this paper, we show that the resulting minimization problem is a convex Quadratic Programming (QP) problem-one of the most computationally tractable classes in nonlinear optimization. Moreover, leveraging tools from analytical mechanics and the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses, we derive an analytical solution for this QP problem. As a result, we present an explicit formula for the projected dynamics of the spatially discretized Navier-Stokes equation on the space of divergence-free fields. The resulting ODE is ready for direct time integration, eliminating the need for solving the Poisson equation in pressure at each time step. It is typically an explicit nonlinear ODE with constant coefficients. This compact form is expected to be highly valuable for both simulation and theoretical studies, including stability analysis and flow control design. We demonstrate the framework on the lid-driven cavity problem.</description>

      <title>Thin gap approximations for microfluidic device design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 125 years ago, Henry Selby Hele-Shaw realized that the depth-averaged flow in thin gap geometries can be closely approximated by two-dimensional (2D) potential flow, in a surprising marriage between the theories of viscous-dominated and inviscid flows. Hele-Shaw flows allow visualization of potential flows over 2D airfoils and also undergird important discoveries in the dynamics of interfacial instabilities and convection, yet they have found little use in modeling flows in microfluidic devices, although these devices often have thin gap geometries. Here, we derive a Hele-Shaw approximation for the flow in the kinds of thin gap geometries created within microfluidic devices. Although these equations have been reported before, prior work used a less direct derivation. Here, we obtain them via a modified Method of Weighted Residuals (MWR), interpreting the Hele-Shaw approximation as the leading term of an orthogonal polynomial expansion that can be systematically extended to higher-order corrections. We provide substantial numerical evidence showing that approximate equations can successfully model real microfluidic and inertial-microfluidic device geometries. By reducing three-dimensional (3D) flows to 2D models, our validated model will allow for accelerated device modeling and design.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning based navigation of a jellyfish-like swimmer in flows with obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework for controlling a bio-inspired jellyfish swimmer to navigate complex fluid environments with obstacles. While existing methods often rely on kinematic and geometric states, a key challenge remains in achieving efficient obstacle avoidance under strong fluid-structure interactions and near-wall effects. We augment the agent's state representation within a soft actor-critic algorithm to include the real-time forces and torque experienced by the swimmer, providing direct mechanical feedback from vortex-wall interactions. This augmented state space enables the swimmer to perceive and interpret wall proximity and orientation through distinct hydrodynamic force signatures. We analyze how these force and torque patterns, generated by walls at different positions influence the swimmer's decision-making policy. Comparative experiments with a baseline model without force feedback demonstrate that the present one with force feedback achieves higher navigation efficiency in two-dimensional obstacle-avoidance tasks. The results show that explicit force feedback facilitates earlier, smoother maneuvers and enables the exploitation of wall effects for efficient turning behaviors. With an application to autonomous cave mapping, this work underscores the critical role of direct mechanical feedback in fluid environments and presents a physics-aware machine learning framework for advancing robust underwater exploration systems.</description>

      <title>Implementation and verification of the resolved Reynolds stress transport equations in OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of the Reynolds Stress Transport Equation (RSTE) provides fundamental physical insights that are essential for the development and validation of advanced turbulence models. However, a comprehensive and validated tool for computing the complete RSTE budget is absent in the widely-used open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework, OpenFOAM. This work addresses this gap by presenting the implementation and a posteriori validation of a function object library for calculating all terms of the resolved RSTE budget in Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). The library is applied to simulate two canonical wall-bounded turbulent flows: a channel flow and a pipe flow, both at a friction Reynolds number of Re$_{\tau}=180$. The implementation is validated through a mesh refinement study where the results from the LES simulations are systematically compared against high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. The computed budget terms are observed to converge systematically towards the DNS reference data. This validation demonstrates that the implemented library accurately captures the intricate balance of all budget terms. This contribution provides the open-source CFD community with a powerful utility for detailed turbulence analysis, thereby facilitating deeper physical understanding and accelerating the development of next-generation turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Towards extreme event prediction of turbulent flows with quantized local reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops quantized local reduced-order models (ql-ROMs) of the turbulent Minimal Flow Unit (MFU) for the analysis and interpretation of intermittent dissipative dynamics and extreme events. The ql-ROM combines data-driven clustering of the flow state space with intrusive Galerkin projection on locally defined Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) bases. This construction enables an accurate and stable low-dimensional representation of nonlinear flow dynamics whilst preserving the structure of the governing equations. The model is trained on direct numerical simulation data of the MFU. When deployed, the ql-ROM is numerically stable for long-term integration, and correctly infers the statistical behavior of the kinetic energy and dissipation observed of the full-order system. A local modal energy-budget formulation is employed to quantify intermodal energy transfer and viscous dissipation within each region of the attractor. The analysis reveals that dissipation bursts correspond to localized energy transfer from streamwise streaks and travelling-wave modes toward highly dissipative vortical structures, consistent with the self-sustaining process of near-wall turbulence. Beyond reduced modeling, the ql-ROM framework provides a pathway for the reduced-space characterization and potential prediction of extreme events. ql-ROM offer an interpretable and computationally efficient framework for the analysis and prediction of extreme events in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Dissecting coherent motions in extreme wall shear stress events within adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent motions associated with extreme wall shear stress events are investigated for adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers (APG-TBLs). The analyses are performed using wall-resolved large eddy simulations of a NACA0012 airfoil at angles of attack of 9 and 12 deg. and Reynolds number 400000. The suction side exhibits attached TBLs which develop under progressively stronger APGs. A quadrant decomposition of Reynolds shear stress shows that sweeps and ejections dominate the momentum exchange between the mean and fluctuating fields, with the intensity of sweeps near the wall growing more rapidly with APG strength. Probability density functions of wall shear stress reveal a higher frequency of backflow events and an increased distribution symmetry with stronger APGs. Extreme positive and backflow events are examined using space--time correlations and conditional statistics. Conditional averages show that backflow events originate from inner-layer sweep motions bringing high-momentum fluid toward the wall, followed by ejections that drive local deceleration. In such cases, the intensity of ejections is modulated by the APG strength. The dynamics of coherent turbulent structures and their interactions are examined using conditional flow field analyses. For extreme positive events, stronger APGs lead to shorter high-speed streaks, while the associated sweep motions generate spanwise velocities that increasingly influence the near-wall dynamics. In the case of backflows, stronger APGs shorten low-speed streaks and amplify high-speed structures associated with sweep motions, promoting spanwise alignment of vortical structures. Overall, APGs modify the structure and dynamics of extreme near-wall events by reshaping the balance and spatial organization of sweep- and ejection-dominated motions.</description>

      <title>Inference of microporosity phase properties in heterogeneous carbonate rock with data assimilation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate digital rock modeling of carbonate rocks is limited by the difficulty in acquiring morphological information on small-scale pore structures. Defined as microporosity phases in computed tomography (micro-CT) images, these small-scale pore structures may provide crucial connectivity between resolved pores (macroporosity). However, some carbonate rocks are heterogeneous, and high-resolution scans are resource-intensive, impeding comprehensive sampling of microporosity phases. In this context, we propose the usage of the ensemble smoother multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm to infer the multiphase flow properties of microporosity phases from experimental observations for digital rock modeling. The algorithm's effectiveness and compatibility are validated through a case study on a set of mm-scale Estaillades drainage image data. The case study applies ESMDA to two capillary pressure models to infer the multiphase flow properties of microporosity phases. The capillary pressure curve and saturation map were used as observations to predict wetting phase saturation at six capillary pressure steps during iterative data assimilation. The ESMDA algorithm demonstrates improved performance with increasingly comprehensive observation data inputs, achieving better prediction than recently published alternative techniques. Additionally, ESMDA can assess the consistency between various forward physical models and experimental observations, serving as a diagnostic tool for future characterization. Given the diverse application conditions, we propose that ESMDA can be a general method in the characterization workflow of carbonate rocks.</description>

      <title>Bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion Surrogate with Active Learning for Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error, estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression. New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in the freeze-thaw cycle of emulsions and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycles can be regularly observed in nature in water and are essential in industry and science. Objects present in the medium will interact with either an advancing solidification front during freezing or a retracting solidification front, i.e., an advancing melting front, during thawing. It is well known that objects show complex behaviours when interacting with the advancing solidification front, but the extent to which they are displaced during the retraction of the solid-liquid interface is less well understood. To study potential hysteresis effects during freeze-thaw cycles, we exploit experimental model systems of oil-in-water emulsions and polystyrene (PS) particle suspensions, in which a water-ice solidification front advances and retracts over an individual immiscible (and deformable) oil droplet or over a solid PS particle. We record several interesting hysteresis effects, resulting in non-zero relative displacements of the objects between freezing and thawing. PS particles tend to migrate further and further away from their initial position, whereas oil droplets tend to return to their starting positions during thawing. We rationalize our experimental findings by comparing them to our prior theoretical model of Meijer, Bertin &amp; Lohse, Phys. Rev. Fluids (2025), yielding a qualitatively good agreement. Additionally, we look into the reversibility of how the droplet deforms and re-shapes throughout one freeze-thaw cycle, which will turn out to be remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling and Learning-Based Adaptive Control of Solid-Fuel Ramjets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-fuel ramjets offer a compact, energy-dense propulsion option for long-range, high-speed flight but pose significant challenges for thrust regulation due to strong nonlinearities, limited actuation authority, and complex multi-physics coupling between fuel regression, combustion, and compressible flow. This paper presents a computational and control framework that combines a computational fluid dynamics model of an SFRJ with a learning-based adaptive control approach. A CFD model incorporating heat addition was developed to characterize thrust response, establish the operational envelope, and identify the onset of inlet unstart. An adaptive proportional-integral controller, updated online using the retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) algorithm, was then applied to regulate thrust. Closed-loop simulations demonstrate that the RCAC-based controller achieves accurate thrust regulation under both static and dynamic operating conditions, while remaining robust to variations in commands, hyperparameters, and inlet states. The results highlight the suitability of RCAC for SFRJ control, where accurate reduced-order models are challenging to obtain, and underscore the potential of learning-based adaptive control to enable robust and reliable operation of SFRJs in future air-breathing propulsion applications.</description>

      <title>Implementation of integral surface tension formulations in a volume of fluid framework and their applications to Marangoni flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate numerical modeling of surface tension has been a challenging aspect of multiphase flow simulations. The integral formulation for modeling surface tension forces is known to be consistent and conservative, and to be a natural choice for the simulation of flows driven by surface tension gradients along the interface. This formulation was introduced by Popinet and Zaleski [1] for a front-tracking method and was later extended to level set methods by Al-Saud et al. [2]. In this work, we extend the integral formulation to a volume of fluid (VOF) method for capturing the interface. In fact, we propose three different schemes distinguished by the way we calculate the geometric properties of the interface, namely curvature, tangent vector and surface fraction from VOF representation. We propose a coupled level set volume of fluid (CLSVOF) method in which we use a signed distance function coupled with VOF, a height function (HF) method in which we use the height functions calculated from VOF, and a height function to distance (HF2D) method in which we use a sign-distance function calculated from height functions. For validation, these methods are rigorously tested for several problems with constant as well as varying surface tension. It is found that from an accuracy standpoint, CLSVOF has the least numerical oscillations followed by HF2D and then HF. However, from a computational speed point of view, HF method is the fastest followed by HF2D and then CLSVOF. Therefore, the HF2D method is a good compromise between speed and accuracy for obtaining faster and correct results.

      <title>Size Amplification of Jet Drops due to Insoluble Surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface bubbles in the environment or engineering configurations, such as the ocean-atmosphere interface, sparkling wine, or during volcanic eruptions typically live on contaminated surfaces. A particularly common type of contamination is surface active agents (surfactants). We consider the effect of insoluble surfactant on jet drop formation by bubble bursting. Contrary to the observed trend that surfactants decrease the ejected drop radius for bubbles with precursor capillary waves, we find that surfactants increase the ejected drop radius for bubbles without precursor capillary waves - a regime characteristic of small bubbles. Consequently, the results have fundamental implications for understanding aerosol distributions in contaminated conditions. We find that the trend reversal is due to the effect of Marangoni stresses on the focusing of the collapsing cavity. We demonstrate quantitative agreement on the jet velocity and drop size between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations by using the measured surface tension dependence on surfactant concentration as the equation of state for the simulations.

      <title>Upstream motion of oil droplets in co-axial Ouzo flow due to Marangoni forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore the physicochemical hydrodynamics of phase-separating ternary liquids (Ouzo-type), a binary oil-ethanol mixture is introduced into a co-flowing stream of water. Oil droplets nucleate at the interface between the two liquids, leading to a larger oil droplet interacting with the ethanol-rich jet. Although buoyancy forces and hydrodynamic drag forces push the droplet in downstream direction, we observe an upstream motion. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations of a simplified model system, we identify the nucleation zone for oil droplets and uncover Marangoni forces to be responsible for the upstream motion of the droplet. A semi-analytical model allows us to identify the key parameters governing this effect. A general conclusion is that Marangoni stresses can reverse the motion of droplets through channels, where the surrounding liquid is a multi-component mixture. The insights from this work are not only relevant for channel flow, but more generally, for the physicochemical hydrodynamics of multiphase, multi-component systems.</description>
