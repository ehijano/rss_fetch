      <title>Total acyclicity of complexes over group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study group algebras over which modules have a controlled behaviour with respect to the notions of Gorenstein homological algebra, namely: (a) Gorenstein projective modules are Gorenstein flat, (b) any module whose dual is Gorenstein injective is necessarily Gorentein flat, (c) the Gorenstein projective cotorsion pair is complete and (d) any acyclic complex of projective, injective or flat modules is totally acyclic (in the respective sense). We consider a certain class of groups satisfying all of these properties and show that it is closed under the operation LH defined by Kropholler and the operation {\Phi} defined by the second author. We thus generalize all previously known results regarding these properties over group algebras and place these results in an appropriate framework.</description>

      <title>The maximal subgroups of the exceptional groups $F_4(q)$, $E_6(q)$ and ${}^2E_6(q)$ and related almost simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.04869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article produces a complete list of all maximal subgroups of the finite simple groups of type $F_4$, $E_6$, and twisted $E_6$ over all finite fields. Along the way, we determine the collection of Lie primitive almost simple subgroups of the corresponding algebraic groups. We give the stabilizers under the actions of outer automorphisms, from which one can obtain complete information about the maximal subgroups of all almost simple groups with socle one of these groups. We also provide a new maximal subgroup of ${}^2\!F_4(8)$, correcting the maximal subgroups for that group from the list of Malle. This provides the first new exceptional groups of Lie type to have their maximal subgroups enumerated for three decades. The techniques are a mixture of algebraic groups, representation theory, computational algebra, and use of the trilinear form on the 27-dimensional minimal module for $E_6$. We provide a collection of auxiliary Magma files that prove the author's computational claims, yielding existence and the number of conjugacy classes of all maximal subgroups mentioned in the text.</description>

      <title>On profinite rigidity amongst free-by-cyclic groups I: the generic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that amongst the class of free-by-cyclic groups, Gromov hyperbolicity is an invariant of the profinite completion. We show that whenever $G$ is a free-by-cyclic group with first Betti number equal to one, and $H$ is a free-by-cyclic group which is profinitely isomorphic to $G$, the ranks of the fibres and the characteristic polynomials associated to the monodromies of $G$ and $H$ are equal. We further show that for hyperbolic free-by-cyclic groups with first Betti number equal to one, the stretch factors of the associated monodromy and its inverse is an invariant of the profinite completion. We deduce that irreducible free-by-cyclic groups with first Betti number equal to one are almost profinitely rigid amongst irreducible free-by-cyclic groups. We use this to prove that generic free-by-cyclic groups are almost profinitely rigid amongst free-by-cyclic groups. We also show a similar results for {universal Coxeter}-by-cyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Quasi-retracts of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subgroup $H\le G$ is a quasi-retract of $G$ if there exists a quasi-homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ which restricts to the identity on $H$. In this paper, we study under what conditions a subgroup is a quasi-retract of the whole group. We also show that a subgroup of $F_2$ is a nontrivial quasi-retract if and only if it is cyclic. As an intermediate result, we show that for any short exact sequence of groups $1\to H\to G\to G/H\to 1$, the following are equivalent: (i) it is left quasi-split (or equivalently, $H$ is a quasi-retract of $G$). (ii) it is right quasi-split and $H$ almost commutes with a right coset transversal of $H$ in $G$. (iii) $G$ is strictly quasi-isomorphic to $H\times G/H$. This is an analogue to the classical result on split short exact sequence of groups.</description>

      <title>Translation length formula for two-generated groups acting on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate translation length functions for two-generated groups acting by isometries on $\Lambda$-trees, where $\Lambda$ is a totally ordered Abelian group. In this context, we provide an explicit formula for the translation length of any element of the group, under some assumptions on the translation lengths of its generators and their products. Our approach is combinatorial and relies solely on the defining axioms of pseudo-lengths, which are precisely the translation length functions for actions on $\Lambda$-trees. Furthermore, we show that, under some natural conditions on four elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \Lambda$, there exists a unique pseudo-length on the free group $F(a,b)$ assigning these values to $a$, $b$, $ab$, $ab^{-1}$, respectively.
  Applications include results on properly discontinuous actions, discrete and free groups of isometries, and a description of the translation length functions arising from free actions on $\Lambda$-trees, where $\Lambda$ is Archimedean. This description is related to the Culler--Vogtmann outer space.</description>

      <title>Group class operations and homological conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kropholler's operation ${\scriptstyle{{\bf LH}}}$ and Talelli's operation $\Phi$ can be often used to formally enlarge the class of available examples of groups that satisfy certain homological conditions. In this paper, we employ this enlargement technique regarding two specific homological conditions. We thereby demonstrate the abundance of groups that (a) have virtually Gorenstein group algebras, as defined by Beligiannis and Reiten, and (b) satisfy Moore's conjecture on the relation between projectivity and relative projectivity, that was studied by Chouinard, Aljadeff, Cornick, Ginosar, Kropholler and Meir.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$-convex cocompactness and higher higher Teichm\"uller spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any integers $p\geq 2$ and $q\geq 1$, let $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$ be the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space of signature $(p,q)$. We prove that if $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $p$-manifold, then the set of representations of $\Gamma$ to $\mathrm{PO}(p,q+1)$ which are convex cocompact in $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$ is a union of connected components of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,\mathrm{PO}(p,q+1))$. This gives new examples of higher-dimensional higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02617v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a semigroup of matrices has a submultiplicative spectrum if the spectrum of the product of any two elements of the semigroup is contained in the product of the two spectra in question (as sets). In this note we explore an approximate version of this condition.</description>
