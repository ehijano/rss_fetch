      <title>Lagrangian Drifter Path Identification and Prediction: SINDy vs Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the performance of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in identification of the underlying mechanisms of open ocean Lagrangian drifter hydrodynamics with possible applications in coastal and port hydrodynamic processes. With this motivation we employ two different Lagrangian drifter datasets acquired by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s surface buoys with proper World Meteorological Organization (WMO) numbers. In the SINDy approach, the primary goal is to identify the drifter paths of buoys using ordinary differential equation sets with a minimal number of sparse coefficients. In the neural ODE approach, the goal is to identify the derivative of the hidden state of a neural network (NN). Using the acquired data, we examine the applicability of the SINDy and the neural ODE algorithms in identification of the drifter trajectories comparatively. We propose that while both of the algorithms may give acceptable results for open ocean, the SINDy-based algorithmic approach can predict the Lagrangian drifter paths more accurately and consistently at least for the datasets investigated and parameters selected. A discussion of our findings with potential applications in search and rescue missions in the open ocean, their limitations and applicability are also presented.</description>

      <title>Role of Autoconversion Parameterization in Coupled Climate Model for Simulating Monsoon Subseasonal Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and associated monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISOs) influence the billions of people living in the Indian subcontinent. This study explores the role of autoconversion parameterization in microphysical schemes for the simulation of MISO with the coupled climate model, e.g., the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2), by conducting sensitivity experiments in two resolutions (~100 km and ~38 km). Results reveal that the modified autoconversion parameterization better simulates the active-break spells of the ISM rainfall. The main improvements include the contrasting features of rainfall over land and ocean and the MISO index, representing MISO periodicity. The improvements are qualitatively and quantitatively more significant in the higher-resolution simulations, particularly regarding rainfall spatial patterns over the Indian subcontinent during active spells. The MISO monitoring index in the revised CFSv2 also shows improvement compared to the control run. This study concludes that proper autoconversion parameterization in the coupled climate model can lead to enhanced representation of active/break spells and sub-seasonal variability of ISM.</description>

      <title>Distributions and correlation properties of offshore wind speeds and wind speed increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine distributions and correlation properties of offshore wind speeds and wind speed increments by analyzing wind data sampled with a resolution of one second for 20 months at different heights above sea level in the North Sea. Distributions of horizontal wind speeds can be fitted to Weibull distributions with shape and scale parameters varying weakly with the vertical height separation. Kullback-Leibler divergences between distributions at different heights change with the squared logarithm of the height ratio. Cross-correlations between time derivatives of wind speeds are long-term anticorrelated, and the even parts of their correlation functions satisfy sum rules. Distributions of horizontal wind speed increments change from a tent-like shape to a Gaussian with rising increment lag. A surprising peak occurs in the left tail of the increment distributions for lags in a range $10-200\,{\rm km}$ after applying the Taylor's hypothesis locally to transform time lags into distances. The peak is decisive in order to obtain an expected and observed linear scaling of third-order structure functions with distance. This suggests that it is an intrinsic feature of atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Based Quantification of Contrail Radiative Forcing over Europe: A Two-Week Analysis of Aviation-Induced Climate Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aviation's non-CO$_2$ effects, especially the impact of aviation-induced contrails, drive atmospheric changes and can influence climate dynamics. Although contrails are believed to contribute to global warming through their net warming effect, uncertainties persist due to the challenges in accurately measuring their radiative impacts. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between aviation-induced contrails, as observed in Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite imagery, and their impact on radiative forcing (RF) over a two-week study. Results show that while daytime contrails generally have a cooling effect, the higher number of nighttime contrails results in a net warming effect over the entire day. Net RF values for detected contrails range approximately from -8 TW to 2.5 TW during the day and from 0 to 6 TW at night. Our findings also show a 41.03% increase in contrail coverage from January 24-30, 2023, to the same week in 2024, accompanied by a 128.7% rise in contrail radiative forcing (CRF), indicating greater warming from the added contrails. These findings highlight the necessity of considering temporal factors, such as the timing and duration of contrail formation, when assessing their overall warming impact. They also indicate a potential increase in contrail-induced warming from 2023 to 2024, attributable to the rise in contrail coverage. Further investigation into these trends is crucial for the development of effective mitigation strategies.</description>
