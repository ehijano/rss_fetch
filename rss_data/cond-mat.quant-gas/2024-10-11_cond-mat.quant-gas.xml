      <title>Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics in the Fractional Quantum Hall Regime of Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively. The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knots that Never Come Untied</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Bose-Fermi mixture in a strongly correlated moir\'e bilayer electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gases consisting of species with distinct quantum statistics, such as Bose-Fermi mixtures, can behave in a fundamentally different way than their unmixed constituents. This makes them an essential platform for studying emergent quantum many-body phenomena such as mediated interactions and unconventional pairing. Here, we realize an equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixture in a bilayer electron system implemented in a WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ moir\'e heterobilayer with strong Coulomb coupling to a nearby moir\'e-free WSe$_{2}$ monolayer. Absent the fermionic component, the underlying bosonic phase manifests as a dipolar excitonic insulator. By injecting excess charges into it, we show that the bosonic phase forms a stable mixture with added electrons but abruptly collapses upon hole doping. We develop a microscopic model to explain the unusual asymmetric stability with respect to electron and hole doping. By studying the Bose-Fermi mixture via monitoring excitonic resonances from both layers, we demonstrate gate-tunability over a wide range in the boson/fermion density phase space, in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations. Our results further the understanding of phases stabilized in moir\'e bilayer electron systems and demonstrate their potential for exploring the exotic properties of equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <title>Exact diagonalization using hierarchical wave functions and calculation of topological entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new technique for numerical exact diagonalization. The method is particularly suitable for cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, in which multiple atoms can occupy a lattice site. We describe the use of the method for Bose-Hubbard model of a two-dimensional square lattice system as an example; however, the method is general and can be applied to other lattice models and can be adapted to three-dimensional systems. The proposed numerical technique focuses in detail on how to construct the basis states as a hierarchy of wave functions. Starting from single-site Fock states, we construct the basis set in terms of row states and multirow states. This simplifies the application of constraints and calculation of the Hamiltonian matrix. The approach simplifies the calculation of the reduced density matrices, and this has applications in characterizing the topological entanglement of the state. Each step of the method can be parallelized to accelerate the computation. As a case study, we discuss the computation of the spatial bipartite entanglement entropy in the correlated $\nu = 1/2$ fractional quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Robust Finite-Temperature Many-Body Scarring on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms for suppressing thermalization in disorder-free many-body systems, such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest in foundations of quantum statistical physics and potential quantum information processing applications. However, their sensitivity to realistic effects such as finite temperature remains largely unexplored. Here, we have utilized IBM's Kolkata quantum processor to demonstrate an unexpected robustness of quantum many-body scars at finite temperatures when the system is prepared in a thermal Gibbs ensemble. We identify such robustness in the PXP model, which describes quantum many-body scars in experimental systems of Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold atoms in tilted Bose--Hubbard optical lattices. By contrast, other theoretical models which host exact quantum many-body scars are found to lack such robustness, and their scarring properties quickly decay with temperature. Our study sheds light on the important differences between scarred models in terms of their algebraic structures, which impacts their resilience to finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping and trapping of two-component gap solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Thouless pumping and arresting of gap solitons in a two-component Bose gas loaded into an optical superlattice. We show that, depending on the atomic interactions and chemical potentials, the two solitons can be simultaneously pumped or trapped, but we also identify regimes where one soliton is pumped and the other arrested. These behaviors can be understood by considering an effective model of the system based on a variational approach, which reveals that the soliton width is a suitable qualifier for the observed behaviours: solitons with a larger width get transported, while solitons with a smaller width get trapped. Since these width can be controlled by tuning interactions, it should be possible to observe all behaviours experimentally.</description>

      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective field theory to nonuniversal equation of state of an ultracold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) serves as a cornerstone in elucidating the properties of quantum many-body systems. A recent highlight along this research line consists of the derivation of the nonuniversal Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) EOS for an ultracold quantum bosonic gas with finite-range interatomic interactions using one-loop effective path-integral field theory. The purpose of this work is to extend Salasnich's pioneering work to uncover beyond-LHY corrections to the EOS by employing the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective field theory, leveraging its two-loop approximation. In this end, we expand Salasnich's remarkable findings of EOS to the next leading order characterized by $\left(\rho a_{\text{s}}^{3}\right)^{2}$, with $\rho$ and $a_{\text{s}}$ being the density and the $s$-wave scattering length. Notably, we derive analytical expressions for quantum depletion and chemical potential, representing the next-to-LHY corrections to nonuniversal EOS induced by finite-range effects. Moreover, we propose an experimental protocol of observing the nonuniversal next-to-LHY corrections to the EOS by calculating fractional frequency shifts in the breathing modes. The nonuniversal beyond-LHY EOS in this work paves the way of using LHY effects in quantum simulation experiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime.</description>

Abstract: We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>
