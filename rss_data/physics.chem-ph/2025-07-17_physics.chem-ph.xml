      <title>An ultra-slow optical centrifuge. I. Zero rotational acceleration by spectral focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.</description>

      <title>Accelerated free energy estimation in ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for accelerating the estimation of the free energy from path integral Monte Carlo simulations by considering an intermediate artificial reference system where interactions are inexpensive to evaluate numerically. Using the spherically averaged Ewald interaction as this intermediate reference system for the uniform electron gas, the interaction contribution for the free energy was evaluated up to 18 times faster than the Ewald-only method. Furthermore, a $\xi$-extrapolation technique was tested and applied to alleviate the fermion sign problem and to resolve the sign for large particle numbers. Combining these two techniques enabled the evaluation of the free energy for a system of 1000 electrons, where both finite-size and statistical errors are below chemical accuracy. The general procedure can be applied to systems relevant for planetary and inertial confinement fusion modeling with low to moderate levels of quantum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>$GW$+2SOSEX self-energy made positive semi-definite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of vertex corrections beyond the $GW$ approximation within the framework of perturbation theory is a subtle and challenging task, which accounts for the wide variety of schemes proposed over the years. Exact self-energies are required to satisfy the mathematical condition of positive semi-definiteness. The $GW$ self-energy fulfills this property, but the vast majority of the vertex-corrected self-energy approximations do not. In this study, we devise a positive semi-definite extension to the $GW$+2SOSEX self-energy that we name $GW$+2SOSEX-psd. To reach this goal, we demonstrate the cancellation of the bare energy poles that are contained in the fully dynamic second-order in $W$ self-energy ($G3W2$). We then demonstrate on molecular examples the correct positive semi-definiteness of the proposed self-energy approximation and its good accuracy in predicting accurate quasiparticle energies for valence and core states.</description>

      <title>Sridhara-Compressed VQE Accelerates Molecular Energy Ranking of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of $(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Feshbach resonances in Ba$^+$+Li collisions due to strong spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a pronounced dependence of magnetic Feshbach resonance spectra on the initial hyperfine-Zeeman state of Li in ultracold $^{138}$Ba$^+$+$^6$Li collisions. The measured number and distribution of resonances differ significantly between the two lowest states despite their similar electron spin character. We address this puzzle by developing a comprehensive yet generic computational model calibrated against key statistical features in the experimental spectrum. We confirm that strong spin-orbit coupling induces essential changes in the distribution of resonances, leading to an increase in the number of resolvable resonances. Our model reproduces the statistics of the spectrum with the lowest Li state but struggles with the second-lowest state, where a significantly smaller number of resonances is experimentally observed.</description>

      <title>Trapping absorbing and non-absorbing aqueous particle using a universal 4-arm Laguerre-Gaussian mode light trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing secondary organic aerosols (SOA), has attracted broad interest due to their importance for climate and human health. The pronounced time-dependence of light absorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on global warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be very useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through processes such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps cannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly absorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can isolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment of the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However, mechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and observation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does not require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four trapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian beams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The performance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of absorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used to observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic acid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate that the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams. The study also shows that spectroscopy measurements, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, are possible in all configurations of the proposed trap.</description>

Abstract: Polariton chemistry has emerged as a new approach to directing molecular systems via strong light-matter interactions in confined photonic media. In this work, we implement a classical electrodynamics-molecular dynamics method to investigate collision-induced emission and radiative association in planar microcavities under variable light-matter coupling strength. We focus on the argon-xenon (Ar-Xe) gas mixture as a representative system, simulating collisions coupled to the confined multimode electromagnetic field. We find that while the effects of a microcavity on collision-induced emission spectra are subtle, even at extremely large coupling strengths, radiative association can be significantly enhanced in a microcavity. Our results also indicate that microcavities may be designed to induce changes in the statistical distribution of Ar-Xe complex lifetimes. These findings provide new insights into the control of intermolecular interactions and radiative kinetics with microcavities.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Entanglement in Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Polariton Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons are hybrid light-matter states that enable the exploration of potential cavity-modified chemistry. The development of dynamical, first-principles approaches for simulating molecular polaritons is important for understanding their origins and properties. Herein, we present a hierarchy of first-principles methods to simulate the real-time dynamics of molecular polaritons in the strong coupling regime. These methods are based on real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) and the corresponding real-time nuclear-electronic orbital (RT-NEO) approach, in which specified nuclei are treated quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons. The hierarchy spans semiclassical, mean-field-quantum, and full-quantum approaches to simulate polariton dynamics under both electronic strong coupling and vibrational strong coupling. In the semiclassical approaches, the cavity mode is treated classically, whereas in the full-quantum approaches, the cavity mode is treated quantum mechanically with propagation of a joint molecule-mode density matrix. The semiclassical and full-quantum approaches produce virtually identical Rabi splittings and polariton peak locations for the systems studied. However, the full-quantum approaches allow exploration of molecule-mode quantum entanglement in the real-time dynamics. Although the degree of light-matter entanglement is relatively small in the systems considered, the oscillations of the von Neumann entropy reveal an entanglement Rabi splitting that differs from the Rabi splitting computed from the time-dependent dipole moment. These results suggest that a classical treatment of the cavity mode may provide an excellent description of polariton dynamics for macroscopic observables such as the Rabi splitting, but novel physics may be detectable by considering molecule-mode entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the modification of the spontaneous decay rate in the presence of electromagnetic media and bodies. In this work, we shed light on the dependencies and magnitude of this effect for chiral materials. Using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and Fermi's golden rule, we study a chiral bulk medium with and without local-field corrections, an idealised chiral mirror and a chiral surface. The results imply that the chiral effect is greatest for large transition frequencies, molecules with large optical rotatory strength and media with a strong cross-susceptibility. In the case of a half space, short distances from the molecule to the interface additionally enhance the effect.</description>

      <title>Practical techniques for high-precision measurements on near-term quantum hardware and applications in molecular energy estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-precision measurements on near-term quantum devices is critical for advancing quantum computing applications. Quantum computers suffer from high readout errors, making quantum simulations with high accuracy requirements particularly challenging. This paper implements practical techniques to reach accuracies essential for quantum chemistry by addressing key overheads and noise sources. Specifically, we leverage locally biased random measurements for reducing shot overhead, repeated settings with parallel quantum detector tomography for reducing circuit overhead and mitigating readout errors, and blended scheduling for mitigating time-dependent noise. We demonstrate these techniques via molecular energy estimation of the BODIPY molecule on a Hartree-Fock state on an IBM Eagle r3, obtaining a reduction in measurement errors by an order of magnitude from 1-5% to 0.16%. These strategies pave the way for more reliable quantum computations, particularly for applications requiring precise molecular energy calculations.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED), in which the diffusion coefficient of an enzyme transiently increases during catalysis, has been extensively reported experimentally. We numerically and analytically demonstrate that such enzymes can act as Maxwell's demons. They use their enhanced diffusion as a memory of the previous catalytic reaction, to gain information and drive steady-state chemical concentrations away from chemical equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for this process, highlighting the functional role of EED and its relevance to cellular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance accuracy of a model over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</description>

Abstract: Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>

Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>
