      <title>Sparse Random Matrices for Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) theorem states that a set of points in high-dimensional space can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space while approximately preserving pairwise distances with high probability Johnson and Lindenstrauss (1984). The standard JL theorem uses dense random matrices with Gaussian entries. However, for some applications, sparse random matrices are preferred as they allow for faster matrix-vector multiplication. I outline the constructions and proofs introduced by Achlioptas (2003) and the contemporary standard by Kane and Nelson (2014). Further, I implement and empirically compare these sparse constructions with standard Gaussian JL matrices.</description>

      <title>Kidney Exchange: Faster Parameterized Algorithms and Tighter Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kidney exchange mechanism allows many patient-donor pairs who are otherwise incompatible with each other to come together and exchange kidneys along a cycle. However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.
  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\star\left(14^t\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\star\left((4e)^t\right)\approx O^\star\left(10.88^t\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Global Minimum Vertex-Cut in Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the directed global minimum vertex-cut problem: given a directed vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a vertex-cut $(L,S,R)$ in $G$ of minimum value, which is defined to be the total weight of all vertices in $S$. The problem, together with its edge-based variant, is one of the most basic in graph theory and algorithms, and has been studied extensively. The fastest currently known algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) has running time $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. A long line of work over the past decades led to faster algorithms for other main versions of the problem, including the undirected edge-based setting (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), directed edge-based setting (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), and undirected vertex-based setting (Chuzhoy and Trabelsi, STOC 2025). However, for the vertex-based version in directed graphs, the 29 year-old $\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm of Henzinger, Rao and Gabow remains the state of the art to this day, in all edge-density regimes. In this paper we break the $\Theta(mn)$ running time barrier for the first time, by providing a randomized algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut, with running time $O\left(mn^{0.976}\cdot\operatorname{polylog} W\right)$ where $W$ is the ratio of largest to smallest vertex weight. Additionally, we provide a randomized $O\left(\min\left\{m^{1+o(1)}\cdot k,n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$-time algorithm for the unweighted version of directed global minimum vertex-cut, where $k$ is the value of the optimal solution. The best previous algorithm for the problem achieved running time $\tilde O\left(\min\left\{k^2 \cdot m, mn^{11/12+o(1)}, n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$ (Forster et al., SODA 2020, Li et al., STOC 2021).</description>

      <title>Fair Committee Selection under Ordinal Preferences and Limited Cardinal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.
  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries.</description>

      <title>Approximations for the Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance Problem with Intergenic Region Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement distances are an established method in genome comparison. Works in this area may include various rearrangement operations representing large-scale mutations, gene orientation information, the number of nucleotides in intergenic regions, and weights reflecting the expected frequency of each operation. In this article, we model genomes containing at most one copy of each gene by considering gene sequences, with orientations, and representing intergenic regions according to their nucleotide lengths. We looked at a problem called Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance, which seeks the minimal cost sequence composed by the rearrangement operations of reversals, transposition, and indels, capable of transforming one genome into another. We leverage a structure called Labeled Intergenic Breakpoint Graph to show an algorithm for that problem with guaranteed approximations considering some sets of weights for the operations.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Fair Repetitive Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced fair repetitive scheduling problem involving a set of clients, each asking for their associated job to be daily scheduled on a single machine across a finite planning horizon. The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases.
  In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows:
  (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days.
  (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}+\epsilon)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days.
  The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>EF(X) Orientations: A Parameterized Complexity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of fair orientations in graphs was introduced by Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa in 2023, naturally modeling fair division scenarios in which resources are only contested by neighbors. In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.</description>

      <title>On Circular Threshold Words and Other Stronger Versions of Dejean's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let the root of the word $w$ be the smallest prefix $v$ of $w$ such that $w$ is a prefix of $vvv...$. $per(w)$ is the length of the root of $w$. For any $n\ge5$, an $n$-ary threshold word is a word $w$ such that for any factor (subword) $v$ of $w$ the condition $\frac{|v|}{per(v)}\le\frac{n}{n-1}$ holds. Dejean conjecture (completely proven in 2009) states for $n\ge5$ that exists infinitely many of $n$-ary TWs.
  This manuscript is based on the author's student works (diplomas of 2011 (bachelor's thesis) and 2013 (master's thesis) years) and presents an edited version (in Russian) of these works with some improvements.
  In a 2011 work proposed new methods of proving of the Dejean conjecture for some odd cases $n\ge5$, using computer verification in polynomial time (depending on $n$). Moreover, the constructed threshold words (TWs) are ciclic/ring TWs (any cyclic shift is a TW).
  In the 2013 work, the proof method (of 2011) was improved by reducing the verification conditions. A solution for some even cases $n\ge6$ is also proposed. A 2013 work also proposed a method to construct stronger TWs, using a TW tree with regular exponential growth. Namely, the TWs, where all long factors have an exponent close to 1.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Framework for Online Stochastic Matching with Correlated Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02229v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of online algorithms for matching markets and revenue management settings is usually bound by the assumption that the demand process is formed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn independently. This notion of serial independence implies that the demand of each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and is approximately Poisson-distributed.
  This paper proposes a nonparametric framework for modeling arrival sequences in online stochastic matching that departs from the serial independent assumption. We propose two models, INDEP and CORREL, that capture different forms of serial correlations by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with standard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random order. The INDEP model can capture arbitrary serial correlations within each customer type but assumes cross-sectional independence across types, whereas the CORREL model captures common shocks across customer types. We demonstrate that fluid relaxations, which rely solely on demand expectations, have arbitrarily bad performance guarantees. In contrast, we develop new algorithms that achieve optimal (constant-factor) performance guarantees in each model. Our mathematical analysis includes tighter linear programming (LP) relaxations that leverage distribution knowledge, and a new lossless randomized LP rounding scheme for INDEP. We test our new LP relaxations and rounding scheme in simulations on real and synthetic data, and find that they consistently outperform well-established matching algorithms, especially on real data sequences that exhibit greater demand variance.</description>

      <title>Maximum Independent Set when excluding an induced minor: $K_1 + tK_2$ and $tC_3 \uplus C_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel [arXiv '22] ask if for every class excluding a fixed planar graph $H$ as an induced minor, Maximum Independent Set can be solved in polynomial time, and show that this is indeed the case when $H$ is any planar complete bipartite graph, or the 5-vertex clique minus one edge, or minus two disjoint edges. A positive answer would constitute a far-reaching generalization of the state-of-the-art, when we currently do not know if a polynomial-time algorithm exists when $H$ is the 7-vertex path. Relaxing tractability to the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm, we know substantially more. Indeed, quasipolynomial-time algorithms were recently obtained for the $t$-vertex cycle, $C_t$ [Gartland et al., STOC '21] and the disjoint union of $t$ triangles, $tC_3$ [Bonamy et al., SODA '23].
  We give, for every integer $t$, a polynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^5)}$ when $H$ is the friendship graph $K_1 + tK_2$ ($t$ disjoint edges plus a vertex fully adjacent to them), and a quasipolynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^2 \log n)+f(t)}$, with $f$ a single-exponential function, when $H$ is $tC_3 \uplus C_4$ (the disjoint union of $t$ triangles and a 4-vertex cycle). The former extends a classical result on graphs excluding $tK_2$ as an induced subgraph [Alekseev, DAM '07], while the latter extends Bonamy et al.'s result.</description>

      <title>Subsequence Matching and LCS under Cartesian-Tree Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two strings of the same length are said to Cartesian-tree match (CT-match) if their Cartesian-trees are isomorphic [Park et al., TCS 2020]. Cartesian-tree matching is a natural model that allows for capturing similarities of numerical sequences. Oizumi et al. [CPM 2022] showed that subsequence pattern matching under CT-matching model (CT-MSeq) can be solved in $O(nm \log \log n)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are text and pattern lengths, respectively. This current article follows this line of research, and gives the following new results: (1) An $O(nm)$-time CT-MSeq algorithm for binary alphabets; (2) An $O((nm)^{1-\epsilon})$-time conditional lower bound for the CT-MSeq problem on alphabets of size 4, for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, under the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis (OVH). Further, we introduce the new problem of longest common subsequence under CT-matching (CT-LCS) for two given strings $S$ and $T$ of length $n$, and present the following results: (3) An $O(n^6)$-time CT-LCS algorithm for general ordered alphabets; (4) An $O(n^2 / \log n)$-time CT-LCS algorithm for binary alphabets; (5) An $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$-time conditional lower bound for the CT-LCS problem on alphabets of size 5, for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, under OVH.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Solutions Parameterized by Cliquewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a few solutions for a given problem that are diverse, as opposed to finding a single best solution to solve the problem, has recently become a notable topic in theoretical computer science. Recently, Baste, Fellows, Jaffke, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Oliveira, Philip, and Rosamond showed that under a standard structural parameterization by treewidth, one can find a set of diverse solutions for many problems with only a very small additional cost [Artificial Intelligence 2022]. In this paper, we investigate a much stronger graph parameter, the cliquewidth, which can additionally describe some dense graph classes. Broadly speaking, it describes graphs that can be recursively constructed by a few operations defined on graphs whose vertices are divided into a bounded number of groups while each such group behaves uniformly with respect to any operation.
  We show that for any vertex problem, if we are given a dynamic program solving that problem on cliquewidth decomposition, we can modify it to produce a few solutions that are as diverse as possible with as little overhead as in the above-mentioned treewidth paper. As a consequence, we prove that a diverse version of any MSO$_1$ expressible problem can be solved in linear FPT time parameterized by the cliquewidth, the number of sought solutions, and the number of quantifiers in the formula, which was a natural missing piece in the complexity landscape of structural graph parameters and logic for the diverse problems. We prove our results allowing for a more general natural collection of diversity functions compared to only two mostly studied diversity functions previously. That might be of independent interest as a larger pool of different diversity functions can highlight various aspects of different solutions to a problem.</description>

      <title>Faster and Simpler Online Computation of String Net Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An occurrence of a repeated substring $u$ in a string $S$ is called a net occurrence if extending the occurrence to the left or to the right decreases the number of occurrences to 1. The net frequency (NF) of a repeated substring $u$ in a string $S$ is the number of net occurrences of $u$ in $S$. Very recently, Guo et al. [SPIRE 2024] proposed an online $O(n \log \sigma)$-time algorithm that maintains a data structure of $O(n)$ space which answers Single-NF queries in $O(m\log \sigma + \sigma^2)$ time and reports all answers of the All-NF problem in $O(n\sigma^2)$ time. Here, $n$ is the length of the input string $S$, $m$ is the query pattern length, and $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. The $\sigma^2$ term is a major drawback of their method since computing string net frequencies is originally motivated for Chinese language processing where $\sigma$ can be thousands large. This paper presents an improved online $O(n \log \sigma)$-time algorithm, which answers Single-NF queries in $O(m \log \sigma)$ time and reports all answers to the All-NF problem in output-optimal $O(|\mathsf{NF}^+(S)|)$ time, where $\mathsf{NF}^+(S)$ is the set of substrings of $S$ paired with their positive NF values. We note that $|\mathsf{NF}^+(S)| = O(n)$ always holds. In contract to Guo et al.'s algorithm that is based on Ukkonen's suffix tree construction, our algorithm is based on Weiner's suffix tree construction.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</description>

      <title>Circle graphs can be recognized in linear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, the best circle graph recognition algorithm runs in almost linear time as it relies on a split decomposition algorithm that uses the union-find data-structure. We show that in the case of circle graphs, the PC-tree data-structure allows one to avoid the union-find data-structure to compute the split decomposition in linear time. As a consequence, we obtain the first linear-time recognition algorithm for circle graphs.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Distance Sensitivity Oracles and other Graph Problems on the PRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) problem asks us to preprocess a given graph $G=(V,E)$ in order to answer queries of the form $d(x,y,e)$, which denotes the shortest path distance in $G$ from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ when edge $e$ is removed. This is an important problem for network communication, and it has been extensively studied in the sequential settingand recently in the distributed CONGEST model. However, no prior DSO results tailored to the parallel setting were known.
  We present the first PRAM algorithms to construct DSOs in directed weighted graphs, that can answer a query in $O(1)$ time with a single processor after preprocessing. We also present the first work-optimal PRAM algorithms for other graph problems that belong to the sequential $\tilde{O}(mn)$ fine-grained complexity class: Replacement Paths, Second Simple Shortest Path, All Pairs Second Simple Shortest Paths and Minimum Weight Cycle.</description>

      <title>The Simultaneous Triple Product Property and Group-theoretic Results for the Exponent of Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703145</link>
      <description>arXiv:cs/0703145v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   We describe certain special consequences of certain elementary methods from group theory for studying the algebraic complexity of matrix multiplication, as developed by H. Cohn, C. Umans et. al. in 2003 and 2005. The measure of complexity here is the exponent of matrix multiplication, a real parameter between 2 and 3, which has been conjectured to be 2. More specifically, a finite group may simultaneously "realize" several independent matrix multiplications via its regular algebra if it has a family of triples of "index" subsets which satisfy the so-called simultaneous triple product property (STPP), in which case the complexity of these several multiplications does not exceed the rank (complexity) of the algebra. This leads to bounds for the exponent in terms of the size of the group and the sizes of its STPP triples, as well as the dimensions of its distinct irreducible representations. Wreath products of Abelian with symmetric groups appear especially important, in this regard, and we give an example of such a group which shows that the exponent is less than 2.84, and could be possibly be as small as 2.02 depending on the number of simultaneous matrix multiplications it realizes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Approximation -- Smoothness Tradeoffs for Soft-Max Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft-max function has two main efficiency measures: (1) approximation - which corresponds to how well it approximates the maximum function, (2) smoothness - which shows how sensitive it is to changes of its input. Our goal is to identify the optimal approximation-smoothness tradeoffs for different measures of approximation and smoothness. This leads to novel soft-max functions, each of which is optimal for a different application. The most commonly used soft-max function, called exponential mechanism, has optimal tradeoff between approximation measured in terms of expected additive approximation and smoothness measured with respect to R\'enyi Divergence. We introduce a soft-max function, called "piecewise linear soft-max", with optimal tradeoff between approximation, measured in terms of worst-case additive approximation and smoothness, measured with respect to $\ell_q$-norm. The worst-case approximation guarantee of the piecewise linear mechanism enforces sparsity in the output of our soft-max function, a property that is known to be important in Machine Learning applications [Martins et al. '16, Laha et al. '18] and is not satisfied by the exponential mechanism. Moreover, the $\ell_q$-smoothness is suitable for applications in Mechanism Design and Game Theory where the piecewise linear mechanism outperforms the exponential mechanism. Finally, we investigate another soft-max function, called power mechanism, with optimal tradeoff between expected \textit{multiplicative} approximation and smoothness with respect to the R\'enyi Divergence, which provides improved theoretical and practical results in differentially private submodular optimization.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and updates for conjunctive linear algebra queries through expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the importance of linear algebra and matrix operations in data analytics, there is significant interest in using relational query optimization and processing techniques for evaluating (sparse) linear algebra programs. In particular, in recent years close connections have been established between linear algebra programs and relational algebra that allow transferring optimization techniques of the latter to the former. In this paper, we ask ourselves which linear algebra programs in MATLANG correspond to the free-connex and q-hierarchical fragments of conjunctive first-order logic. Both fragments have desirable query processing properties: free-connex conjunctive queries support constant-delay enumeration after a linear-time preprocessing phase, and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries further allow constant-time updates. By characterizing the corresponding fragments of MATLANG, we hence identify the fragments of linear algebra programs that one can evaluate with constant-delay enumeration after linear-time preprocessing and with constant-time updates. To derive our results, we improve and generalize previous correspondences between MATLANG and relational algebra evaluated over semiring-annotated relations. In addition, we identify properties on semirings that allow to generalize the complexity bounds for free-connex and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries from Boolean annotations to general semirings.</description>

      <title>Strong Linearizability without Compare&amp;Swap: The Case of Bags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because strongly-linearizable objects provide stronger guarantees than linearizability, they serve as valuable building blocks for the design of concurrent data structures. Yet, many objects that have linearizable implementations from base objects weaker than compare&amp;swap objects do not have strongly-linearizable implementations from the same base objects. We focus on one such object: the bag, a multiset from which processes can take unspecified elements.
  We present the first lock-free, strongly-linearizable implementation of a bag from interfering objects (specifically, registers, and test&amp;set objects). This may be surprising, since there are provably no such implementations of stacks or queues.
  Since a bag can contain arbitrarily many elements, an unbounded amount of space must be used to implement it. Hence, it makes sense to also consider a bag with a bound on its capacity. However, like stacks and queues, a bag with capacity $b$ shared by more than $2b$ processes has no lock-free, strongly-linearizable implementation from interfering objects. If we further restrict a bounded bag so that only one process can insert into it, we are able to obtain a lock-free, strongly-linearizable implementation from $O(b + n)$ interfering objects, where $n$ is the number of processes.
  Our goal is to understand the circumstances under which strongly-linearizable implementations of bags exist and, more generally, to understand the power of interfering objects.</description>

      <title>Distributed Graph Algorithms with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of deterministic distributed graph algorithms with predictions in synchronous message passing systems. The process at each node in the graph is given a prediction, which is some extra information about the problem instance that may be incorrect. The processes may use the predictions to help them solve the problem. The overall goal is to develop algorithms that both work faster when predictions are good and do not work much worse than algorithms without predictions when predictions are bad. Concepts from the more general area of algorithms with predictions, such as error measures, consistency, robustness, and smoothness, are adapted to distributed graph algorithms with predictions.
  We consider algorithms with predictions for distributed graph problems, where each node is given a prediction for its output. We present a framework for evaluating distributed graph algorithms with predictions and methods for transforming existing algorithms without predictions to effectively use predictions. Our approach is illustrated by developing algorithms with predictions for the Maximal Independent Set problem.
  We also include a discussion of error measures and demonstrate how fine-tuning an error measure towards a particular problem can yield stronger results about the performance of algorithms for that problem.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Approximate Maximum Matching in the Distributed Vertex Partition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of approximate maximum matching in the vertex partition model, for graphs subject to dynamic changes. We assume that the $n$ vertices of the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed algorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may perform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges between the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by adapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate maximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the algorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for updating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of single-edge insertions and deletions, we give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O( \lceil \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\beta k} \rceil )$ rounds that maintains a $\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $\beta$ is the available link bandwidth. For batch-dynamic updates, where the adversary may insert up to $\ell\ge 1$ edges at once, we prove the following. There is a randomized algorithm that succeeds with high probability in maintaining a $\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching and has a worst case update time of $O(\lceil\frac{\ell\log n}{\sqrt{\beta k}}\rceil )$ rounds. Any algorithm for maintaining a maximal matching without 3-augmenting paths under batches of $\ell$-edge insertions has an update time of $\Omega( \frac{\ell}{\beta k \log n} )$ rounds in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Selfish, Local and Online Scheduling via Vector Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms and the competitive ratio of online algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.
  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of this technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \sum w_j C_j$. Moreover, this approach can analyze a simple local search algorithm for $R || \sum w_j C_j$, the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \sqrt{5})/4 + \varepsilon$ and an online greedy algorithm which is $4$-competitive.</description>

      <title>Compressed data structures for Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by gluing two handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying on the surface, which define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface, where the complexity is measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates' vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compact than triangulations of 3-manifolds, yielding exponential gains for certain families. Even with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial-time algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations, detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some particular presentations of the inputs.</description>
