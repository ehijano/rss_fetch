      <title>Finite-temperature phase diagram of the BMN matrix model on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal phase structure of the Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase (BMN) matrix model using non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo calculations. Our main analyses span three orders of magnitude in the coupling, involving systems with sizes up to $N_{\tau} = 24$ lattice sites and SU($N$) gauge groups with $8 \leq N \leq 16$. In addition, we carry out extended checks of discretization artifacts for $N_{\tau} \leq 128$ and gauge group SU(4). We find results for the deconfinement temperature that interpolate between the perturbative prediction at weak coupling and the large-$N$ dual supergravity calculation at strong coupling. While we confirm that the phase transition is first order for strong coupling, it appears to be continuous for weaker couplings.</description>

      <title>An update on the determination of the sphaleron rate in finite temperature QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sphaleron rate is a key phenomenological quantity both for the axion thermal production in the Early Universe and the Chiral Magnetic Effect occurring in the Quark-Gluon Plasma in presence of a background magnetic field. In this talk we present an extension of our recent determination of the sphaleron rate, in the SU(3) gauge theory, based on the determination of the two-point function of the topological charge density at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models and stochastic quantisation in lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are currently the leading generative AI approach used for image generation in e.g. DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. In this talk we relate diffusion models to stochastic quantisation in field theory and employ it to generate configurations for scalar fields on a two-dimensional lattice. We end with some speculations on possible applications.</description>

      <title>Progress in lattice simulations for two Higgs doublet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The custodial Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model with SU(2) gauge fields is studied on the lattice. This model has the same global symmetry structure as the Standard Model but the additional Higgs field enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetries. Both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling of the custodial 2HDM are studied on a line of constant Standard Model physics with cutoff ranging from 300 to 600 GeV. The lower bounds of the realizable masses for the additional BSM scalar states are found to be well bellow the W boson mass. In fact, for the choice of quartic couplings in this work the estimated lower mass for one of the BSM states is found to be about $\sim 0.2m_{W}$ and independent of the cutoff.</description>

      <title>The gluino condensate of large-$N$ SUSY Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice determination of the SUSY $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$. We exploit large-$N$ twisted volume reduction, and present two determinations based on the Banks-Casher relation and on a Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner-like formula, both giving perfectly compatible results. By expressing the lattice results in the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov scheme, we are able for the first time to compare lattice and analytical computations, resolving a 40-year-long debate about the actual value and $N$-dependence of the gluino condensate.</description>

      <title>Applying the Triad network representation to four-dimensional ATRG method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic Tensor Renormalization Group (ATRG) is a powerful algorithm for four-dimensional tensor network calculations. However, the larger bond dimensions are known to be difficult to achieve in practice due to the higher computational cost. Adopting the methods of the minimally decomposed TRG and its triad prescriptions, we construct a triad representation of the four-dimensional ATRG by decomposing the unit-cell tensor. We observe that this combining approach can significantly improve the computational cost even with maintaining the convergence accuracy of the free energy in the four-dimensional Ising model. In addition, we also show that a further improvement can be achieved in terms of the computational cost when our proposed approach is implemented in parallel on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the chiral-even $H_g,~E_g,~\widetilde{H}_g,~\widetilde{E}_g$ and chiral-odd $H^T_g,~E^T_g, \widetilde{H}^T_g ,~\widetilde{E}^T_g$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto lightcone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the lightcone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures, and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of a pseudoscalar meson form factor in QCD with 3, 4, and 5 colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show comparisons of the pseudoscalar meson vector form factor from simulations of QCD with $N_c = 3$, 4 and 5 colors and $N_f = 2$ flavors of degenerate mass fermions at a common (matched) fermion mass, lattice spacing, and simulation volume. The dependence of the form factor on the momentum transfer is nearly independent of the number of colors, and is consistent with the expectations of vector meson dominance.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma - \bar{K}N$ coupled channels model to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy spectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the lattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons with the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of the meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$ generated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-five effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT): the effects at dimension five in the power counting. Our calculation is performed in a basis with generic mass matrices, we employ the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, and we correct for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects by including the appropriate finite counterterms. We also provide results for the $CP$-even sector in a scheme that coincides with naive dimensional regularization. We discuss two methods to avoid the explicit construction of gauge-variant operators, which in principle are needed for the cancellation of sub-divergences, even in the background-field method. The two methods are consistent with each other and with existing partial results. Our work is a further step towards a complete EFT framework for physics beyond the Standard Model at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the valence generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) of pion at zero skewness applying a theoretical approach in which the valence GPDs are related to valence quark distribution functions, directly. To this end, we use the results of modified chiral quark model ($\chi QM$) for the valence quark distributions of pion obtained in our previous work. We also determine the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of pion and compare the results of our theoretical model for valence GPDs and form factors of pion with the results of some other models and available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Kernel methods for evolution of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) characterize the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons, combining information about their internal quark and gluon longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse position within the hadron. The dependence of GPDs on the factorization scale $Q^2$ allows one to connect hard exclusive processes involving GPDs at disparate energy and momentum scales, which is needed in global analyses of experimental data. In this work we explore how finite element methods can be used to construct fast and differentiable $Q^2$ evolution codes for GPDs in momentum space, which can be used in a machine learning framework. We show numerical benchmarks of the methods' accuracy, including a comparison to an existing evolution code from PARTONS/APFEL++, and provide a repository where the code can be accessed.</description>

      <title>Decoding spin-parity quantum numbers and decay widths of double $J/\psi$ exotic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive helicity amplitudes for the fully charmed tetraquark states decays into vector meson pair under two types of models, where the one is from quark model and the other one is from heavy quark effective theory. The angular distributions have been given by the cascade decays $T_{4c}\to J/\psi(D_{(s)}^*)+J/\psi(\bar{D}_{(s)}^*)$ along with $J/\psi\to \mu^++\mu^-$ or $D_{(s)}^*\to D_{(s)}+\pi$, showing that spin-0 and spin-2 states can be distinguished. If we assume quantum entanglement as a fundamental principle, there is a strict constraint formula for helicity amplitudes. These findings will assist in experimentally differentiating various spin-parity states, determining decay widths and hunting for unobserved structures, thereby shedding light on the internal properties of double $J/\psi$ exotic states.</description>

      <title>The random coupled-plaquette gauge model and the surface code under circuit-level noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We map the decoding problem of the surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise to a disordered spin model, which we call the random coupled-plaquette gauge model (RCPGM). By coupling X- and Z-syndrome volumes, this model allows us to optimally account for genuine Y-errors in the surface code in a setting with noisy measurements. Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for the phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\%$ under uniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement compared to results obtained via the previously known "uncoupled" random plaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing Y-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level noise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric depolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite this reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the intricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for the phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\%$, to be compared to $0.7\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the Y-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the landscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In particular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that accounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code decoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder development, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen recent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is further room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical temperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action with residual mass $\sim 1\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a good chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial correlators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through various symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also present additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge at sufficiently high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>
