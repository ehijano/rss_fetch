      <title>Conserved Quantities in Expanding G\"odel Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We intend to extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content with a view to also obtaining conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Spin-up and mass-gain in hyperbolic encounters of spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering black holes spin up and gain mass through the re-absorption of orbital angular momentum and energy radiated in gravitational waves during their encounter. In this work, we perform a series of numerical relativity simulations to investigate the spin-up and mass-gain for equal-mass black holes with a wide range of equal initial spins, $\chi_{\rm i}\in[-0.7,0.7]$, aligned (or anti-aligned) to the orbital angular momentum. We also consider a variety of initial momenta. Furthermore, we explore a range of incident angles and identify the threshold between scattering and merging configurations. The spin-up and mass-gain are typically largest in systems with incident angles close to the threshold value, large momenta, and negative (i.e. anti-aligned) initial spins. When evaluated at the threshold angle, we find that the spin-up decreases linearly with initial spin. Intriguingly, systems with initial spin $\chi_{\rm i}=0.7$ sometimes experience a spin-down, in spite of an increase in the black-hole angular momentum, due to a corresponding gain in the black-hole mass. Across the simulation suite, we find a maximum spin-up of $0.3$ and a maximum increase in the black-hole mass of $15\%$.</description>

      <title>The thermal view of $f(R)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Effective spacetime description of light propagation in linear magnetoelectric media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal analogies between gravitational and optical phenomena have been explored for over a century, providing valuable insights into kinematic aspects of general relativity. Here, this analogy is employed to study light propagation in linear magnetoelectric media from an effective spacetime perspective. Starting from Maxwell's equations in covariant form, it is shown that an effective metric can always be identified for linear, non-dispersive magnetoelectric materials. The effective metric is then used to construct analog models in the limit of geometric optics. Among the optical effects analyzed, it is shown that under reasonable assumptions on the magnitude of the magnetoelectric response, a one-way propagation region can be established, which behaves analogously to an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Magnetized Neutron Stars under f (R, T ) Gravity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work investigates the structural properties of neutron stars in the presence of a strong magnetic field within the framework of f(R,T) modified gravity, where the matter-geometry coupling leads to deviations from general relativity at high matter densities. We present here the mass-radius sequences, as well as the mass and pressure distributions for various values of the modified gravity parameter and the central magnetic field. The modified Tolman-Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations are numerically solved using isotropic equations of state, specifically the APR, FPS, and SLy models. Comparing the corresponding results in the context of general relativity suggests that more negative values of the modified gravity parameter result in higher maximum gravitational masses. In contrast, strong central magnetic fields of up to 1018 Gauss cause only a slight decrease in maximum mass without disrupting spherical symmetry. Our findings are in agreement with the observed data from GW170817, PSR and NICER.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing $f(T)$ Gravity From Hubble Parameterization Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have presented the cosmological model of the Universe that represents late time cosmic acceleration in torsion based gravitational theory, the $f(T)$ gravity. A well motivated parametrization for the Hubble parameter has been introduced and the free parameters involved are constrained using the cosmological datasets. With the constrained values of the free parameters, other geometrical parameters such as deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, and snap parameter are analyzed and confronted with the prescribed value of the cosmological observations. In addition, the dynamical parameters are analyzed in some non-linear form of $f(T)$ and the energy conditions are also studied and confirmed with the violation of the strong energy condition. The obtained cosmological model provides late time phantom behavior of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Testing general relativity with gravitational waves -- improving and extending Modified Dispersion Relation tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for a modified dispersion relation is one of the general relativity tests performed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration with each new cumulative Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC). It considers classes of theories that modify the dispersion of gravitational waves by introducing a massive graviton or breaking Lorentz invariance. The symmetry breaking is parameterized phenomenologically by a momentum power law term $p^\alpha$ added to the dispersion relation, with the test placing constraints on the amplitude $A_\alpha$ of the introduced deviation. In this work, we implement improvements to the test, chief among them group velocity parametrization, a better sampling procedure, and extension to negative exponents $\alpha$ of $p$. We then reanalyze the events from the third catalog, GWTC-3, with our improved method. Compared with GWTC-3 results, we find significant improvement, mostly from the improved sampling method, in the posteriors obtained by analyzing individual event and more modest improvements in the combined bounds on amplitude parameters $A_\alpha$ -- on average, we observe 19% shrinking of posterior width. The 90% upper bound on the graviton mass changes from $2.42 \times 10^{-11}$ peV to $2.21 \times 10^{-11}$ peV. For the extension of our test to $\alpha \in \{-1, -2, -3\}$, we find no evidence in favor of general relativity violation.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless and echo modes in asymmetric Damour-Solodukhin wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is understood that the echo waveforms in ultracompact objects can be regarded as composed mainly of the asymptotic high-overtone quasinormal modes, dubbed echo modes, which predominantly lie parallel to the real frequency axis. Alternatively, Rosato {\it et al.} recently suggested that high-frequency quasi-reflectionless scattering modes are primarily responsible for the echo phenomenon. This identification relies on greybody factors as stable observables, despite the apparent spectral instability of quasinormal modes. In this work, by extending the definition of quasi-reflectionless modes to reflectionless ones and generalizing symmetric Damour-Solodukhin wormholes to asymmetric cases, we examine the underlying similarity between the reflectionless and echo mode spectra in the complex frequency plane. Through a primarily analytical treatment, we demonstrate that the asymptotic properties of these two spectra exhibit a strong resemblance, featuring an approximately uniform distribution parallel to the real frequency axis with the same spacing between successive modes. Specifically, the real parts of echo modes coincide with those of reflectionless modes at the limit $|\mathrm{Re}\omega| \gg |\mathrm{Im}\omega|$. While echo modes typically possess non-vanishing imaginary parts, the reflectionless modes of symmetric Damour-Solodukhin wormholes lie precisely on the real frequency axis, with any deviation serving as a measure of the degree of asymmetry of the wormhole. We support our derivations by employing two complementary approaches, based on the scattering matrix and the Green's function, and argue that both perspectives provide effective tools for describing the echo phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Taming singularities and chaos in conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hereby address the cosmological singularity problem in a general gravitational theory invariant under Weyl conformal transformations. In particular, we focus on the Bianchi IX spacetime and we show that both the initial (big bang) and final (big crunch) singularities disappear in an infinite class of conformal frames naturally selected according to analyticity. It turns out that the past and future singularities are both unattainable within a finite affine parameter (for massless particles) or within a finite proper time (for massive and conformally coupled particles). In order to prove such a statement, we show the geodesic completion of the spacetime when probed by massless, massive, and conformally coupled particles. Finally, the chaotic behavior of the spacetime near the singularity is tamed by a conformal rescaling that turns the Bianchi IX metric into a quasi-FLRW spacetime.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-rotating Black Hole in Kalb-Ramond Gravity: Imaging and Polarized Signatures Surrounded by Different Thick Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a spherically symmetric static black hole metric in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, and investigate the impact of relevant parameters on the black hole shadow and polarization images. For black hole shadow images, we consider two geometrically thick accretion disk models such as a phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical HOU disk model. In each case, we observe a bright ring-like structure corresponding to the higher-order images with a surrounding region of non-zero intensity that represents the primary image. The increasing values of $\hat{\lambda}$ or $\hat{\gamma}$ results in decrease the size of the higher-order image, while increasing values of observer inclination $\theta_{o}$ alter its shape and cause the horizons outline to be obscured. On the other hand, in HOU disk model, at high observer inclinations, the obscuration of the horizons outline by radiation from outside the equatorial plane is weakened. Consequently, the brightness of the primary image in the phenomenological model is significantly greater than that in the HOU disk model, indicating the strong gravitational lensing effect. For the polarized images, we use only the HOU disk model with anisotropic radiation, assuming an infalling accretion flow matter. The obtained results illustrate that the polarization intensity $P_{o}$ in the higher-order image region is significantly stronger than as compare to other regions, and it is rapidly decreases away from this region. The variation in $\hat{\lambda}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ depicts the intrinsic structure of the space-time and $\theta_o$ depends on the observers orientation, together they shape the polarization features.</description>

      <title>Impact of a third body on binary neutron star tidal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For waveform modelling of compact binary coalescence, it is conventionally assumed that the binary is in isolation. In this work, we break that assumption and introduce a third body at a distance. The primary goal is to understand how the distant third body would affect the binary dynamics. However, in the present work, we treat the three-body problem perturbatively and study tidal interaction in the binary due to the third body's presence. We introduce appropriate modifications to the equations governing the orbital motions and the evolution equations of the binary component's quadrupole moment. Further, we obtain the radiated energy and accumulated dephasing for the binary. We show that for b-EMRI, the effect is weak in the tidal sector, while for systems such as b-IMRIs, it would be most relevant to study these effects.</description>

      <title>Long-lived modes and grey-body factors of massive fields in quantum-corrected (Hayward) black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a massive scalar field in the background of the Hayward black hole, which can be interpreted both as a regular spacetime and as an effective geometry arising from Asymptotically Safe gravity. The quasinormal spectrum and grey-body factors are computed using the WKB method with Pad\'e improvements and confirmed through time-domain integration followed by Prony analysis. We find that the mass of the field significantly suppresses the damping rate of quasinormal oscillations, giving rise to long-lived modes that continuously approach arbitrarily long-lived states (quasi-resonances) at certain critical field masses. In the time domain, the standard exponentially decaying ringdown is replaced by oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope. The corresponding grey-body factors reveal a pronounced shift of the transmission peak toward higher frequencies and a suppression of the low-frequency part of the spectrum. Finally, we show that the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors remains valid for massive fields, being highly accurate for large multipole numbers and gradually losing precision as either the field mass increases or the multipole number decreases.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbation around a rotating Kalb-Ramond BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scalar perturbation of a newly proposed Kalb-Ramond (KR) BTZ-like black hole. After the separation of variables for the Klein-Gordon equation, we find that the radial part reduces to the general Heun equation. Using the Heun function, we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) subject to generic Robin boundary conditions, which shows that the KR parameter substantially modifies the QNM spectrum and only the fundamental mode on the left branch has an instability. To ascertain whether the instability is superradiant, we further analyze how the KR field changes the energy and angular momentum fluxes. Our results show that the KR parameter shifts the threshold and the range of the Robin coupling parameter where the superradiance occurs, underscoring the importance of the KR field in modeling black hole perturbations.</description>

      <title>Wormhole geometries in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first study of traversable wormhole solutions in the background of Einstein-Aether theory. We show that the field equations admit some wormhole geometries, for several combinations of values of the aether coupling constants. We investigating the null and weak energy conditions for wormhole solutions with three types of the worm hole shape function. In contrast to Einstein gravity, we find that by choosing adequate values for the parameters of the models, wormhole geometries respect the energy conditions at the wormhole throat and also throughout the whole space. Satisfaction of these energy conditions led to some constraints on the value of the Einstein-Aether theory. Comparing these constraints with those previously obtained from theoretical and observational considerations, we find that the satisfaction of energy condition put more limitations on the values of the Einstein-Aether couplings.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Black Hole Ringdown Signals with Data Gaps using a Deep-Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks. Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a foundation for the following scientific work.</description>

Abstract: The final fate of a collapsing star depends not only on how much matter it contains but also on how that matter resists gravity in different directions. In this work, we investigate the final fate of highly magnetized radiation-dominated spherically symmetric dissipative stellar configurations. We study the dynamics of collapse by introducing a dimensionless geometric factor $f(\theta, \phi)$ defined by the angular dependence of the radiative opacity. Using the field equations, we derive direction-sensitive threshold conditions that determine whether collapse initiates, halts, or reverses. The resulting inequalities unify black hole formation, bounce behavior, and delayed trapping of geodesics into a single geometrically controlled framework. This theoretical analysis would help analyze the collapse through pre-computed opacity tables for different magnetic field, temperature, and density profiles, along with other data available for such considered profiles.</description>

      <title>From Spray to Metric: The Geometric Construction of the Jacobi Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic approach to the geometrization of dynamics from the viewpoint of the geodesic equation. The method promotes a semispray to a spray through the imposition of suitable dynamical constraints, and the associated metric structure is extracted via reparameterization. When applied to static spacetimes, this spray-to-metric framework recovers the optical metric, the Jacobi metric for massive particles, and its generalization for charged particles in electromagnetic fields. We further show that a Randers-type Finsler metric arises naturally in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. By establishing a direct pathway from equations of motion to metric structures, this work offers a geometric perspective, independent of the traditional variational framework, may provide a basis for further studies on dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative dyonic black holes sourced by nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent results concerning the complete class of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ equations of type D with a double-aligned electromagnetic field are summarized. This large class of spacetimes includes charged black holes with rotation, NUT parameter, and acceleration. In particular, we present their Plebanski-Demianski, Griffiths-Podolsky-Vratny, and Astorino metric representations, we discuss mutual relations between them, and demonstrate their usefulness for investigation of physical and geometrical properties (singularities, horizons, conformal diagrams, ergoregions, rotating strings causing the acceleration, thermodynamics). It includes the proof that such black holes emit gravitational radiation if, and only if, they accelerate. Very recent extension to type D black holes with non-aligned Maxwell field is also mentioned.</description>

      <title>Can we identify primordial black holes? The role of subsolar gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the most compelling signatures of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). We critically examine whether such systems can be distinguished from stellar binaries, such as those composed of neutron stars (NSs), which could also populate the subsolar mass range. Unlike PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which increase by several orders of magnitude as the mass decreases. We forecast the capability of current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors to constrain tidal effects in putative subsolar binaries. We also discuss the broader implications that the detection of a subsolar merger would have for both cosmology and nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: Globally hyperbolic spacetimes endowed with a time function $t$ whose spacelike slices $t=t_0$ have constant curvature $k(t_0)$ and where the sign of $k(t_0)$ (as well as the topology of the slice) varies with $t_0$, can be constructed despite some common claims about the implications of the classical Cosmological Principle. Here, we stress the possibilities of these cosmologies and announce the development of new models obtained in collaboration with G. Garc\'{\i}a-Moreno, B. Janssen, A. Jim\'enez-Cano, M. Mars and R.

      <title>Black holes in a dense infinite medium: a toy-model regularizing the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of a black hole accreting energy from a surrounding homogeneous and infinite space. We argue for a simple heuristic modification of the Schwarzschild approximation when the density of the medium is not negligible anymore. The resulting behavior is drastically modified: the mass divergence at finite time is cured and the thermodynamical properties are deeply changed. Some potential consequences for quantum gravity and bouncing models are also pointed out. Those conclusions being mostly obtained from a Newtonian approach, they only aim at guiding toward a more rigorous treatment. Still, interestingly, the behavior is far more convincing that the one usually obtained.</description>

      <title>Analytical sensitivity curves of the second-generation time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will employ second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress laser frequency noise and achieve the sensitivity required for GW detection. We introduce an inverse light-path operator $\mathcal{P}_{i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\ldots i_{n-1}i_{n}}$, which enables simple representation of second-generation TDI combinations and a concise description of light propagation. Analytical expressions and high-accuracy approximate formulas are derived for the sky- and polarization-averaged response functions, noise power spectral densities (PSDs), and sensitivity curves of TDI Michelson, ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$), Monitor, Beacon, Relay, and Sagnac combinations, as well as their orthogonal $A, E, T$ channels. Our results show that: (i) second-generation TDIs have the same sensitivities as their first-generation counterparts; (ii) the $A, E, T$ sensitivities and the optimal sensitivity are independent of the TDI generation and specific combination; (iii) the $A$ and $E$ channels have equal averaged responses, noise PSDs, and sensitivities, while the $T$ channel has much weaker response and sensitivity at low frequencies ($2\pi fL/c\lesssim3$); (iv) except for the $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $\zeta$ combinations and the $T$ channel, all sensitivity curves exhibit a flat section in the range $f_{n}&lt;f\lesssim 1.5/(2\pi L/c)$, where the noise-balance frequency $f_{n}$ separates the proof-mass- and optical-path-dominated regimes, while the response-transition frequency $\sim 1.5/(2\pi L/c)$ separates the response function's low- and high-frequency behaviors; (v) the averaged response, noise PSD, and sensitivity of $\zeta$ scales with those of the $T$ channel. These analytical and approximate formulations provide useful benchmarks for instrument optimization and data-analysis studies for future space-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Hotspot Images Driven by Magnetic Reconnection in Kerr-Sen black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Kerr-Sen black hole, this study investigates the changes in hotspot images before and after the occurrence of magnetic reconnection. After reviewing the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection process and introducing the hotspot imaging method, we examine the temporal evolution of hotspot intensity, including when energy extraction occurs, when it does not occur, and when the observer's azimuthal angle is altered. We also discuss the influence of the black hole's expansion parameter and spin on hotspot imaging. The results indicate that the first flare may serve as a potential signature of ongoing energy extraction: changing the observer's azimuthal angle may alter the time interval between the first and second flares: a larger expansion parameter makes it more difficult to identify the energy extraction signal, and a higher spin also makes it more challenging to detect the energy extraction signal.</description>

      <title>Novel topological subclass in Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the universal classification of thermodynamic topology for charged static black holes within the $z=3$ Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity theory, considering both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We introduce a new topological subclass, denoted as $\ddot{W}^{1-}$. This finding expands the existing topological classification, going beyond the five previously defined classes and their respective subclasses. The $\ddot{W}^{1-}$ subclass presents a distinct and previously unobserved stability profile: In the low-temperature regime, an unstable small black hole appears in the phase space, whereas, while in the high temperature regime, two unstable small black holes exist together with a stable large black hole. Our study underscores the dependence of charged black hole stability on the selection of the ensemble. These results contribute to refining and expanding the topological framework in black hole thermodynamics, providing key perspectives on the underlying nature of black holes and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate several geometrical and physical properties of the recently found $W$-soliton solution (neutral case). We discuss both the genuine 5d solution and its reduction to 4d and highlight similarities and differences. In both cases, we study scattering processes of massless and massive particles in the background, reconstructing the gauge-invariant scattering angle, either with exact expressions or with large-angular momentum expansion expressions, which we show how to resum in a useful form. Finally, we analyze the propagation of a test scalar field in the $W$-soliton background and compute the spectrum of Quasi Normal Modes in the case of (non-)minimal coupling and the radiated energy in the case of minimal coupling. Our result for the energy loss is fully analytic and presented in a Post-Newtonian expansion, following the approach termed gravitational self force.</description>

      <title>Robustness of timelike circular orbit topology against particle spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a detailed study of the motion of spinning test particles within the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon formalism under the Tulczyjew spin-supplementary condition in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we investigate the topological properties of timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for such particles. By constructing an auxiliary potential and an associated vector field on the equatorial plane, we compute the topological winding number W for regions between horizons and outside the outermost horizon in asymptotically flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) black hole spacetimes. Our results show that between two neighboring horizons (including the cosmological horizon in the dS case), the topological number is W=-1, indicating the presence of at least one unstable TCO. Outside the outermost horizon, we find W=0 for both asymptotically flat and AdS black holes, implying that any TCOs must appear in stable-unstable pairs or be absent. These conclusions are independent of the spin orientation (co-rotating or counter-rotating) of the test particle. The analysis is supported by explicit examples in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS, and Schwarzschild-dS spacetimes, confirming the general topological predictions. While the effective potential for spinning particles has been previously studied, the topological approach employed here reveals invariant properties that remain robust even when spin is included, thereby highlighting the fundamental influence of the spacetime structure itself.</description>

      <title>The images of Brans-Dicke-Kerr type naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the images of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with a dimensionless Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$, which belongs to axisymmetric rotating solutions in the Brans-Dicke theory. Our results show that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with the parameter $\omega&gt;-3/2$ represents naked singularities with distinct structures. For the case with $a \leq M$, the shadow in the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime persists, gradually becomes flatter and smaller as $\omega$ decreases. Especially when $\omega&lt;1/2$, the shadow in the image exhibit a very special ``jellyfish" shape and possesses a self-similar fractal structure. For the case with $a &gt; M$, a distinct gray region consisting of two separate patches appears in the image observed by equatorial observers. This indicating that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime can be distinguished from the Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter cases based on its image. These effects of the Brans-Dicke parameter could help us to reveal the intrinsic structure of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetimes and provide a foundation for testing Brans-Dicke theory through future high-precision observations.</description>

      <title>Shadow of Extreme Compact Charged Objects in Consistent 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to better describe gravitational phenomena on both very small and cosmological scales, there have been constant attempts to generalize and expand the theory of General Relativity (GR) since its inception. The Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) theory is one such extension that adds spacetime corrections related to curvature. Since the standard Gauss Bonnet term is purely topological, it does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions. To get around this restriction, however, an invariant four dimensional limit has been developed. In this work, we study Extreme Compact Charged Objects (ECCOs), which can resemble black holes, in a gravity framework that is compatible with Einstein Gauss Bonnet in four dimensions. Our main goal is to compare theoretical predictions with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data in order to constrain the Gauss Bonnet coupling constant {\alpha}. In order to achieve this, we investigate important optical characteristics like the shadow, light bending angle, and other associated observables, as well as the geodesic structure of ECCO spacetimes in EGB gravity. Finally, we apply these findings to constrain the Gauss Bonnet constant.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.</description>

      <title>Does the survival and sudden death of quadripartite steering in curved spacetime truly depend on multi-directionality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the directional dependence of Gaussian quadripartite quantum steering and its redistribution among different modes in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. For physically accessible sectors, we identify three distinct behaviors: (i) steering from non-gravitational to gravitational observers undergoes sudden death at maximal asymmetry with the Hawking temperature, marking the crossover from two-way to one-way steerability; (ii) steering in the opposite direction decays monotonically and vanishes only in the extreme black hole limit, highlighting its directional sensitivity to spacetime curvature; (iii) steering from hybrid gravitational-non-gravitational partitions to non-gravitational mode persists at a finite asymptotic value set by the initial squeezing parameter. Moreover, all inaccessible steerings generated by the Hawking effect exhibit an intrinsic asymmetry, with their specific behavior being strongly dependent on the steering direction.</description>

Abstract: The idea of extra spatial dimensions arises from attempts to unify gravity with other fundamental interactions, develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity, and address open problems in particle physics and cosmology. Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding how such dimensions modify gravitational theories. One way to probe their impact is through the analytical study of astrophysical processes such as black hole accretion. Since accretion efficiently converts gravitational energy into radiation, this makes it a powerful tool to test modified gravity (MOG) theories and higher-dimensional frameworks via the behavior of dark compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of neutral particles around a higher-dimensional, regular, spherically symmetric MOG compact object, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), energy flux, temperature, and differential luminosity. We further analyze the accretion of a perfect fluid onto the same object, deriving analytical expressions for the four-velocity and proper energy density of the inflowing matter. Our findings show that extra dimensions reduce the ISCO radius while enhancing the corresponding flux and temperature. Finally, by comparing the effective disk temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$ with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, we argue that MOG and higher-dimensional corrections to the accretion disk properties could be close to the current threshold of detectability.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Gravity Beyond General Relativity: Insights from Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory of modified gravity with nontrivial spacetime torsion. In particular, we show that the semiclassical treatment can be axiomatized in the case of Einstein--Cartan theory with a nonminimally coupled, free Klein--Gordon field, in four dimensions. Using Hadamard renormalization, we obtain well-defined expectation values for both, the energy--momentum and spin--density operators. These objects exhibit scale and renormalization ambiguities; we identify the latter by constructing a renormalization Lagrangian in terms of differential forms, which are particularly well suited for this purpose. Furthermore, we analyze the conformal anomaly, which persists in the presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis constraints on generalized mass-to-horizon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the cosmological framework based on a generalized mass-to-horizon entropy. This entropy, recently proposed as a power-law extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, arises from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius relation. By applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, the resulting corrections to the Friedmann equations modify the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Consequently, even the standard supergravity coupling between the Ricci scalar and the baryon current can generate a non-vanishing matter-antimatter asymmetry. Comparison with observational data yields a stringent constraint on the entropic exponent, namely $0 &lt; 1 - n \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, at the decoupling temperature $T_D \simeq 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}$, corresponding to the current upper limit on tensor-mode fluctuations at the inflationary scale. These findings indicate that minor, subtle, yet physically significant departures, from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy ($n = 1$) may be required to achieve full consistency with present cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>On energy and its positivity in spacetimes with an expanding flat de Sitter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The positive energy theorems are a fundamental pillar in mathematical general relativity. Originally proved by Schoen-Yau and later Witten, these theorems were established for asymptotically flat manifolds where the metric tends to the standard Euclidean metric and whose second fundamental form decays to zero at infinity. This ansatz on the metric and second fundamental form is motivated by the desire to model an isolated gravitational system with a Minkowski space background for the spacetime. However, actual astrophysical massive objects are not truly isolated but rather exist within an expanding cosmological universe, where the second fundamental form is umbilic. With this in mind, we seek a notion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form. In this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding cosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as the background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is foliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This cosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the presence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one. We define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to our framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Testing bosonic dark matter through white dwarf mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of white dwarfs via electromagnetic methods, often differ from those obtained through gravitational redshift measurements, in some cases with discrepancies ranging in $5-15\%$ across independent datasets. Although many of the discrepancies reported in large spectroscopic surveys and confirmed by high-precision techniques such as astrometric microlensing and wide-binary analyses may be attributable to thermal effects, model uncertainties or measurement errors prevent a complete description of some of the observations. Here, we explore an alternative explanation based on the presence of a gravitationally coupled bosonic scalar field that contributes to the stellar mass while remaining electromagnetically invisible. We construct stationary, static mixed configurations consisting of a white dwarf that presents a bosonic scalar field (dark matter) component, forming a composite white dwarf-boson star system. We explore families of solutions showing that a scalar field fraction $f_{\rm DM} \sim 5-15\%$ to the mass contribution can account for the observed redshift excess. Our models provide a physically motivated explanation for the mass bias, might offer new observational signatures, and allow us to place preliminary constraints on the mass and compactness of the scalar field configuration. Finally, using our theoretical framework in combination with Bayesian model selection we provide plausible bounds for the mass of the constituent (ultralight) bosonic particle.</description>

      <title>Every Wrinkle Carries A Memory: An Integro-differential Bootstrap for Features in Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological observations, we push the cosmological bootstrap program beyond the de Sitter invariance lamppost by considering correlators that explicitly break scale invariance, thereby exhibiting primordial features. For exchange processes involving heavy fields with time-dependent masses and sound speeds, we demonstrate that locality in the bulk implies a set of integro-differential equations for correlators on the boundary. These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations. Meanwhile, we also unveil non-perturbative information in the integro-differential equations by resumming apparent infrared divergences as parametric resonances. In addition, we provide a first-of-its-kind example of numerical bootstrap that directly maps out the solution space of such boundary equations. Finally, we compute the bispectrum and uncover, in the squeezed limit, a scale-breaking cosmological collider signal, whose amplitude can be exponentially enhanced (with respect to the Boltzmann suppression) due to particle production triggered by high-frequency mass oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifshitz black hole solutions pose particular challenges for reconciling the two main formulations of the classical double copy: the Kerr-Schild double copy and the Weyl double copy. Recent work has suggested that consistency between the two can be restored, in certain cases, only by adopting a regularization prescription in the Weyl double copy. In this paper, we test this prescription on three examples from the literature, each with a distinct novel feature, and show that the prescription remains valid in all cases.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Quantum Gravity and Finite $N$ Chiral Primaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory on AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$ $\times$ $\mathcal{M}_4$ provides a well-studied realization of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holography, but its non-perturbative structure at finite $N \sim 1/G_N^{(3)}$ is largely unknown. A long-standing puzzle concerns the stringy exclusion principle: what bulk mechanism can reproduce the boundary expectation that the chiral primary Hilbert space of the symmetric orbifold contains only a finite number of states at finite $N$? In this work, we present a bulk prescription for computing the finite $N$ spectrum of chiral primary states in symmetric orbifolds of $\mathbb{T}^4$ or K3. We show that the integer spectrum at any $N$ is reproduced exactly by summing over one-loop supersymmetric partition functions of the IIB theory on (AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$)/$\mathbb{Z}_k$ $\times$ $\mathcal{M}_4$ orbifolds and their spectral flows. Using the worldsheet in the tensionless limit, we verify that the terms appearing in our proposal coincide with the partition functions of these orbifold geometries and their asymmetric generalizations. These partition functions contribute with alternating signs due to BPS modes with negative conformal dimensions and charges in twisted sectors. The resulting alternating sum collapses via large cancellations to the finite $N$ polynomials observed in symmetric orbifold CFTs, providing a bulk explanation of the stringy exclusion principle. We identify different Stokes sectors where different infinite subsets of these geometries contribute to the path integral, and propose a classification as functions of the chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Principle of Minimal Heating for Collapse and Hybrid Gravitational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy nonconservation is a prominent, testable prediction of collapse and hybrid classical-quantum gravitational models. Without smearing of certain operators, the associated heating (or energy increase) rate diverges, yet the smearing distribution is arbitrary and, on scales much larger than the smearing length $r_C$, much of the phenomenology is expected to be independent of this choice. We propose to resolve this arbitrariness by a simple principle: for a fixed $r_C$, select the distribution that minimizes the heating rate. Conceptually, this should identify the minimal deviation from standard quantum mechanics and provide models that, once experimentally refuted, would strongly disfavor all variants with different distributions. We apply this approach to the most investigated collapse models: GRW, CSL, and DP. Notably, the Gaussian is optimal only for the GRW case. Finally, we apply it to the Tilloy-Di\'osi hybrid classical-quantum model of Newtonian gravity, leading to the minimally deviating variant of it. This version of the model is entirely determined by only one free parameter (the smearing length $r_C$) and, if experimentally refuted, would strongly disfavor any other version of it.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy for nonlocal field theories displays a universal ``volume law" scaling \cite{Barbon:2008ut, Karczmarek:2013xxa, Shiba:2013jja, Pang:2014tpa} as opposed to the ``area law" scaling for local field theories. The aim of this work is to determine whether complexity displays any such an universal scaling laws. The field theories considered here are obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory by higher dimension operators introducing nonlocality, namely a dipole deformation and noncommutativity (NCSYM) by turning on world volume Kalb-Ramond $B$ field. The dual gravity backgrounds have a running dilaton, in addition to the $B$-field background, which alter AdS asymptotics. Our results capture nonlocality in the hyperscaling behavior for complexity. We also compute the subregion complexity which display phase transitions in the nonlocal field theories with the transition point being the same as that for the phase transition of entanglement entropy \cite{Karczmarek:2013xxa}. These new results dovetail nicely with our findings from our previous works \cite{Chakraborty:2020fpt, Katoch:2022hdf, Bhattacharyya:2022ren} on other lower dimensional nonlocal field theories such as little string theories (LSTs) and warped conformal field theories (WCFTs).</description>

      <title>Probing Short-Distance Modifications of Gravity via Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent Effects in Muonic Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of muonic atoms provides a powerful probe for new short-range interactions predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we derive new constraints on both spin-independent and spin-dependent non-Newtonian gravity by leveraging the outstanding sensitivity of these systems. For spin-independent Yukawa-type forces, we analyze two complementary approaches: the $2S-2P$ Lamb shift in the muonic helium-4 ion and the deuteron-proton squared charge radii difference obtained from the muonic hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift. The found constraints have reached a competitive level at sub-picometer scales, with the isotope shift method yielding the most stringent bounds for interaction ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-13}\text{m}$. For spin-dependent effects, we analyze the influence of the gravitational spin-orbit coupling on the $2P_{3/2}-2P_{1/2}$ fine-structure splitting in muonic helium, establishing new limits on Post-Newtonian parameters. These bounds are shown to be more restrictive than those from other leading experimental techniques for ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-10}\text{m}$. Our findings highlight the widespread usefulness of muonic atoms in exploring new fundamental physics at short-distance scales.</description>

      <title>The CatWISE2020 Quasar dipole: A Reassessment of the Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <title>Wiggling boundary and corner edge modes in JT gravity with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge modes (GrEMs) and gauge edge modes (GaEMs) in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity on a wiggling boundary. The wiggling effect manifests as a series of spacetime topological and bulk constraints for both conical and wormhole defect solutions. For the conical defect solution, we employ the generalized Fefferman-Graham (F-G) gauge to extend the boundary action, allowing for non-constant temperature and horizon position. We find that the infrared behavior of this boundary action is determined by the local dynamics of the temperature and horizon. For the wormhole defect solution, the boundary action can, in special cases, be described by a field with variable mass subject to a constant external force. We classify this corner system as a first-class constrained system influenced by field decomposition, confirming that the physical degrees of freedom are determined by constraints from the wiggling boundary information. We find that GrEMs and GaEMs can be linked at the corners by imposing additional constraints. Additionally, we show that the ``parallelogram'' composed of corner variables exhibits discreteness under a unitary representation. Finally, we explore that information from extrinsic vectors can be packaged into the GaEMs via a Maurer-Cartan form, revealing the boundary degrees of freedom as two copies of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. By separating pure gauge transformations, we identify the gluing condition for gauge invariance and the corresponding integrable charges.</description>

      <title>8D conformal gravity with Einstein sector, and its relation to the Q-curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>On the phase of the de Sitter density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-loop gravitational path integral around Euclidean de Sitter space $S^D$ has a complex phase that casts doubt on a state counting interpretation. Recently, it was proposed to cancel this phase by including an observer. We explore this proposal in the case where the observer is a charged black hole in equilibrium with the de Sitter horizon. We compute the phase of the one-loop determinant within a two-dimensional dilaton gravity reduction, using both numerical and analytical methods. Our results interpolate between previous studies of a probe geodesic observer and the Nariai solution. We also revisit the prescription for going from the Euclidean path integral to the state-counting partition function, finding a positive sign in the final density of states.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave from graviton bremsstrahlung in inflaton decay into massive spin 3/2 particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves would offer a direct evidence of inflation and valuable insights into the dynamics of the early universe. During post-inflation reheating period, when the inflaton coherently oscillates at the bottom of its potential, primordial stochastic gravitational waves may be sourced by its perturbative decay into particles of different spins. Assuming the behavior of the potential near the minimum as a polynomial $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$, where $k\ge 2$, and treating the inflaton as coherently oscillating classical field, we calculate the decay of inflaton into a pair of spin $3/2$ particles accompanied by graviton emission. We numerically study the reheating dynamics and calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectra. Our analysis shows that the gravitational wave spectra can offer insights into the microscopic physics during inflation.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf ZTF J0538+1953 as the brightest verification binary for space laser interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A decrease in the orbital period of the ultrashort-period binary white dwarf \ZTF, which is one of the Galactic verification binaries in the millihertz frequency range for planned space laser interferometers, has been measured. Based on photometric observations carried out on the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow State University (CMO SAI MSU), a diagram \textit{O-C} is constructed. It can be described by quadratic elements of the brightness variation, which correspond to a decrease rate of the orbital period of the system of $dP/dt=-(1.16\pm 0.22)\times 10^{-11}$ s/s. The decrease rate of the orbital period in the quadrupole approximation for the emission of gravitational waves by a binary system corresponds to its chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=0.434\pm 0.05 M_\odot$, which turned out to be $\sim 30\%$ higher than the value obtained earlier from spectroscopic mass determination. The chirp mass of \ZTF inferred from the measured orbital decay rate makes this system the brightest Galactic verification binary for LISA and TianQin space interferometers with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx 119$ and $\approx 30$ over 5 years and 2.5 years of observations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of solar chameleons with electron recoil data from XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reassess prospects for direct detection of solar chameleons, in light of recent progress in modeling their production, and the availability of new XENONnT data. We show that the contribution from Primakoff production in the electric fields of electrons and ions dominates the electron recoil event rate, which is enhanced compared to earlier estimates based on magnetic conversion in the tachocline alone. We argue that the signal is governed by the effective coupling $\beta_{\text{eff}} \equiv \beta_{\gamma}M_e^{-4}$, which encodes the combined effects of production and detection, where $\beta_{\gamma}$ and $M_e$ are the chameleon-photon (conformal) coupling and chameleon-electron disformal coupling scale, respectively. Setting the height of the chameleon potential to the dark energy (DE) scale $\Lambda \simeq 2.4\,{\text{meV}}$, we show that XENONnT electron recoil data set the upper limit $\log_{10}\beta_{\text{eff}}&lt;-6.9$. This limit is independent of the conformal matter coupling $\beta_m$ and index $n$, and applies to the whole class of inverse power-law chameleons, well beyond the $n=1$ case usually studied. We comment on how future multi-target experiments and lower-threshold analyses could distinguish solar chameleons from other light (pseudo)scalar particles such as axions. Our work demonstrates that existing dark matter direct detection experiments can probe regions of parameter space relevant to screened DE models, providing complementary tests to astrophysical and fifth-force searches at no additional experimental cost.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from a Massive Vector Field in Generalized Proca Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we emphasise the recent observational findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2), which provide compelling evidence for a possible deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM (Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving effective dark energy component. Motivated by this, we construct a theoretical framework in which a massive cosmological vector field, $B^{\mu}$, couples non-minimally to the background curvature through marginal interactions, offering a controlled mechanism to realise the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. A detailed analysis of the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter $w(\tilde H)$ reveals a narrow region of parameter space consistent with current cosmological observations presented by DESI. The analysis yields a stringent upper bound for the coupling constant $\lambda$ to be $\lambda&lt;2.98\times10^{-11}$, a very strong bound on mass $3.1356\times10^{-66}~\text{g} \leq m \leq 3.3627\times10^{-66}~\text{g},$ and the admissible range $-0.405 \leq \log_{10}\tilde\gamma \leq -0.38$ for which present-day value $w_0 = w(\tilde H = 1)$ corresponding to a deviation $\delta = w_0 + 1$ that lies within the region $0.107 \leq \delta \leq 0.217$. This interval reproduces the deviation inferred from the combined DESI, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Pantheon+ data, reflecting a controlled departure from the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed framework of a massive vector field can account for the departure from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour highlighted by DESI in the current cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, the framework approaches the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in late-time $t\gtrsim28$ Gyr, establishing a direct phenomenological link between the underlying parameters and the observed dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Light Scalars in Light of UV/IR Mixing: Classicalization via Synergy between Vainshtein &amp; Chameleon Screenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories featuring light scalar fields play a pivotal role in addressing fundamental questions in (astro)particle physics and cosmology. However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects -- referred to as classicalons -- which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.</description>

      <title>The double copy effective action: a quantum (chromodynamics) approach to space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Lagrangian formulations of gauge and gravity theories emphasize compactness and off-shell symmetry. This often obscures the structure of on-shell physical observables. In this work, we present a constructive framework that elevates gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes to the defining data for quantum field theory actions, including effective field theories. Focusing on double-copy theories, we promote color-dual amplitude numerators to quantum operators. This enables the systematic identification of novel local operator content at each multiplicity and the construction of double-copy-compatible actions. By applying this framework to the well-established double-copy relationship between Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills theory, which holds for all-multiplicity tree-level amplitudes, we demonstrate a systematic path to constructing the operator expansion of $\sqrt{-g}R$ from factorized gauge-theory components. This clarifies how gravitational interactions can be understood as emerging from simpler gauge-theoretic structures at the action level. This formalism extends color-kinematics duality from amplitude data to operator constructions, naturally realizing the double copy at the level of actions and asymptotic quantum states. We illustrate the method with Yang-Mills theory, Einstein gravity, and its application to generating higher-derivative operators inspired by Z-theory and open superstring amplitudes. This work provides a concrete bridge between structured amplitudes and effective actions, offering a physically grounded alternative to traditional EFT basis-building. It reveals at the operator level deep structural connections between gauge theory and gravity (connections long recognized in scattering amplitudes) from fundamental interactions to their quantum state descriptions and higher-derivative extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking radiation spectrum from a collapsing null shell can be derived via the double copy of a simpler gauge theory calculation. Analyzing the non-abelian Yang-Mills root of this process, we demonstrate that the radiation spectrum is thermal in the color charge eigenvalue $\lambda$, not energy. Considering the $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory in the large $N_c$ limit, we find the differential spectrum $dN/ d\lambda$ is a product of the gravitationally familiar Planck-like factor and the color phase space density, modeled here as the Wigner semicircle from random matrix theory. This reveals that apparent energy thermality in gravity is the direct dual of charge thermality in its underlying non-abelian gauge theory.</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microstructures of a charged AdS (Anti-de Sitter) black hole exhibiting quantum anomalies through the lens of Ruppeiner geometry. Previous research has established that black holes undergo $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit critical phenomena near their critical points, characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. However, recent findings have revealed that black holes with quantum anomalies can violate these scaling laws. Motivated by these discoveries, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations and gain insights into the microstructure of such black holes. Our analysis aims to elucidate how quantum effects modify the microscopic properties of spacetime, offering a novel perspective on the understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from equatorially eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals around swirling Kerr black holes</title>

Abstract: The swirling-Kerr black hole is a novel solution of vacuum general relativity and has an extra swirling parameter characterizing the rotation of spacetime background. We have studied the gravitational waves generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) along eccentric orbits on equatorial plane in this novel swirling spacetime. Our findings indicate that this swirling parameter leads to a delayed phase shift in the gravitational waveforms. Furthermore, we have investigated effects of the swirling parameter on the potential issue of waveform confusion caused by the orbital eccentricity and semi-latus rectum parameters. As the swirling parameter increases, the relative variations in the eccentricity increase, while the variations in the semi-latus rectum decrease rapidly. These trends of the changes related to the orbital eccentricity and the semi-latus rectum with the swirling parameter resemble those observed with the MOG parameter in the Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity (STVG) theory, but with different rates of change. Furthermore, our results also reveal that effects of the background swirling parameter on the relative variations in the eccentricity and the semi-latus rectum are distinctly different from those of the black hole spin parameter. These results provide deeper insights into the properties of EMRI gravitational waves and the background's swirling.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>

Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in the context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at frequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly de-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they differ under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics amplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one, especially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the amplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be considerably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\sim}100\:{\rm M_\odot}-200\:{\rm M_\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at frequencies ${\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics, which may help us distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Dirac equation for a particle in the background of the Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) spacetime by applying the tetrad formalism, and separate the angular and radial parts. We get the system of two differential equations for angular functions and the system of four differential equations for radial functions. We solve the angular equations in terms of hypergeometric functions and find the NUT-charge dependent quantization rule for the angular separation constant. As a result of studying the radial equations, we demonstrate that the probability of particle-antiparticle production on the outer event horizon decreases with the increase of the NUT charge. For the massless fermion, we construct the solution of the radial system of Dirac equation in terms of the confluent Heun functions that allows to get the NUT-charge dependent scattering resonances with imaginary energies. Under the assumption of small NUT charge, we study the extremal NUT black hole with a single horizon, when the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy vanishes identically, and reveal the non-zero NUT charge effects in wave characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform Bertotti-Robinson magnetic field: An exact solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.</description>

Abstract: The time-like structure of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat Horndeski black holes is studied in detail. Focusing on the motion of massive neutral test particles, we construct the corresponding effective potential and classify the admissible types of orbits. The equations of motion are solved analytically, yielding trajectories expressed in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity.</description>

      <title>Universal topological classes of black holes surrounded by quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the universal topological classes of various black hole configurations immersed in a quintessence field. The results indicate that the Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence is of the $W^{1-}$ type, exhibiting thermodynamic instability in both extremal temperature limits. The introduction of rotation alters its topological nature to the $W^{0+}$ class, where the Kerr black hole displays coexistence of a stable small black hole and an unstable large black hole at low temperatures. In comparison, anti de Sitter (adS) black holes display different thermodynamic topologies. The Schwarzschild-adS solution corresponds to the $W^{0-}$ class, where an unstable small branch and a stable large branch emerge in the high temperatures. Meanwhile, the Kerr-adS classified as $W^{1+}$, maintains stability in both high- and low-temperature limits. Furthermore, the 4D/5D quintessential black hole belongs to the $W^{0+}$ class within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet framework. Overall, parameters such as rotation and Gauss-Bonnet in quintessence background field affect the topological classifications of the black holes, while the quintessence field primarily modifies the stability range without changing the topological class itself.</description>

      <title>Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints. An extension of our ACT-consistent inflation model to the unified $F(R)$-gravity description of Starobinsky-like inflation and production of primordial black holes on a smaller scale is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature-matter coupled gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.</description>

      <title>Rotating Charged Black Holes with Scalar Hair Constructed via the Newman-Janis Algorithm: Accretion Disk Structure and Shadow Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generate a rotating charged black hole (BH) with scalar hair via the Newman--Janis algorithm (NJA) and study its thin accretion disk and shadow. The structure of the event horizon and ergosurface is analyzed in detail, revealing how the charge parameter $Q$ and scalar hair parameter $s$ influence the spacetime geometry. We analyze the energy flux and temperature distribution of the accretion disk, finding that increasing either $Q$ or $s$ leads to higher energy flux and peak temperature. The BH shadow is also examined, showing that its apparent size decreases monotonically with increasing $Q$ or $s$. Notably, in the near-extremal regime, the shadow develops a distinctive cuspy edge, indicative of strong light bending in the scalarized and charged spacetime. By comparing the theoretically predicted shadow diameter with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A$^*$, we derive observational constraints on the model parameters. For inclination angles of $17^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, a joint analysis constrains the charge parameter to $0&lt;Q&lt;0.522745$ (at fixed $s=0.1$) and the scalar hair parameter to $0&lt;s&lt;0.283373$ (at fixed $Q=0.3$). Our results demonstrate how scalar hair and electric charge leave imprints on accretion disk emissions and black hole shadows, offering new observational signatures for testing gravity theories beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 3$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Entropy of de Sitter (d+1)-spacetime: modification of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of cosmological horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the connection between the entropy of the Hubble volume in de Sitter spacetime and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm GH}=A/4G$ associated with the cosmological horizon. In (3+1) spacetime, these two entropies coincide, and hence the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture holds. This provides physical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it is the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we consider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter state in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter thermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\pi$. This temperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local activation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter environment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local temperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. Two different ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were considered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and the first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the entropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon. The original form of the Gibbons-Hawking is valid only for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinct and resolvable signatures compared with Beta/NFW models. These findings deepen our understanding of dark matter halo effects on periodic motions and gravitational wave signatures, providing guidance on future space-based observation for EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large-scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time cosmic acceleration. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, we investigated cosmic magnification beyond weak lensing (incorporating all known relativistic corrections) in beyond-Horndeski gravity$-$with both constant phenomenology and dynamic phenomenology, respectively. For both phenomenologies our results show that the total relativistic signal surpasses cosmic variance (considering an SKA2-like sky coverage) in the magnification angular power spectrum at low redshifts ($z\lesssim 0.5$), hence cosmic-variance reduction methods like multi-tracer analysis will not be needed for surveys at the given $z$. For the individual relativistic signals, we found that the Doppler magnification signal also surpasses cosmic variance and remains the dominant signal, at low $z$, for both phenomenologies. However, the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational (potential) magnification signals, respectively, are subdominant to both the Doppler magnification signal and cosmic variance, at the same $z$; hence multi-tracer analysis will be needed to isolate these signals. At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational magnification signals, respectively, appear to surpass cosmic variance and dominate over the Doppler magnification signal for constant phenomenology; whereas for dynamic phenomenology, all these signals diminish significantly and are well below cosmic variance, at all $z$ (consistent with recent quintessence analysis). Suggesting that including time-variation in the parameters will be crucial in identifying the true signature of the beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points in several cases of interest. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Dark Energy in $F(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We calculate the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can modify the spontaneous emission rate of an excited-state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motions, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and excitation rates; moreover, the corrections caused by the GUP contains the terms proportional to $\beta a^2$ or $\beta a^3$, suggesting that the proper acceleration $a$ of an atom in non-inertial motions could significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.</description>

      <title>Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (4DEGB). We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations-of-state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration, which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, $\alpha$, within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of the constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties. We find that positive values of $\alpha$ support massive stars consistent with the 2\,$M_{\odot}$ constraint and NICER measurements, while negative values, although compatible with low-mass radius observations, fail to reach the observed maximum mass, particularly for EoSs involving phase transitions. Therefore, astrophysical observations may be used to effectively constrain the allowed range of $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

      <title>FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the DE equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by different models through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models (CPL, PADE, GEDE, GDE, BellDE) and their interrelations. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the models parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w &lt; -1\)) around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w &gt; -1\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides competitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the redshift regime $z \sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the viability of DESI and the fast radio burst to constrain the free parameters of modified theories of gravity. Thus, we present a model supported in $f(R)$ gravity involving a function of the Ricci scalar named Starobinsky-type with the peculiarity that the non-commutative essence is intrinsic to the coefficients. Additionally, to understand the dynamics within a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, we explore the possibility of deriving a Friedman equation (in measure) that results from an adequate mathematical treatment. As we mentioned previously, to test the outlined model, a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis is implemented, using cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, Hydrogen II galaxies, Intermediate-luminosity quasars, Baryon Acoustic oscillations and Fast Radio Bursts data, to constraint the free parameters of the model and presenting $H(z)$, $q(z)$ and $\omega_{eff}(z)$. The final results are compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model and a robust discussion is presented about the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters in specific to a modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) framework, originally introduced by Marlan Scully et al. in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115, 8131 (2018), to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23598</link>

Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} &gt; x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal modes in Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes: implications for Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Light Propagation in $\kappa$-Minkowski Space-Time: Gauge Ambiguities and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory on the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time at the semiclassical approximation. We construct exact solutions of the deformed Maxwell equations in vacuum, describing localized signals propagating in a given direction. The propagation velocity appears to be arbitrary. We figure out that the wave packets with different values of the propagation velocity are related by noncommutative gauge transformations. Moreover, we show that spatial distances between particles are gauge-dependent as well. We explain how these two gauge dependencies compensate each other, recovering gauge invariance of measurement results. According to our analysis, the gauge ambiguity of the speed of light can be absorbed into a redefinition of the unit of length and, therefore, cannot be measured experimentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to $\eta/s$ from JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$ result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.</description>
