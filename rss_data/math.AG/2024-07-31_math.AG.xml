      <title>Theorem of Cassels and sums of squares of regular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an irreducible nonsingular curve over a formally real field $K$ and let $f$ be a regular function which is a sum of squares in the ring of regular functions of the surface $C \times \mathbb{A}_K$. We show that the (sum of squares) length of $f$ is the same in the ring of regular functions of $C \times \mathbb{A}_K$ and in the field of rational functions of $C \times \mathbb{A}_K$. With this we are able to show that the Pythagoras number of the ring of regular functions is the same as the Pythagoras number of the field of rational functions, for some product algebraic surfaces. This shows that the Pythagoras number of the ring of regular functions of the real plane is 4, which was not known before.</description>

      <title>Lens spaces as dual complexes of Log Calabi-Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the construction of singular log Calabi-Yau $4$-folds such that the dual complex of the boundary is homeomorphic to a Lens space from a log Calabi-Yau surface with action of a finite cyclic group. We explicitly obtain the Lens spaces $L(3,1)$, $L(5,1)$, and $L(5,2)$ in this way.</description>

      <title>Rank and symmetries of signature tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature of a path is a sequence of tensors which allows to uniquely reconstruct the path. In this paper we propose a systematic study of basic properties of signature tensors, starting from their rank, symmetries and conciseness. We prove a sharp upper bound on the rank of signature tensors of piecewise linear paths. We show that there are no skew-symmetric signature tensors of order three or more, and we also prove that specific instances of partial symmetry can only happen for tensors of order three. Finally, we give a simple geometric characterization of paths whose signature tensors are not concise.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unfolding of singular points of linear differential equations is a classical technique to study the properties of irregular singular points from those of regular singular points. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the unfolding of unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. As one of main results, we give a description for the unfolding of singularities of connections as the deformation of moduli spaces of them, and show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has a deformation to a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we can consider the unfolding of additive Delinge-Simpson problems, namely, the unfolding of irregular singularities generates a family of additive Deligne-Simpson problems. Then as an application of our main result, we show that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities has a solution if and only if every other unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem simultaneously has a solution. Also we give a combinatorial and diagrammatic description of the unfolding of irregular singularities via spectral types and unfolding diagrams, and then consider a conjecture proposed by Oshima which asks the existence of irreducible $G$-connections realizing the given spectral types and their unfolding. Our main result gives an affirmative answer of this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Geometric P=W conjecture in rank 3 on the three-punctured sphere. We describe the topology at infinity of the related character variety. We use asymptotic abelianization of harmonic bundles away from the ramification divisor and an equivariant approach near the branch points to find the WKB (also known as Liouville--Green or phase-integral) expansion of the involved maps. We analyze the Stokes phenomenon governing their behavior.</description>

      <title>Semihomogenous vector bundles, $\mathbb Q$-twisted sheaves, duality, and linear systems on abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we point out the natural relation between $\mathbb Q$-twisted objects of the derived category of abelian varieties, cohomological rank functions, and semihomogeneous vector bundles. We apply this to two basic classes of corresponding objects via the Fourier-Mukai-Poincar\'e transform: positive twists of the ideal sheaf of one point, and evaluation complexes of ample semihomogeneous vector bundles. This leads to $\mathbb Q^{\ge 0}$- graded section modules associated to line bundles on abelian varieties (containing the usual section rings), built by means of semihomogeneous vector bundles. We prove a duality relation between such section modules associated to dual polarizations. Other applications include formulas relating the thresholds of relevant cohomological rank functions appearing in this context. As a consequence we produce non-trivial obstructions to surjectivity of multiplication maps of global sections of certain line bundles.</description>

      <title>Jets-separation thresholds, Seshadri constants and higher Gauss-Wahl maps on abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed subscheme $Z$ of a polarized abelian variety $(A,\ell)$ we define its vanishing threshold with respect to $\ell$ and relate it to the Seshadri constant of the ideal defining $Z.$ As a particular case, we introduce the notion of jets-separation thresholds, which naturally arise as the vanishing threshold of the $p$-infinitesimal neighborhood of a point. Afterwards, by means of Fourier-Mukai methods we relate the jets-separation thresholds with the surjectivity of certain higher Gauss-Wahl maps. As a consequence we obtain a criterion for the surjectivity of those maps in terms of the Seshadri constant of the polarization $\ell.$</description>

      <title>The degeneration of a family of rational surface automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional family of rational surfaces with automorphisms. In a degeneration of this family, the limiting map is the identity map on a special fiber. We check that the map on the total space of the family has indeterminacy in the special fiber. However, we show that after blowing-up at an indeterminate curve, there is an induced birational map on the exceptional divisor over the indeterminate curve. Moreover, we show that this map has dynamical degree 16.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this text we prove that if X is a reduced non-archimedean analytic space and f is a analytic function on a dense Zariski-open subspace of X whose zero-locus is closed in X, then f is a meromorphic function on X. As a corollary, we deduce that every invertible analytic function on the analytification of a reduced scheme of finite type over an affinoid algebra is algebraic.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing of Ceresa and Gross--Kudla--Schoen cycles associated to modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an algebraic curve $X$ of genus $\ge 3$, one can construct two algebraic $1$-cycles, the Ceresa cycle and the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal cycle, each living in the Jacobian of $X$ and the triple product $X \times X \times X$ respectively. These two cycles are homologically trivial but are of infinite order in their corresponding Chow groups for a very general curve over $\mathbb{C}$. From the work of S-W Zhang, for a fixed curve these two cycles are non-torsion in their corresponding Chow groups if and only if one of them is. In this paper, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Kudla-Schoen cycles associated to a modular curve $X$ are non-torsion in the corresponding Chow groups when $X=\Gamma \backslash \overline{\mathbb{H}}$ for certain congruence subgroups $\Gamma\subset {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We obtain the result by studying a pullback formula for special divisors by the diagonal map $X \hookrightarrow X \times X$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</description>

      <title>Global Galois Symbols on E x E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over a number field F, A the abelian surface E x E, and T_F(A) the F-rational albanese kernel of A, which is a subgroup of the degree zero part of Chow group of zero cycles on A modulo rational equivalence. The first result is that for all but a finite number of primes p where E has ordinary reduction, the image of T_F(A)/p in the Galois cohomology group H^2(F, sym^2(E[p])) is zero; here E[p] denotes as usual the Galois module of p-division points on E. The second result is that for any prime p where E has good ordinary reduction, there is a finite extension K of F, depending on p and E, such that T_K(A)/p is non-zero.
  Much of this work was joint with Jacob Murre, and the article is dedicated to his memory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Langlands for Irregular Theta Connections and Epipelagic Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a stable vector of a stable grading on a simple Lie algebra, Yun defined a rigid automorphic datum that encodes a epipelagic representation, and also an irregular connection on the projective line called $\theta$-connection. We show that under geometric Langlands correspondence, $\theta$-connection corresponds to the Hecke eigensheaf attached the rigid automorphic datum, assuming the stable grading is inner and its Kac coordinate $s_0$ is positive. We provide numerous applications of the main result including physical and cohomological rigidity of $\theta$-connections, global oper structures, and a de Rham analog of Reeder-Yu's predictions on epipelagic Langlands parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</description>

Abstract: Kontsevich and Soibelman constructed integral affine manifolds with singularities (IAMS, for short) for maximal degenerations of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds in a non-Archimedean way. On the other hand, for each maximally degenerating family of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds, we can consider the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the fibers. It is expected that this Gromov-Hausdorff limit carries an IAMS-structure. Kontsevich and Soibelman conjectured that these two types of IAMS are the same. This conjecture is believed in the mirror symmetry context. In this paper, we prove the above conjecture for maximal degenerations of polarized Kummer surfaces.</description>

Abstract: A Richelot isogeny between Jacobian varieties is an isogeny whose kernel is included in the $2$-torsion subgroup of the domain. A Richelot isogeny whose codomain is the product of two or more principally polarized abelian varieties is called a decomposed Richelot isogeny.
  In this paper, we develop some explicit arithmetic on curves of genus $3$, including algorithms to compute the codomain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny. As solutions to compute the domain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny, explicit formulae of defining equations for Howe curves of genus $3$ are also given. Using the formulae, we shall construct an algorithm with complexity $\tilde{O}(p^3)$ (resp. $\tilde{O}(p^4)$) to enumerate all hyperelliptic (resp. non-hyperelliptic) superspecial Howe curves of genus $3$.</description>

Abstract: We state results from noncommutative deformation theory of modules over an associative $k$-algebra $A,$ $k$ a field, necessary for this work. We define a set of $A$-modules $\operatorname{aSpec}A$ containing the simple modules, whose elements we call spectral, for which there exists a topology where the simple modules are the closed points. Applying results from deformation theory we prove that there exists a sheaf of associative rings $\mathcal O_X$ on the topological space $X=\operatorname{aSpec}A$ giving it the structure of a pointed ringed space. In general, an associative variety $X$ is a ringed space with an open covering $\{U_i=\operatorname{aSpec}{A_i}\}_{i\in I}.$ When $A$ is a commutative $k$-algebra, $\operatorname{aSpec}A\simeq\spec A,$ and so the category $\cat{aVar}_k$ of associative varieties is an extension of the category of varieties $\cat{Var}_k,$ i.e. there exists a faithfully full functor $I:\cat{Var}_k\rightarrow\cat{aVar}_k.$ Our main result says that any associative variety $X$ is $\operatorname{aSpec}(\mathcal O_X(X))$ for the $k$-algebra $\mathcal O_X(X),$ and so any study of varieties can be reduced to the study of the associative algebra $\mathcal O_X(X).$</description>

We address the general problem of determining which among them are non-normal subvarieties of the moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this text, we wish to provide the reader with a short guide to recent works on the theory of dilatations in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. These works fall naturally into two categories: one emphasises foundational and theoretical aspects and the other applications to existing theories.</description>

      <title>On ordinary differentially large fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of differentially large fields in arbitrary characteristic and a single derivation in the spirit of Blum axioms for differentially closed fields. In the case of characteristic zero, we use these axioms to characterise differential largeness in terms of being existentially closed in the differential algebraic Laurent series ring, and we prove that any large field of infinite transcendence degree can be expanded to a differentially large field even under certain prescribed constant fields. As an application, we show that the theory of proper dense pairs of models of a complete and modelcomplete theory of large fields, is a complete theory. As a further consequence of the expansion result we show that there is no real closed and differential field that has a prime model extension in closed ordered differential fields, unless it is itself a closed ordered differential field.</description>

      <title>On embedding of linear hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear hypersurfaces over a field $k$ have been playing a central role in the study of some of the challenging problems on affine spaces. Breakthroughs on such problems have occurred by examining two difficult questions on linear polynomials of the form $H:=\alpha(X_1,\dots,X_m)Y - F(X_1,\dots, X_m,Z,T)\in D:=k[X_1,\ldots,X_m, Y,Z,T]$:
  (i) Whether $H$ defines a closed embedding of $\mathbb{A}^{m+2}$ into $\mathbb{A}^{m+3}$, i.e., whether the affine variety $\mathbb{V}\subseteq \mathbb{A}^{m+3}_k$ defined by $H$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^{m+2}_k$.
  (ii) If $H$ defines a closed embedding $\mathbb{A}^{m+2}\hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}^{m+3}$ then whether $H$ is a coordinate in $D$.
  Question (i) connects to the Characterization Problem of identifying affine spaces among affine varieties; Question (ii) is a special case of the formidable Embedding Problem for affine spaces. In their earlier work the first two authors had addressed these questions when $\alpha$ is a monomial of the form $\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_m) = X_1^{r_1}\dots X_m^{r_m}$; $r_i&gt;1, 1 \leqslant i \leqslant m$ and $F$ is of a certain type. In this paper, using $K$-theory and $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions, we address these questions for a wider family of linear varieties. In particular, we obtain certain families of higher dimensional hyperplanes $H$ satisfying the Abhyankar Sathaye conjecture on the Embedding problem. For instance, we show that when the characteristic of $k$ is zero, $F \in k[Z,T]$ and $H$ defines a hyperplane, then $H$ is a coordinate in $D$ along with $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$. Our results in arbitrary characteristic yield counterexamples to the Zariski Cancellation Problem in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Singular loci of Schubert varieties and the Lookup Conjecture in type $\tilde A_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the loci of non-rationally smooth (nrs) points and of singular points for any non-spiral Schubert variety of $\tilde{A}_2$ in terms of the geometry of the (affine) Weyl group action on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Together with the results of Graham and Li for spiral elements, this allows us to explicitly identify the maximal singular and nrs points in any Schubert variety of type $\tilde{A}_2$. Comparable results are not known for any other infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody flag variety (except for type $\tilde{A}_1$, where every Schubert variety is rationally smooth). As a consequence, we deduce that if $x$ is a point in a non-spiral Schubert variety $X_w$, then $x$ is nrs in $X_w$ if and only if there are more than $\dim X_w$ curves in $X_w$ through $x$ which are stable under the action of a maximal torus, as is true for Schubert varieties in (finite) type $A$. Combined with the work of Graham and Li for spiral Schubert varieties, this implies the Lookup Conjecture for $\tilde{A}_2$.</description>

      <title>Syzygies of general projections of canonical and paracanonical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^r$ be an integral linearly normal variety and $R=k[x_0,\cdots,x_r]$ the coordinate ring of $\mathbb{P}^r$. It is known that the syzygies of $X$ contain some geometric information. In recent years the syzygies of non-projectively normal varieties or in other words, the projection $X'$ of $X$ away from a linear subspace $W\subset\mathbb{P}^r$, were taken into considerations. Assuming that the coordinate ring of the ambient space that $X'$ lives in is $S$, there are two types of vanishing properties of the Betti diagrams of the projected varieties, the so-called $N_{d,p}^S$ and $\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$. The former one have been widely discussed for general varieties, for example by S. Kwak, Y. Choi and E. Park, while the latter one was discussed by W. Lee and E. Park for curves of very large degree.
  In this paper I will discuss about the $\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$ properties of the projection of a generic canonical and paracanonical curve away from a generic point and in particular whether they are cut out by quadrics. Some conjectures will be claimed based on the tests on Macaulay2.</description>

      <title>Coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties and automorphic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.12056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the cohomology of canonical extensions of automorphic vector bundles over toroidal compactifications of Shimura varieties can be computed by relative Lie algebra cohomology of automorphic forms. Our result is inspired by and parallel to Borel and Franke's work on the cohomology of automorphic local systems on locally symmetric spaces, and also generalizes a theorem of Mumford.</description>

      <title>A universal formula for the $x-y$ swap in topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of Borot et al. that a particular universal closed algebraic formula recovers the correlation differentials of topological recursion after the swap of $x$ and $y$ in the input data. We also show that this universal formula can be drastically simplified (as it was already done by Hock).
  As an application of this general $x-y$ swap result, we prove an explicit closed formula for the topological recursion differentials for the case of any spectral curve with unramified $y$ and arbitrary rational $x$.</description>

      <title>Uniform extension of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that definable Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer and $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity, are the restrictions of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-functions; "definable" refers to an arbitrary given o-minimal expansion of the real field. This is true in a uniform way: any definable bounded family of Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$ extends to a definable bounded family of $C^{m,\omega}$-functions. We also discuss a uniform $C^m$-version and how the extension depends on the modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Simple tilts of length hearts and simple-minded mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise when a simple Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilt of a length heart is again a length heart in terms of approximation theory and the existence of a stability condition with a phase gap. We apply simple-minded reduction to provide a sufficient condition for infinite iterability of simple-minded mutation/simple tilting. We use simple-minded mutation pairs to provide a common framework to show that mutation of simple-minded collections (resp. $w$-simple-minded systems, for $w \geq 1$) gives simple-minded collections (resp. $w$-simple-minded systems) under mild conditions, in the process providing a unified proof of results of A. Dugas and P. Jorgensen. Finally, we show that under mild conditions, mutation of simple-minded collections is compatible with mutation of $w$-simple-minded systems via a singularity category construction due to H. Jin.</description>
