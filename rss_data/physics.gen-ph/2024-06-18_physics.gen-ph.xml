      <title>Intersubjectivity and value reproducibility of outcomes of quantum measurements</title>

Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic duos: the building blocks of dimensional mechanics</title>

Abstract: Mechanics studies the relationships between space, time, and matter, which can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of length $\mathcal{L}$, time $\mathcal{T}$, and mass $\mathcal{M}$. Each dimension broadens the scope of mechanics, from geometric quantities with dimensions of the form $\mathcal{L}^x$ (like lengths or areas), to kinematic quantities of the form $\mathcal{L}^x\mathcal{T}^y$ (like speeds or accelerations), and eventually ``mass-carrying'' quantities such as mass, force, momentum, energy, action, power, viscosity, etc. These standard mechanical quantities have dimensions of the form $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{L}^x\mathcal{T}^y$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. In this contribution, we use this dimensional structure to arrange these mass-carrying quantities into a table indexed by $x$ and $y$. Ratios of quantities in the same rows provide characteristic lengths, and in the same columns characteristic times, encompassing a great variety of physical phenomena from atomic to astronomical scales. Most generally, we show that picking duos of mechanical quantities that are neither on the same row nor column yields dynamics, where one mechanical quantity is understood as impelling motion, while the other is impeding it. The force and the mass are the prototypes of impelling and impeding factors, but many other duos are possible. This review provides a novel synthesis revealing the power of dimensional analysis, to understand processes governed by the interplay of two mechanical quantities. This elementary decomposition of space, time and motion into pairs of mechanical factors is the foundation of ``dimensional mechanics'', a method that this review wishes to promote and advance. The review is complemented by online video lectures, which initiate a discussion on the elaborate interplay of two or more mechanical quantities.</description>
