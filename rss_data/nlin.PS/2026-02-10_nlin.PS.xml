      <title>Stretched-Exponential Aging Governs Nonequilibrium Precipitate Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized growth in driven materials is often governed by intermittent failure, yet how a material's history biases failure sites remains poorly understood. Using pause-restart experiments on chemical precipitate membranes, we quantify the probability of age-dependent breaching. We show that the kinetics follow a stretched-exponential aging law with parameters that obey one-parameter scaling. As the system approaches a critical concentration, the stretching exponent $\beta$ tends to zero, signaling a crossover to scale-free, power-law behavior. A stochastic cellular automaton based on this aging rule reproduces the emergent filaments and their concentration-dependent thickening. Our findings identify aging-controlled failure with long-lived but decaying memory as a general route to pattern formation in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Breathers in a Honeycomb Lattice Near a Semi-Dirac Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of discrete breathers -- spatially localized and time-periodic solutions -- inside the bandgap of a nonlinear honeycomb lattice where the dispersion landscape approaches a so-called semi-Dirac point in which the bands cross linearly in one direction and quadratically in the orthogonal direction. By studying breather dynamics in two opposing asymptotic regimes, near the continuum and anti-continuum limits, we capture the features of hybrid coherent structures on the lattice that are highly discrete at the breather's central peak and have tails well approximated by exact separable solutions to an effective long-wave PDE theory at spatial infinity. We find that breathers are dynamically stable over a wide range of parameters and locate an instability transition. Finally, we analyze the Floquet stability of spatially extended nonlinear plane waves bifurcating from the zero solution at the edges of the gap and how they shape breather profiles inside the gap.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled elastic, inelastic, and coalescent collisions of two-dimensional flat-top solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate elastic, inelastic, and coalescent collisions between two-dimensional flat-top solitons supported by the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal distinct collision regimes ranging from nearly elastic scattering to strongly inelastic interactions leading to long-lived merged states. We demonstrate that the transition between these regimes is primarily controlled by the relative phase of the solitons at the collision point, with out-of-phase collisions suppressing overlap and in-phase collisions promoting strong interaction. Kinetic-energy diagnostics are introduced to quantitatively characterize collision outcomes and to identify phase- and separation-dependent windows of elasticity. To interpret the observed dynamics, we extract effective phase-dependent interaction potentials from collision trajectories, providing a mechanical picture of attraction and repulsion between flat-top solitons. The stability of merged states formed after strongly inelastic collisions is explained by their lower energetic cost, arising from interfacial energetics, where a balance between internal pressure and edge tension plays a central role. A variational analysis based on direct energy minimization supports this picture by revealing robust energetic minima associated with stationary two-dimensional flat-top solitons.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of bound states in expulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schr\"{o}dinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Excitable Neuronal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.</description>
