      <title>On the Yang-Mills propagator at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About twelve years ago the use of standard functional manipulations was demonstrated to imply an unexpected property satisfied by the fermionic Green's functions of QCD. This non-perturbative phenomenon is dubbed Effective Locality. In a much simpler way than in QCD, the most remarkable and intriguing aspects of Effective Locality have been presented in a recent letter in the Yang-Mills theory on Minkowski spacetime. While quickly recalled in the current paper, these results are used to calculate the problematic gluonic propagator in the Yang-Mills non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive Entropy and Holographic Thermodynamics: Topological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the thermodynamic topology of AdS Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes, employing non-extensive entropy formulations such as Barrow, R\'enyi, and Sharma-Mittal entropy within two distinct frameworks: bulk boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics. Our findings reveal that in the bulk boundary framework, the topological charges, are influenced by the free parameters and the Barrow non-extensive parameter $(\delta)$. So, we faced three topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$. When the parameter $\delta$ increases to 0.9, the classification changes, resulting in two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$. When $\delta$ is set to zero, the equations reduce to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy structure, yielding consistent results with three topological charges. Additionally, setting the non-extensive parameter $\lambda$ in R\'enyi entropy to zero increases the number of topological charges, but the total topological charge remains (W = +1). The presence of the R\'enyi non-extensive parameter alters the topological behavior compared to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Sharma-Mittal entropy shows different classifications and the various numbers of topological charges influenced by the non-extensive parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. When $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have values close to each other, three topological charges with a total topological charge $(W = +1)$ are observed. Varying one parameter while keeping the other constant significantly changes the topological classification and number of topological charges. In contrast, the RPS framework demonstrates remarkable consistency in topological behavior. Under all conditions and for all free parameters, the topological charge remains $(\omega = +1)$ with the total topological charge $(W = +1)$. This uniformity persists even when reduced to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology and Phase Space Analysis of AdS Black Holes Through Non-Extensive Entropy Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the thermodynamic topology through the bulk-boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) frameworks. In bulk-boundary framework, we observe two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$ concerning the non-extensive Barrow parameter and with ($\delta=0$) in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For Renyi entropy, different topological charges are observed depending on the value of the $\lambda$ with a notable transition from three topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$ to a single topological charge $(\omega = +1)$ as $\lambda$ increases. Also, by setting $\lambda$ to zero results in two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$. Sharma-Mittal entropy exhibits three distinct ranges of topological charges influenced by the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with different classifications viz $\beta$ exceeds $\alpha$, we will have $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$, $\beta = \alpha$, we have $(\omega = +1, -1)$ and for $\alpha$ exceeds $\beta$ we face $(\omega = -1)$. Also, Kaniadakis entropy shows variations in topological charges viz we observe $(\omega = +1, -1)$ for any acceptable value of $K$, except when $K = 0$, where a single topological charge $(\omega = -1)$. In the case of Tsallis-Cirto entropy, for small parameter $\Delta$ values, we have $(\omega = +1)$ and when $\Delta$ increases to 0.9, we will have $(\omega = +1, -1)$. When we extend our analysis to the RPS framework, we find that the topological charge consistently remains $(\omega = +1)$ independent of the specific values of the free parameters for Renyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Tsallis-Cirto. Additionally, for Barrow entropy in RPS, the number of topological charges rises when $\delta$ increases from 0 to 0.8. Finally for Kaniadakis entropy, at small values of $K$, we observe $(\omega = +1)$. However, as the non-extensive parameter $K$ increases, we encounter different topological charges and classifications with $(\omega = +1, -1)$.</description>

      <title>1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Field Redefinitions Can Be Nonlocal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the lore establishing the allowed space of field redefinitions and show that there are essentially no restrictions. Our conclusions hold to all orders in perturbation theory and for any dispersion relation. Field redefinitions can be nonlocal, symmetry breaking, or have explicit dependence on spacetime. We address field redefinitions that can be resummed into the propagator, which demonstrates how to perform perturbative calculations away from the minimum in field space. Field redefinitions are used to derive higher-order Schwinger-Dyson equations, which imply multiparticle soft theorems. Non-standard field redefinitions are showcased using both relativistic and nonrelativistic examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of 5d Supergravity Theories and the Emergent String Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We invoke probe brane arguments to classify the asymptotic behavior of general five-dimensional supergravity theories with eight supercharges near infinite distance boundaries of the vector multiplet moduli space. Imposing consistency of supergravity strings we derive several constraints on the Chern-Simons couplings entering the prepotential, including their non-negativity. This establishes a classification of infinite distance limits analogous to those for theories obtained as Calabi-Yau compactifications, but without having to assume a geometric or string theoretic origin. All infinite distance limits are found to be either vector or tensor limits, depending on the nature of the gauge potential becoming weakly coupled at the fastest rate. In particular, we prove uniqueness results for the asymptotically leading gauge fields. The asymptotic physics along these limits is in perfect agreement with the predictions of the Emergent String Conjecture and hence serves as bottom-up evidence for the latter. Our findings imply that every consistent five-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity with a non-compact vector multiplet moduli space either descends from six dimensions or contains a stringy subsector.</description>

      <title>Uplifts in the Penumbra: Features of the Moduli Potential away from Infinite-Distance Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of meta-stable four-dimensional de Sitter vacua in type IIB string compactifications represents an important question and an ongoing area of work. There is considerable support both for stringy de Sitter vacua in the interior of moduli space and for their scarceness in the strict asymptotic regime towards infinite-distance boundaries of the compactification moduli space. Here, we present evidence for the existence of uplifting vacua in the three-form flux-induced scalar potential of the complex structure moduli of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds in the cross-over region between the interior of the moduli space and its strictly asymptotic infinite-distance regions. Moreover, we also exhibit the existence of long-range axion valleys which, while not yet supporting slow-roll inflation, do show a flattened scalar potential from complex structure moduli backreaction and axion monodromy. We further illustrate how such regions hosting axion valleys may be obtained by using machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fermion Cartography: from confinement and chiral symmetry breaking to conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the interplay between colour-confining and chiral symmetry-breaking dynamics in gauge-fermion systems with a general number of flavours and colours. Specifically, we work out the flavour dependence of the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scales. We connect the QCD-like regime, in quantitative agreement with lattice data, with the perturbative conformal limit, thereby exploring uncharted region of theory space. This analysis is done within the first-principles functional renormalisation group approach to gauge-fermion systems and is facilitated by a novel approximation scheme introduced here. This novel scheme enables a relatively simple access to the confining dynamics. This allows us to investigate the whole landscape of many-flavour theories and to provide a cartography of their phase structure. In particular, we uncover a novel phase with the locking of confining and chiral dynamics at intermediate flavour numbers. We also explore the close-conformal region that displays a walking behaviour. Finally, we provide a quantitative estimate for the lower boundary of the conformal Caswell-Banks-Zaks window, with a $N^{\rm crit}_f(N_c=3)= 9.60^{+0.55}_{-0.53}$. This work offers a self-consistent framework for charting the landscape of strongly interacting gauge-fermion theories necessary to reliably study strongly coupled extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a $4$-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ integrable quiver in massive type IIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are examining a newly discovered parametric family of backgrounds in massive type IIA supergravity that contains a warped $\text{AdS}_5$ factor. This family is the dual gravity description of $4$-dimensional quivers with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We are interested in the status of classical integrability in these theories and we show that there exists a single choice of solutions that is special, while all other choices lead to non-integrable quivers and chaotic string motion. By focusing on this special choice we provide strong suggestive evidence for the integrability of the dual field theory based on analytic studies and extensive numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the $\eta$ regularisation scheme in order to develop a framework for systematically studying regularisation of loops in quantum field theory. This allows us to "solve" a set of gauge consistency conditions for families of gauge invariant regularisation schemes. We recover several known examples such as dimensional and denominator regularisations, as well as some more general solutions. We also study anomalies in chiral theories in order to carefully describe how our formalism should be properly implemented.</description>

      <title>Mass and Force Relations for Extremal EMDA Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate various properties of extremal dyonic static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. We obtain a simple first-order ordinary differential equation for the black hole mass in terms of its electric and magnetic charges, which we can solve explicitly for certain special values of the scalar couplings. For one such case we also construct new dyonic black hole solutions, making use of the presence of an enhanced SL(2,R) symmetry. Finally, we investigate the structure of long range forces and binding energies between non-equivalent extremal black holes. For certain special cases, we can identify regions of parameter space where the force is always attractive or repulsive. Unlike in the case without an axion, the force and binding energies between distinct black holes are not always correlated with each other. Our work is motivated in part by the question of whether long range forces between non-identical states can potentially encode information about UV constraints on low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>An Open Effective Field Theory for light in a medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of multi-twist operators in general CFTs, we study the leading-twist states of the $N$-body problem in AdS at large spin $J$. We find that for the majority of states the effective quantum-mechanical problem becomes semiclassical with $\hbar=1/J$. The classical system at $J=\infty$ has $N-2$ degrees of freedom, and the classical phase space is identified with the positive Grassmanian $\mathrm{Gr}_{+}(2,N)$. The quantum problem is recovered via a Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a classical Hamiltonian, which we describe explicitly. For $N=3$ the classical system has one degree of freedom and a detailed structure of the spectrum can be obtained from Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. For all $N$, we show that the lowest excited states are approximated by a harmonic oscillator and find explicit expressions for their energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate canonically quantized open string solutions associated to the analytically continued action for the recently proposed tropical limit of topological A-type models, tropological sigma models, with various boundary conditions. These solutions naturally give rise to a non-relativistic counterpart of branes, which we name tropical branes. We provide a preliminary worldsheet description of these tropical branes, laying the groundwork for an upcoming paper that will explore the role of tropical branes in the context of brane quantization.</description>

      <title>Exact charged and rotating toroidal black hole in the Einstein $SU(N)$-Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an exact solution of the Einstein $SU(N)$-Skyrme model in $D=4$ space-time dimensions describing a charged and rotating black hole with toroidal horizon. Rotation is added by applying an improper coordinate transformation to the known static toroidal black hole with Skyrme hair, while the electric charge is supplemented by considering a $U(1)$ gauge field interacting with Einstein gravity. We perform the thermal analysis in the grand canonical ensemble, explicitly showing the role that the flavor number plays. Some discussions about stability are also considered.</description>

      <title>Instability in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium states of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be characterized by the temperature and three chemical potentials, corresponding to the ${\rm U}(1)^3$ subgroup of the $R$-symmetry group. We investigate the phase diagram of the theory at strong coupling, in the grand canonical ensemble in flat space, using its holographic description via the five-dimensional model of Behrnd, Cveti\v{c}, and Sabra. The bulk action includes the metric, three Abelian gauge fields, and two neutral scalar fields. The equilibrium state described by the charged black brane is always thermodynamically unstable at low temperature. Relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple conserved charges predicts that thermodynamic instability is accompanied by a dynamical instability, with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the corresponding Hessian playing a key role in identifying the unstable modes. We explicitly demonstrate this for three equal chemical potentials, finding unstable quasinormal modes that describe $R$-charge diffusion. Consequently, the low-temperature phase of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with equal chemical potentials is not described by the AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane.</description>

      <title>Lovelock type brane gravity from a minimal surface perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the correspondence between the parallel surfaces framework, and the minimal surfaces framework, to uncover and apply new aspects of the geometrical and mechanical content behind the so-called Lovelock-type brane gravity (LBG). We show how this type of brane gravity emerges naturally from a Dirac-Nambu-Goto (DNG) action functional built up from the volume element associated with a world volume shifted a distance $\alpha$ along the normal vector of a germinal world volume, and provide all known geometric structures for such a theory. Our development highlights the dependence of the geometry for the displaced world volume on the fundamental forms, as well as on certain conserved tensors, defined on the outset world volume. Based on this, LBG represents a natural and elegant generalization of the DNG theory to higher dimensions. Moreover, our development allows for exploring disformal transformations in Lovelock brane gravity and analyzing their relations with scalar-tensor theories defined on the brane trajectory. Likewise, this geometrical correspondence would enable us to establish contact with tractable Hamiltonian approximations for this brane gravity theory, by exploiting the linkage with a DNG model, and thus start building a suitable quantum version.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantizing Null p-branes: Light-Cone Gauge Analysis and Physical Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study null $p$-branes, $p$-branes with a Carrollian $p+1$-dimensional worldvolume embedded in a generic $D$-dimensional flat Minkowski target space. This theory has a generalized BMS$_{p+1}$ gauge symmetry. By fixing the light-cone gauge, the BMS symmetry is partly fixed, leaving $p$ ``momentum constraints'' alongside $p$-dimensional area-preserving diffeomorphisms. We quantize the theory in the light-cone gauge via canonical quantization and construct the physical Hilbert space by imposing the remaining constraints using sandwich conditions: the constraints must vanish when sandwiched between any two physical states. We show that solutions to the sandwich conditions are classified into $p+1$ distinct classes, which we completely specify. In addition, we discuss special and interesting case of membranes in four dimensions and examine the physical implications of the quantized null $p$-brane and its associated physical Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of non-invertible flavor symmetries in intersecting/magnetized D-brane models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss selection rules of chiral matters in type IIA intersecting and IIB magnetized D-brane models on toroidal orbifolds. Since the chiral matters on toroidal orbifolds are labeled by a certain conjugacy class of the gauged orbifold group, the selection rules involve non-trivial fusion rules. We find that the representation of the chiral matters is described by a $D_4$ flavor symmetry for an even number of magnetic fluxes or winding numbers at tree level. Furthermore, the $D_4$ symmetry still remains even when we take into account loop effects. We also study non-perturbative effects such as D-brane instantons.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires that the same entanglement generation occurs for either an act of measurement or particle interaction. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. The language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. Unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and another entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Exact g-function without strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to compute exact $g$-function for integrable quantum field theories with non-diagonal scattering S-matrices. The approach is based on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The exact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of the integrable boundary state and the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe ansatz. In the continuum limit, after subtracting the contribution proportional to the volume of the closed channel, we obtain the exact $g$-function, given in terms of the counting function which is the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. The resulting $g$-function contains two parts, the scalar part, which depends on the boundary parameters and the ratio of Fredholm determinants, which is universal. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with magnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the exact $g$-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory with various integrable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the Celestial Supersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the celestial CFT dual to theories with bulk supersymmetry. The boundary theory realizes supersymmetry in the spirit of the Green-Schwarz superstring: there is manifest 4d super-Poincar\'e symmetry, but no 2d superconformal symmetry. Nevertheless, we can extend the celestial sphere itself to a supermanifold -- the celestial supersphere. This provides a unified framework for describing key features of celestial holography, including conformally soft theorems, OPEs, and chiral soft algebras. Using these tools, we demonstrate that the $\frak{bms}_{4}$ algebra extends to a novel $\frak{sbms}_{4|\mathcal{N}}$ algebra. We also relate the supersymmetric $L(w_{1+\infty}^\wedge)$ algebra to Hamiltonian vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$, consistent with the expectation from twistor theory, and deduce the deformation of this algebra by a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. These results are all universal and independent of the specific details of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>On the Field Theoretical Description of an Alternative Model to Generalized Chaplygin Gas and its Thermodynamic Behaviour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to study a newly proposed fluid description of dark energy in the context of late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We examine the probable origin of the proposed equation of state in correspondence with some vastly discussed scalar field models of dark energy and reconstruct the field parameters like scalar field $\phi$ and scalar potential $V(\phi)$, analyzing their behavior in the evolution of the universe. The study also incorporates an analysis of fundamental energy conditions: Null Energy Condition (NEC), Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC), to assess the physical consistency and cosmological implications of the model. We perform a detailed stability analysis and investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the proposed fluid model from a thermodynamic perspective. Additionally, the model is analyzed using some of the latest observational datasets, such as Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Supernova Type-Ia (using Pantheon+SH0ES compilation and Union 2.1), to determine its viability and consistency with observations. The results suggest that the model offers a robust description of dark energy dynamics while maintaining agreement with current observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, as a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. In order to constrain the parameter space of the model, the $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraint of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 data as well as the reheating parameters such as the duration $N_{\rm{re}}$, the temperature $T_{\rm{re}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, are employed. In addition, a model independent bound on the duration of the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$ is applied to improve the parameter space. Furthermore, the density spectra of relic gravitational waves (GWs) in light of the sensitivity domains of GW detectors, for specific inflationary durations $N$, are analyzed. Finally, by combining constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), reheating, RD era, and relic GWs, the permissible inflationary duration is constrained to $46\leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1\leq N\leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161\leq\alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217\leq\alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL).</description>

      <title>Stability of Superconducting Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of superconducting strings as bound states of strings and fermion zero modes at both the classical and quantum levels. The dynamics of these superconducting strings can result in a stable configuration, known as a vorton. We mainly focus on global strings, but the majority of the discussion can be applied to local strings. Using lattice simulations, we study the classical dynamics of superconducting strings and confirm that they relax to the vorton configuration through Nambu-Goldstone boson radiation, with no evidence of over-shooting that would destabilize the vorton. We explore the tunneling of fermion zero modes out of the strings. Both our classical analysis and quantum calculations yield consistent results: the maximum energy of the zero mode significantly exceeds the fermion mass, in contrast to previous literature. Additionally, we introduce a world-sheet formalism to evaluate the decay rate of zero modes into other particles, which constitute the dominant decay channel. We also identify additional processes that trigger zero-mode decay due to non-adiabatic changes of the string configuration. In these decay processes, the rates are suppressed by the curvature of string loops, with exponential suppression for large masses of the final states. We further study the scattering with light charged particles surrounding the string core produced by the zero-mode current and find that a wide zero-mode wavefunction can enhance vorton stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A favored scenario for axions to be dark matter is for them to form a cosmic string network that subsequently decays, allowing for a tight link between the axion mass and relic abundance. We discuss an example in which the axion is protected from quantum gravity effects that would spoil its ability to solve the strong CP problem: namely a string theoretic axion arising from gauge symmetry in warped extra dimensions. Axion strings arise following the first-order Randall-Sundrum compactification phase transition, forming at the junctions of three bubbles during percolation. Their tensions are at the low scale associated with the warp factor, and are parametrically smaller than the usual field-theory axion strings, relative to the scale of their decay constant. Simulations of string network formation by this mechanism must be carried out to see whether the axion mass-relic density relation depends on the new parameters in the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional methods can be applied to the quantum effective action to efficiently determine counterterms and matching conditions for effective field theories. We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational memory, which describes the permanent shift in the strain after the passage of gravitational waves, is directly related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry group of asymptotically flat space-times. In this work, we provide an equivalent description of the phenomenon in local coordinates around gravitational wave detectors, such as transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. We show that gravitational memory is encoded in large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, which include time-dependent anisotropic spatial rescalings, and prove their equivalence to BMS transformations when translated to TT gauge. We then derive the associated Ward identities and associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, and explicitly check their validity for planar gravitational waves. The in-in identities are recognized as the flat space analogue of the well-known inflationary consistency relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized generically with low-energy new physics without supersymmetry while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable benchmark models, the scalar has a mass of ${\cal O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across multiple frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <title>The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Atoms and Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The system is also known as a gravitational atom, due to its similarities with the hydrogen atom. The thesis focuses on a scenario where a gravitational atom is orbited by a binary companion. The goal is to characterize the dynamics of the system and identify the signatures left by the boson cloud on the gravitational waves emitted by the binary. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope and TianQin. First, I demonstrate that the cloud catalyzes the binary formation by increasing the dynamical capture cross section. I then introduce and study the ionization of the cloud, wherein the perturbation from the binary unbinds the bosons, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. After that, I examine the accretion of the cloud on the companion black hole. To achieve realistic and complete results, I proceed to extend the treatment of ionization, as well as of the orbital resonances discussed in earlier works, to orbits with generic inclination and eccentricity. This allows to study the entire history of the system, from formation to merger. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are found to be the orbital energy lost through ionization and the preference for specific inclinations and eccentricities induced by the orbital resonances.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a Galilean quantum Hall crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic effective field theory for Galilean-invariant quantum Hall systems with spontaneously broken translational symmetry. Neglecting the role of energy conservation in a low-temperature regime, the hydrodynamic mode is a magnetophonon with quartic attenuation: $\omega\sim \pm k^2-\mathrm{i} k^z$ with $z=4$. However, this linear response theory is unstable, and flows to a non-trivial dynamical universality class with $z\approx 3$. We observe this scaling in numerical simulations of many-body classical Hamiltonian dynamics, in a model of an electronic crystal in the lowest Landau level. Observing this magnetophonon decay rate in a quantum Hall crystal represents a promising setting to detect an analogue of a "fractonic dynamical universality class" in a solid-state system, e.g. using microwave impedance microscopy.</description>

      <title>Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study slow roll inflation and the generation of primordial density fluctuations within the context of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. We consider the slow roll approximation in the modified Friedmann equations within the $f(Q,T)$ gravity, specifically in the form $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+g(T)$, where $g(T)$ is an arbitrary function of the trace of stress energy tensor $T$. Subsequently, we derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations for both scalar and tensor perturbations. By solving these equations in the slow-roll regime, we calculate the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes within the $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+g(T)$ model. In particular, we examine two distinct functional forms of $g(T)$ to calculate the slow roll parameters, the scalar spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio. By imposing constraints on the parameters of the model, we achieve results that align well with the Planck 2018 data. Interestingly, a model including a $T^2$ dependence showed good agreement with the observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to numerically compute scattering cross sections in QCD, one needs to deal with various kinematic divergences that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation. One way of doing this is by setting up an IR subtraction scheme. In this talk we give an update on the status of extending the CoLoRFul subtraction scheme, which has been successfully used in the past for processes with only final-state hadrons, to hadron-hadron collisions. In particular we discuss the analytic computation of the integrated counterterms.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum fate of the classical singularities that occur by gravitational collapse of a dust cloud. For this purpose, we address the quantization of a model first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1933. We find that the singularities can generically be avoided. This is a consequence of unitary evolution in the quantum theory, whereby the quantum dust cloud collapses, bounces at a minimal radius and re-expands.</description>

      <title>DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiFfRG (Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows), a comprehensive computational C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows in very general truncation schemes. Its central features are threefold: Firstly, the use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and quantitatively reliable computations of field dependences. Secondly, the (simultaneous) setup of large, fully momentum-dependent vertex expansions. Thirdly, efficient time-discretisation methods, incorporating insights from studies of solving theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, going hand in hand with shocks and an exponential increase of the information flow velocity in field space. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFfRG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included: finite temperature O(N) theory, a Quark-Meson model, SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and four-Fermi flows in the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario of a single Majorana particle in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ $\textit{and nothing else}$. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of BPS Moduli Spaces and Asymptotics of Supersymmetric Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01538v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prototype for Wilsonian analysis of asymptotics of supersymmetric partition functions of non-abelian gauge theories. Localization allows expressing such partition functions as an integral over a BPS moduli space. When the limit of interest introduces a scale hierarchy in the problem, asymptotics of the partition function is obtained in the Wilsonian approach by $i)$ decomposing (in some suitable scheme) the BPS moduli space into various patches according to the set of light fields (lighter than the scheme dependent cut-off $\Lambda$) they support, $ii)$ localizing the partition function of the effective field theory on each patch (with cut-offs set by the scheme), and $iii)$ summing up the contributions of all patches to obtain the final asymptotic result (which is scheme-independent and accurate as $\Lambda\to\infty$). Our prototype concerns the Cardy-like asymptotics of the 4d superconformal index, which has been of interest recently for its application to black hole microstate counting in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain the most general asymptotic expression for the index of gauge theories in the Cardy-like limit, encompassing and extending all previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCNR) was recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{Yin:2022toc} as a measure of multipartite entanglement in a condensed matter context. In this short note, we point out that it is closely related to the $(2,n)$-R\'enyi reflected entropy, which has been studied in the context of AdS/CFT. We discuss the calculation of the CCNR in random tensor networks as well as holographic CFTs. The holographic dual involves a backreacted entanglement wedge cross section in a geometry sourced by R\'enyi-2 cosmic branes. We perform explicit calculations for two intervals in a hyperbolic random tensor network as well the vacuum state of a 2D holographic CFT, and analyze the occurence of a connected-to-disconnected phase transition. The example illustrates the validity of the proposal for analytic continuation in holography for arbitrary values of R\'enyi parameter $n$. We comment on a symmetry-resolved generalization of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supertwistor and bi-supertwistor formulations for ${\mathcal N}$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four dimensions, ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$, were derived two years ago in arXiv:2108.03907. In the present paper, we introduce a novel realisation of the ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS supergroup $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ and apply it to develop a coset construction for ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ and the corresponding differential geometry. This realisation naturally leads to an atlas on ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ (that is a generalisation of the stereographic projection for a sphere) that consists of two charts with chiral transition functions for ${\mathcal N}&gt;0$. A manifestly $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant model for a superparticle in ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ is proposed. Additionally, by employing a conformal superspace approach, we describe the most general conformally flat $\mathcal N$-extended supergeometry. This construction is then specialised to the case of ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory. We discuss connections to the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Lightcone Hamiltonian for Ising Field Theory I: T &lt; T_c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 2d Ising Field Theory (IFT) in the low-temperature phase in lightcone quantization, and show that integrating out zero modes generates a very compact form for the effective lightcone interaction that depends on the finite volume vacuum expectation value of the $\sigma$ operator. This form is most naturally understood in a conformal basis for the lightcone Hilbert space. We further verify that this simple form reproduces to high accuracy results for the spectra, the $c$-function, and the form-factors from integrability methods for the magnetic deformation of IFT. For generic non-integrable values of parameters we also compute the above observables and compare our numeric results to those of equal-time truncation. In particular, we report on new measurements of various bound-state form-factors as well as the stress-tensor spectral density. We find that the stress tensor spectral density provides additional evidence that certain resonances of IFT are surprisingly narrow, even at generic strong coupling. Explicit example code for constructing the effective Hamiltonian is included in an appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytic properties and integrable structures of the meson spectrum in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$. We show that the integral equation that determines the masses of the mesons, often called the 't Hooft equation, is equivalent to finding solutions to a TQ-Baxter equation. Our analysis extends some of previous results by Fateev et al.\ to general quark masses $m=m_1=m_2$, as a perturbative series of the mass parameter. This reformulation, together with its relation to an inhomogeneous Fredholm equation, makes accessible the analytic structure of the spectrum in the complex plane of the quark masses. We also comment on applications of our techniques to non-perturbative topological string partition functions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the UV with the electroweak effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering an arbitrary bare action describing BSM physics, we use the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky resummation to obtain the most general non-local electroweak effective action at second order in the field strength. We also include the contribution of the functional measure to the effective action, which is found to modify the Higgs potential by shifting its vacuum value. The resulting effective action provides one-loop corrections to the $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, ultimately leading to the most general expression for the $\rho$ parameter at one-loop. The functional measure plays a pivotal role as it allows the parameterization of $\rho$ in inverse powers of the scale of new physics, while containing non-local form factors. The comparison of $\rho$ with the latest data leads to several constraints on the UV particle spectra of BSM models.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the study of integrable structures and analyticity of the spectrum in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ to a broad class of theories called the generalized QCD, which are given by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}\propto {\rm tr}\,B\wedge F- {\rm tr}\,V(B)$ coupled to quarks in the fundamental representation. We recast the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the meson spectrum into a TQ-Baxter equation and determine a transfer matrix in a closed form for any given polynomial $V(B)$. Using an associated Fredholm equation, we numerically study the analytic structures of the spectrum as a function of the coefficients of $V(B)$. We determine the region of couplings where the theory admits a positive and discrete spectrum of mesons. Furthermore, we uncover a multi-sheeted structure with infinitely many multi-critical points, where several mesons become simultaneously massless. Lastly, we illustrate that this structure persists in the large-representation limit of the generalized QCD with the SU(2) gauge group.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian conformal scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantization of Carrollian conformal scalar theories, including two-dimensional(2D) magnetic scalar and three-dimensional(3D) electric and magnetic scalars. We discuss two different quantization schemes, depending on the choice of the vacuum. We show that the standard canonical quantization corresponding to the induced vacuum yields a unitary Hilbert space and the 2-point correlation functions in this scheme match exactly with the ones computed from the path integral. In the canonical quantization, the BMS symmetry can be realized without anomaly. On the other hand, for the quantization based on the highest-weight vacuum, it does not have a unitary Hilbert space. In 2D, the correlators in the highest-weight vacuum agree with the ones obtained by taking the $c\to 0$ limit of the 2D CFT, and there is an anomalous term in the commutation relations between the Virasoso generators, whose form is similar to the one in 2D CFT. In 3D, there is no good definition of the highest-weight vacuum without breaking the rotational symmetry. In our study, we find that the usual state-operator correspondence in CFT does not hold in the Carrollian case.</description>

      <title>New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution is regular, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field</title>

Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from inverse magnetic to magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the full representation theory of the gravitational extended corner symmetry group in two-dimensions. This includes projective representations, which correspond to representations of the quantum corner symmetry group. We find that they are described by one-dimensional conformal fields with an additional index in the Fock space of the harmonic oscillator. We begin with a review of Mackey's theory of induced representations and then proceed to its application to the corner symmetries. The field representations, induced from the irreducible representations of the special linear group are worked out first. The little group method is then applied to the extended corner symmetry group to obtain the irreducible unitary representations. Finally, we focus on projective representations and their application to the description of local subsystems.</description>

Abstract: We explore the holographic time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) in the boundary theory of three-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime. There have been various holographic proposals for TEE in recent years and we test those proposals in the Lifshitz background. We obtain the analytic result for TEE in each proposal, compare the results, and analyze how the anisotropic scaling affects the TEE. We find that different holographic proposals give the same result for TEE in the Lifshitz background. Our analysis further suggests that the TEE of the Lifshitz system contains real and imaginary parts, both of which depend on the anisotropic parameter.</description>

Abstract: The differential representation of AdS correlators offers a framework to express exchange Witten diagrams as functions of non-local differential operators applied to contact Witten diagrams. In this paper, we develop the differential representation for scalar Carrollian correlators. We first construct this representation using the recently formulated Carrollian limit of AdS Witten diagrams. We then provide an alternate intrinsic analysis that leverages the properties of the Carrollian bulk-to-boundary propagator. Using the differential representation, we also obtain differential Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations for Carrollian correlators.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and count the microstates of out-of-equilibrium eternal AdS black holes in which a shell carrying an order one fraction of the black hole mass is emitted from the past horizon and re-absorbed at the future horizon. Our microstates have semiclassical interpretations in terms of matter propagating behind the horizon. We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the trans-series structure of a quantum mechanical system originating from a Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma model with multiple right-handed chiral fermions, extending previous results for the standard onecomplex projective ($\mathbb{CP}^1$) model [1],[2] to its deformed counterpart. We identify and analyze saddle point solutions and examine their contributions within the perturbative expansions of the ground state energy, revealing that the ambiguity structure observed in the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model persists in the deformed model as well. Additionally, we explore the role of the elongation parameter and its potential impact on higher-loop corrections, and propose that it becomes relevant in shaping the system's quantum behavior from the three-loop level. This verifies that the trans-series framework provides a comprehensive approach to capturing the structure of quantum fluctuations and ambiguities in these deformed sigma models.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a concise overview of the comprehensive version of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) derived from nonlocal quantum mechanics and extensively addressed by S. Masood, et al. We utilize the specific constraint of this GUP formulation to compute the energy correction and the modified wave function for the linear potential in one dimension. In addition, we examine the impact of deformation on a one-dimensional delta potential well and a one-dimensional delta potential barrier. Furthermore, we specifically focus on the impact of deformation on hydrogen atoms existing in one dimension, and we conduct a distinct investigation into the Stark effect on the atom.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetery For Non-Fano Varieties Via Tropical Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mirror symmetry a non-Fano variety $X$ corresponds to an instanton corrected Hori-Vafa potential $W$. The classical period of $W$ equals the regularized quantum period of $X$, which is a generating function for descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. These periods define closed mirror maps relating complex with symplectic parameters and open mirror maps relating coordinates on the mirror curves.
  We interpret the corrections to $W$ by broken lines in a scattering diagram, so that $W$ is the primitive theta function $\vartheta_1$. We show that, after wall crossing to infinity and application of the closed mirror map, $W=\vartheta_1$ is equal to the open mirror map. By tropical correspondence, $\vartheta_1$ is a generating function for $2$-marked logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants, which are algebraic analogues of counts of Maslov index $2$ disks. This generalizes the predictions of mirror symmetry to the non-Fano case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lounesto classification is a well-established scheme for categorizing spinors based on their physical content, which are determined by their associated bilinear forms. It consists of six disjoint classes encompassing the known spinors within the context of the standard model of high-energy physics. However, advancements in theories beyond the standard model have opened the door to potential new spinorial adjoint structures, leading to new unforeseen classess. These developments indicate the potential for extending the standard Lounesto classification. In this paper, we explore all possible subclasses that could extend the Lounesto scheme. We highlight the most relevant subclasses by imposing constraints to their corresponding dual structures, thus broadening our understanding of spinor and its applications in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Precise interpretations of traditional fine-tuning measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover two precise interpretations of traditional electroweak fine-tuning (FT) measures that were historically missed. (i) a statistical interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the change in plausibility of a model in which a parameter was exchanged for the $Z$ boson mass relative to an untuned model in light of the $Z$ boson mass measurement. (ii) an information-theoretic interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the exponential of the extra information, measured in nats, relative to an untuned model that you must supply about a parameter in order to fit the $Z$ mass. We derive the mathematical results underlying these interpretations, and explain them using examples from weak scale supersymmetry. These new interpretations allow us to rigorously define FT in particle physics and beyond; shed fresh light on the status of extensions to the Standard Model; and lastly, allow us to precisely reinterpret historical and recent studies using traditional FT measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained. These identities allow us to derive the exact energy spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the system based on polynomial analysis. The present method provides a unified treatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and non-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called d-quark superconducting (dSC) phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Modular flavored dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries have been an appealing approach for explaining the observed flavor structure, which is not justified in the Standard Model (SM). Typically, these models require a so-called flavon field in order to give rise to the flavor structure upon the breaking of the flavor symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the flavon. Generally, in order to obtain the desired vacuum alignment, a flavon potential that includes additional so-called driving fields is required. On the other hand, allowing the flavor symmetry to be modular leads to a structure where the couplings are all holomorphic functions that depend only on a complex modulus, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters in the model. We show that these elements can be combined to simultaneously explain the flavor structure and dark matter (DM) relic abundance. We present a modular model with flavon vacuum alignment that allows for realistic flavor predictions while providing a successful fermionic DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Pure state entanglement and von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem, stating that the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is equivalent to the majorization of their restrictions, to arbitrary factors. As a consequence, we find that in bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite single-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of pure state entanglement monotones carries over. Together with recent work on embezzlement of entanglement, this gives a one-to-one correspondence between the classification of factors into types and subtypes and operational entanglement properties. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Susy breaking soft terms in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms for all the viable models in the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The calculations are performed in the general scenario of $u$-moduli dominance with the $s$-moduli turned on, where the soft terms remain independent of the Yukawa couplings and the Wilson lines. The results for the trilinear coupling, gaugino-masses, squared-mass parameters of squarks, sleptons and Higgs depend on the brane wrapping numbers and the susy breaking parameters. We find that unlike the Yukawa couplings which remain unchanged for the models dual under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors, the corresponding soft term parameters only match for the trilinear coupling and the mass of the gluino. This can be explained by the internal geometry where the Yukawa interactions depend only on the triangular areas of the worldsheet instantons while the soft terms have an additional dependence on the orientation-angles of D6-branes in the three two-tori. In the special limit of parameter space we find universal masses for the Higgs and the gauginos.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to solve the SUSY $\mu$-problem in the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The bare $\mu$-term is forbidden by modular symmetry and the effective $\mu$-term is re-generated after the modulus field is stabilized. We discuss the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described in the non-linear realized SUSY scheme with nilpotent goldstino $X_{nl}$ superfield. The presence of $X_{nl}$ contributions can possibly slightly change the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value located in the vicinity of some fixed points. Natural value of $\mu_{eff}$, which is much smaller than the SUSY scale, can either be the consequence of expansion of typical modular forms in terms of the tiny deviation parameter (away from the fixed point $\omega$), or be the joint consequence of suppression from both powers of $q$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] and the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$.</description>
