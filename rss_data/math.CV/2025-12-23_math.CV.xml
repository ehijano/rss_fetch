      <title>Relative analytic reciprocity laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reciprocity laws involving complex line bundles on fibrations in oriented circles. In particularly, we prove the following reciprocity law. Let $B$ be a complex manifold and $\pi_i : M_i \to B$ be a fibration in oriented circles, where $i$ runs through a finite set. Let $L_i$ and $N_i$ be complex line bundles on every $M_i$. The reciprocity law states that the sum of all $(\pi_i)_* \left(c_1(L_i) \cup c_1(N_i) \right)$, where $(\pi_i)_*$ is the Gysin map and $c_1$ is the first Chern class, equals zero in $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ when the disjoint union of all $M_i$ is embedded into a holomorphic family of compact Riemann surfaces over the base $B$ such that in every fiber of this family the disjoint union of the embedded circles is the boundary of an embedded compact Riemann surface with boundary, and all $L_i$ and all $N_i$ are restrictions of holomorphic line bundles on this family.</description>

      <title>Generators in the field of hyperelliptic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the field of hyperelliptic functions defined for a family of hyperelliptic curves as rational functions in some special functions from Kleinian functions theory. We compare our definition with the classical one. We provide details and references for the result that the field of hyperelliptic functions for a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ is isomorphic to the field of rational functions with $3g$ generators. The main result of the present work is that there are no algebraic relations between these generators.</description>

      <title>Modulus estimates and cavitation in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenon of cavitation in higher-dimensional elasticity, defining it as the mapping of a punctured ball onto a non-degenerate ring domain. Crucially, for the class of locally quasiconformal mappings (or more general mappings) defined on the punctured ball $0&lt;|x|&lt;1$ in $\mathbb R^n$ that we examine, cavitation is equivalent to a failure of continuous extension to the origin. While existing modulus estimates prove insufficient for reliably detecting cavitation in this setting, our study establishes refined modulus bounds. This is achieved by introducing a novel directional dilatation which, in conjunction with the known angular dilatation, overcomes the limitations of previous methods. We illustrate our theoretical findings with several examples that demonstrate both cavitation occurrence and its absence.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Deformations of Hyperbolicity Notions on Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate deformation properties of balanced hyperbolicity, with particular emphasis on degenerate balanced manifolds and their behavior under modifications.
  In this context, we introduce two new notions of hyperbolicity for compact non-K\"ahler manifolds $X$ of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}X=n$ in degree $1 \leq p \leq n-1$, inspired by the work of F. Haggui and S. Marouani on $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity. The first notion, called \emph{p-SKT hyperbolicity}, generalizes the notions of SKT hyperbolicity and Gauduchon hyperbolicity introduced by S. Marouani. The second notion, called \emph{p-HS hyperbolicity}, extends the notion of sG hyperbolicity defined by Y. Ma.
  We investigate the relationship between these notions of analytic nature and their geometric counterparts, namely Kobayashi hyperbolicity and \emph{p-cyclic hyperbolicity} for $2 \leq p \leq n-1$, and we examine the openness under holomorphic deformations of both $p$-HS hyperbolicity and $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Bohr radius and Local Banach space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the notion of arithmetic Bohr radius for operator valued pluriharmonic functions on complete Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Using tools from local Banach space theory, we determine its asymptotic behavior in both finite and infinite dimensions. The framework developed in this article extends the classical Minkowski-space setting to a much broader class of sequence spaces, such as mixed Minkowski, Lorentz, and Orlicz spaces. This generality allows for a unified and systematic investigation of Bohr's theorem for both holomorphic and pluriharmonic functions.</description>

      <title>An interface crack in 1d piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane mechanical loading and electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study provides the consideration of a mode III interface crack in one-dimentional (1D) piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane phonon and phason loading and inplane electric field. Due to complex function approach all required electromechanical parameters are presented through vector-functions analytic in the whole complex plane except the crack region. The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region.</description>

      <title>Irrational pencils, and characterization of Varieties isogenous to a product, via the Profinite completion of the Fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a very short proof of two Theorems, whose content is outlined in the title, and where $\Pi_g$ is the fundamental group of a compact complex curve of genus $g$:
  (1) Theorem 2.1 of the irrational pencil in the profinite version, saying that for a compact K\"ahler manifold an irrational pencil, that is, a fibration onto a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, corresponds to a surjection of the profinite completion $\widehat{\pi}_1(X) \twoheadrightarrow \widehat{\Pi_g}$, which satisfies a maximality property;
  (2) Theorem 1.4 on the characterization of varieties isogenous to a product, profinite version, giving in particular a criterion for $X$ a compact K\"ahler manifold to be isomorphic to a product of curves of genera at least 2: if and only if $\widehat{\pi}_1(X) \cong \prod_1^n \widehat{\Pi_{g_i}}$, and some volume or cohomological condition is satisfied.
  Theorem 1.4 yields a stronger result than the Main Theorem A of a recent article by 5 authors.</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Pythagorean Hodograph Preserving Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize the mappings $\Phi$ that send every Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve to a PH curve. We prove that in any dimension, such mappings are precisely the conformal functions whose dilation is the square of a real rational function. In the planar case, this implies (up to conjugation) that $\partial\Phi/\partial z = \Psi^{2}$, where $\Psi$ is meromorphic and satisfies $\operatorname{Res}(\Psi^{2}) = 0$ at every pole. In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $\Phi$ to be a conformal map; for $n \ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)M\"obius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries. At the level of examples, we demonstrate how PH-preserving mappings relate to the construction of rational PH curves and minimal surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a logarithmic vanishing theorem on weakly pseudoconvex K\"ahler manifolds, where the divisor may have infinitely many irreducible components. This result serves as a generalization of Norimatsu's findings on compact K\"ahler manifolds. We derive vanishing theorems for certain direct image sheaves as a direct corollary.</description>

      <title>A nontrivial uniform algebra Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 65-year-old question of John Wermer and a 17-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modification of another 65-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <title>On Classification of compact complex surfaces of class VII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a minimal compact complex surface with Betti numbers $b_1(S)=1$ and $b_2(S)\ge 1$ i.e. a compact surface in class VII$_0^+$. We show that if there exists a twisted logarithmic 1-form $\tau\in H^0(S,\Omega^1(\log D)\otimes \mathcal L_\lambda)$, where $D$ is a non zero divisor and $\mathcal L\in H^1(S,\mathbb C^\star)$, then $S$ is a Kato surface. It is known that $\lambda$ is in fact real and we show that $\lambda\ge 1$ and unique if $S$ is not a Inoue-Hirzebruch surface. Moreover $\lambda=1$ if and only if $S$ is a Enoki surface. When $\lambda&gt;1$ these conditions are equivalent to the existence of a negative PSH function $\hat \tau$ on the cyclic covering $p:\hat S\to S$ of $S$ which is PH outside $\hat D:=p^{-1}(D)$ with automorphy constant being the same automorphy constant $\lambda$ for a suitable automorphism of $\hat S$. With previous results obtained with V.Apostolov it suggests a strategy to prove the GSS conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the intersection of positive closed currents in a general setting, employing tangent currents alongside King's residue formula. Our main result establishes a natural condition for the intersection--namely, the Dinh-Sibony product--of positive closed currents on domains and derives an integral representation of this intersection. In parallel, we study the existence, $h$-dimension, and shadow of tangent currents, extending our approach to the study of the self-intersection of analytic subsets. We also present a local version of superpotentials and a regularization of positive closed currents, explore the connections with slicing theory, and examine classical examples. Our work extends to general complex manifolds, including compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study the fixed points of the Berezin transform on the Fock-type spaces $F_m^2$ with the weight $e^{-|z|^m}, m &gt; 0.$ It is known that the Berezin transform is well-defined on the polynomials in $z$ and $\overline{z}$. In this paper we focus on the polynomial fixed points and we show that these polynomials must be harmonic, except possibly for countably many $m \in (0, \infty).$ We also show that, in some particular cases, the fixed point polynomials are harmonic for all $m.$</description>

Abstract: Let $n \geq 1$, and let $p : {\bf C} \to {\bf C}$ be a monic polynomial of degree $n$. It was conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian that the maximal length of lemniscate $\{z \in {\bf C}: |p(z)| = 1\}$ is attained by the polynomial $p(z) = z^n-1$. In this paper, building upon a previous analysis of Fryntov and Nazarov, we establish this conjecture for all sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Volterra-Type Integral Operators on Hardy Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $n$-fold iterated Volterra-type integral operator $T_{g,n}$ acting on Hardy spaces, defined by \[ T_{g,n}[f](z) :=\underbrace{\int_0^z\int_0^{t_1}\cdots\int_0^{t_{n-1}}}_{n\ \text{times}} f(t_n)g'(t_n)\,dt_n\cdots dt_1, \quad z\in\mathbb{D}, \] where $f$ and $g$ are analytic functions in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. We show that the boundedness and compactness of $T_{g,n}$ are independent of the order $n$ and depend solely on the symbol $g$. In particular, we obtain sharp norm estimates and characterize boundedness and compactness of $T_{g,n}$ in terms of classical function space conditions on $g$.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Pointwise rotation for homeomorphisms with integrable distortion and controlled compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp rotation bounds for homeomorphisms $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ whose distortion is in $L^p_{loc}$, $p\geq1$, and whose inverse have controlled modulus of continuity. The motivation to study this class of maps comes from so-called Yudovich solutions to planar Euler equations. Furthermore, we present examples proving sharpness in a strong sense, thereby settling the borderline case $p=1$ in \cite[Theorem 3]{CHS}.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the Variational Principle and develop thermodynamic formalism for correspondences. We define the measure-theoretic entropy for transition probability kernels and topological pressure for correspondences. Based on these two notions, we establish the following results:
  The Variational Principle holds and equilibrium states exist for continuous potential functions, provided that the correspondence satisfies some expansion property called forward expansiveness. If, in addition, the correspondence satisfies the specification property and the potential function is Bowen summable, then the equilibrium state is unique. On the other hand, for a distance-expanding, open, strongly transitive correspondence and a H\"{o}lder continuous potential function, there exists a unique equilibrium state, and the backward orbits are equidistributed. Furthermore, we investigate the Variational Principle for general correspondences.
  In complex dynamics, we establish the Variational Principle for the Lee-Lyubich-Markorov-Mukherjee anti-holomorphic correspondences, which are matings of some anti-ho\-lo\-mor\-phic rational maps with anti-Hecke groups and are not forward expansive. We also show a Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius theorem for a family of hyperbolic holomorphic correspondences of the form $\boldsymbol{f}_c (z)= z^{q/p}+c$.</description>

      <title>Weighted composition operators on Hilbert function spaces on the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A weighted composition operator on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is given by a composition, followed by a multiplication. We study unitary and co-isometric weighted composition operators on unitarily invariant spaces on the Euclidean unit ball $\mathbb B_d$. We establish a dichotomy between the spaces $\mathcal{H}_\gamma$ with reproducing kernel $(1 - \langle z,w \rangle)^{-\gamma}$ for $\gamma &gt; 0$, and all other spaces. Whereas the former admit many unitary weighted composition operators, the latter only admit trivial ones. This extends results of Mart\'in, Mas and Vukoti\'c from the disc to the ball. Some of our results continue to hold when $d = \infty$.</description>

      <title>The shrinking target and recurrence problem for non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results.
  Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>
