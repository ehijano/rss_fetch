      <title>Automatic skull-template alignment without a guidance image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound must overcome the significant challenge of the human skull, limiting both imaging and therapeutic applications. While high-fidelity numerical simulations can compensate for skull-induced distortions, they require precise skull templates (typically derived from Computed Tomography, CT) and spatial alignment to the patient's anatomy. Current alignment relies on concurrent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for registration, introducing financial, logistical, and throughput barriers. To overcome these challenges, we present Manifold Optimisation for Full-Waveform Inversion (MOFI), a method to register skull templates without using a guidance image. Our method aligns the skull template by minimising the difference between simulated and observed radio-frequency acoustic data. We demonstrate that MOFI accurately recovers the position of skull templates in silico and in vitro, offering an alternative to MRI guidance-based registration. These results indicate that MOFI has the potential to be a practical alternative to MRI-guided approaches, reducing the barriers to wider clinical adoption of transcranial ultrasound.</description>

      <title>Dosimetry for Proton Therapy Using a \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Detector with Low-Noise Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) employs proton radiation rather than conventional X-rays to treat cancerous tumors. This approach offers significant advantages by minimizing the radiation exposure of surrounding healthy tissue, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects compared to traditional X-ray therapy. To ensure patient safety, each treatment plan must be experimentally validated before clinical implementation. However, current dosimetry devices face limitations in performing angled beam measurements and obtaining multi-depth assessments, both of which are essential for verifying IMPT treatment plans. In this study, the performance of a \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector with a low-noise amplifier is studied and evaluated under various proton radiation doses and energy levels delivered by a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The detector performance is also compared with that of an ionization chamber. The \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector exhibits a linear response with proton dose for single-spot irradiations, and its response to varying proton energies closely matches both the ion chamber data and simulated dose distributions. These findings highlight the potential of \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based detectors as robust dosimetry devices for IMPT applications.</description>

      <title>Morphology-, Noise-, and Resolution-Robust Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging with Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound-based elasticity imaging is a non-invasive technique for estimating tissue stiffness fields from displacement fields obtained by comparing ultrasound signals before and after compression. While recent deep learning approaches have enabled faster and more accurate elasticity estimation compared to traditional methods, several challenges remain for clinical translation. In this study, we employ finite element simulations of free-hand palpation to investigate the applicability of the Fourier neural operator (FNO). Four practical scenarios were investigated: (1) prediction across diverse lesion morphologies, (2) generalization to cases with lesion counts differing from those in the training data, (3) robustness to noise in measured displacement fields, and (4) resilience to variations in ultrasound device resolution. Across these tasks, FNO consistently outperformed baseline models such as U-Net and DeepONet in predictive accuracy and generalization, while maintaining robustness under noise and resolution changes. Validated through in silico simulations, these findings demonstrate the potential of FNO as a framework that could facilitate translation of elasticity imaging toward clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Beyond directions: Rotation sets for triaxial diffusion encoding by geometric filter optimization (GFO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We aim to improve the accuracy of the diffusion-weighted powder average signal for diffusion encoding with arbitrary shape. This enables a categorical improvement in all quantification based on, for example, tensor-valued diffusion encoding at no additional cost to acquisition time.
  Methods: We propose a method to generate optimal rotation sets that are applied to the diffusion encoding gradient waveform to yield powder averages with maximal accuracy. The method, termed ``Geometric Filter Optimization'' (GFO), amounts to designing an appropriate sampling filter which is approximately flat in the relevant part of the associated frequency space. We characterize the filter properties and benchmark the performance in terms of the accuracy and precision of powder averages and higher order rotational invariants.
  Results: GFO filters were found to have much smaller spectral leakage than other designs. We found that GFO leads to marked improvements in precision and accuracy in powder averaging over generic diffusion encoding objects, and similarly in higher order rotational invariants, although for sufficiently high $b$ and $N$, accuracy, but not precision, deteriorated compared to electrostatic repulsion.
  Conclusion: GFO provides an efficient recipe for obtaining orientations for powder averaging of signals with non-axisymmetric diffusion encoding. It places no additional demands on gradient system performance and can be used to shorten scan time.</description>

      <title>LiDRoSIS: An Automated MATLAB-Python Platform for Image Processing and Quantitative Analysis of Lipid Droplets and ROS in Irradiated Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDRoSIS is an automated MATLAB-Python software suite for the segmentation and quantification of lipid droplets (LDs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fluorescence microscopy images of irradiated A549 and MCF7 cells exposed to gold-based nanoparticles. It combines classical image processing algorithms with statistical post-analysis through a companion Python tool, StatLysis. The platform enables reproducible, high-throughput analysis of morphological and spectral parameters linked to nanoparticle-enhanced radiobiological responses. By bridging imaging and quantitative analytics, LiDRoSIS provides a robust framework for nanomedicine and radiation biology research.</description>

      <title>A combined dose and microdosimetric modeling framework incorporating volume effects correlates with tissue sparing in proton minibeam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton minibeam (pMB) radiotherapy, delivers highly heterogeneous dose distributions alternating high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys. This aims to widen the therapeutic window by improving normal tissue sparing while maintaining the same or even better tumour control. The performance of pMB strongly depends on the collimator design and physical parameters. To better understand the physical and radiobiological drivers of this enhanced therapeutic window, we perform a detailed microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeams and assess their impact.
  We characterize radiation quality with microdosimetry through Monte Carlo simulations. Then we extend the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model to predict the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) at different depths in water, 1cm, 2cm, and 4cm, for 100MeV proton minibeams realized with varying configurations of collimator. Results are compared with conventional homogeneous field (HF) irradiation after dose normalization to the tumor. The developed model is applied by considering tissues as divided into several functional subunits, connected by a seriality parameter.
  Microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeam irradiation shows differences between peak and valley regions in shaping lineal energy spectra, especially at low depth, while radiation quality uniforms progressively getting closer to the tumor. NTCP calculations results suggest an increased sparing effect for pMB over conventional HF. A strong dependence is found on the peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and on the seriality parameter. Predictions indicate substantial sparing from pMB, especially for PVDR &gt; 15, including relatively serial organs with seriality around 0.7.
  This integrated dose-microdosimetric-biological framework elucidates how spatial fractionation, radiation quality, and organ architecture collectively shape tissue sparing in pMB.</description>
