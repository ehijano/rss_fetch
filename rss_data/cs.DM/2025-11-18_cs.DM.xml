      <title>Optimal and Efficient Partite Decompositions of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the edges of a $d$-uniform hypergraph $H$ into a family $F$ of complete $d$-partite hypergraphs ($d$-cliques). We show that there is a partition $F$ in which every vertex $v \in V(H)$ belongs to at most $(\frac{1}{d!} + o_d(1))n^{d-1}/\lg n$ members of $F$. This settles the central question of a line of research initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Pyber (1997) for graphs, and more recently by Csirmaz, Ligeti, and Tardos (2014) for hypergraphs. The $d=2$ case of this theorem answers a 40-year-old question of Chung, Erd\H{o}s, and Spencer (1983). An immediate corollary of our result is an improved upper bound for the maximum share size for binary secret sharing schemes on uniform hypergraphs.
  Building on results of Nechiporuk (1969), we prove that every graph with fixed edge density $\gamma \in (0,1)$ has a biclique partition of total weight at most $(\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))\cdot h_2(\gamma) \frac{n^2}{\lg n}$, where $h_2$ is the binary entropy function. Our construction implies that such biclique partitions can be constructed in time $O(m)$, which answers a question of Feder and Motwani (1995) and also improves upon results of Mubayi and Tur\'an (2010) as well as Chavan, Rabinia, Grosu, and Brocanelli (2025). Using similar techniques, we also give an $n^{1+o(1)}$ algorithm for finding a subgraph $K_{t,t}$ with $t = (1-o(1)) \frac{\gamma}{h_2(\gamma)} \lg n$.
  Our results show that biclique partitions are information-theoretically optimal representations for graphs at every fixed density. We show that with this succinct representation one can answer independent set queries and cut queries in time $O(n^2/ \lg n)$, and if we increase the space usage by a constant factor, we can compute a $2\alpha$-approximation for the densest subgraph problem in time $O(n^2/\lg \alpha)$ for any $\alpha &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Explicit M-Polynomial and Degree-Based Topological Indices of Generalized Hanoi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The M-polynomial, introduced by Deutsch and Klav\v{z}ar in 2015, provides a unifying algebraic framework for the computation of numerous degree-based topological indices such as the Zagreb, Randic, harmonic, and forgotten indices. Despite its broad applications in chemical graph theory and network analysis, closed expressions of the M-polynomial remain unknown for many important graph families.
  In this work we derive, for the first time, a complete explicit expression of the M-polynomial of the generalized Hanoi graphs $H_p^n$ for arbitrary positive $p$ and $n$. Our derivation relies on a detailed combinatorial analysis of the occupancy-based structure of $H_p^n$, refined using Stirling and $2$-associated Stirling numbers to enumerate all configurations with prescribed singleton and multiton counts. We obtain closed formulas for all diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients of the M-polynomial and show how these expressions yield exact values of the main degree-based topological indices. The correctness of the formulas is supported through numerical computation in small instances. These results provide a complete degree-based description of $H_p^n$ and make their structural complexity fully accessible through the M-polynomial framework.</description>

      <title>Rankwidth of Graphs with Balanced Separations: Expansion for Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every graph of rankwidth at least $72r$ contains an induced subgraph whose minimum balanced cutrank is at least $r$, which implies a vertex subset where every balanced separation has $\mathbb{F}_2$-cutrank at least $r$. This implies a novel relation between rankwidth and a well-linkedness measure, defined entirely by balanced vertex cuts. As a byproduct, our result supports the notion of rank-expansion as a suitable candidate for measuring expansion in dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Sharp Uncertainty Principle for Transitive $G$-Sets over Arbitrary Fields and Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any finite group $G$, any transitive $G$-set $X$ and any field ${\Bbb F}$, we consider the vector space ${\Bbb F}^X$ of all functions from $X$ to ${\Bbb F}$, which is a $G$-space isomorphic to the permutation ${\Bbb F} G$-module ${\Bbb F} X$. When the group algebra ${\Bbb F} G$ is semisimple and split, we find a specific basis $\widehat X$ of ${\Bbb F}^X$ and, for $f\in{\Bbb F}^X$, construct the Fourier transform $\widehat f\in{\Bbb F}^{\widehat X}$. We define the rank support $\mbox{rk-supp}(\widehat f)$ and prove that $\mbox{rk-supp}(\widehat f)=\dim {\Bbb F} G f$, where ${\Bbb F} G f$ is the submodule of ${\Bbb F} X$ generated by the element $f=\sum_{x\in X}f(x)x$. Next, we extend and strengthen the sharpened uncertainty principle for finite abelian groups, established by Feng, Hollmann, and Xiang in 2019, to a broader framework and a sharp version. For $0\ne f\in{\Bbb F}^X$, we construct a block $X_{{\rm supp}(f)}$ of $X$ and a subset ${\mathscr S}'^{-\!1}$ of $G$ determined by the support ${\rm supp}(f)$ of $f$, and show that $\dim{\Bbb F} Gf-\dim{\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-\!1}\!f\ge 1$ and $$
  |{\rm supp}(f)|\cdot \dim{\Bbb F} Gf
  \ge |X|+ (\!\dim{\Bbb F} Gf-\dim{\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-1}f)
  \cdot|{\rm supp}(f)| -|X_{{\rm supp}(f)}|, $$ where ${\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-1}f$ denotes the subspace of ${\Bbb F}X$ spanned by the subset ${\mathscr S}'^{-1}f=\{\alpha f\,|\,\alpha\in{\mathscr S}'^{-1}\}\subseteq{\Bbb F} X$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the above inequality to achieve equality. As corollaries, we derive many sharpened or classical versions of the finite-dimensional uncertainty principle, address an open question posed by Feng, Hollmann, and Xiang. When $|G|$ is a prime and $X=G$, we give a lower bound on $\dim {\Bbb F}Gf$ that recovers Tao's 2005 strong uncertainty principle, along with a precise characterization of the equality case.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: A Simple Algorithm for Vertex Separators in Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that a simple polynomial-time algorithm that we call reweighted spectral partitioning obtains small 2/3-balanced vertex-separators for a number of graph classes, including $O(\sqrt{n})$-sized separators for planar graphs, $O(\min\{(\log g)^2,\log\Delta\}\cdot\sqrt{gn})$-sized separators for genus-$g$ graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, and $O(\min\{\log h,\sqrt{\log\Delta}\}(h\log h\log\log h)\sqrt{n})$-sized separators for $K_h$-minor-free graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.
  To accomplish this, we first obtain a refined form of a Cheeger-style inequality relating the vertex expansion of a graph and the solution to a semidefinite program defined over the graph. Then, to obtain the guarantees for specific graph classes, we derive direct bounds on the value of the semidefinite program.
  We also obtain several other results of independent interest, including an improved separator theorem for the intersection graphs of $d$-dimensional balls with bounded ply, a new bound on the Fiedler value of genus-$g$ graphs, and a new "spectral" proof of the planar separator theorem.</description>

      <title>Support Recovery in One-bit Compressed Sensing with Near-Optimal Measurements and Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $\Omega(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. For the universal $\epsilon$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(k\epsilon^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(\epsilon^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.</description>
